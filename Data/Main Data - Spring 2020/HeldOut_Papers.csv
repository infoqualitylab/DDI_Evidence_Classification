16514303,Pharmacokinetic interaction between nelfinavir and pravastatin in HIV-seronegative volunteers: ACTG Study A5108.,"Nelfinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor with numerous drug-drug interactions, is associated with dyslipidemia. Pravastatin is the preferred statin prescribed for HIV-associated dyslipidemia. To examine the effect of nelfinavir on pravastatin pharmacokinetics. Open-label study in healthy HIV-seronegative adults conducted at the AIDS Clinical Trials Group sites in the United States. Subjects received pravastatin 40 mg daily and underwent intensive sampling for pharmacokinetics on day 3. Subjects took only nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily on days 4-12. On days 13-15, subjects continued nelfinavir and reinitiated pravastatin. Plasma samples were collected over 24 h for the calculation of pravastatin area under the conce+C2ntration-time curve for 0-24 h on days 3 and 16. Data from 14 subjects with complete pharmacokinetic samples were available for analysis. The median within-subject percentage change in pravastatin AUC was a decrease of 46.5%. Pravastatin maximum plasma concentrations were also lower when pravastatin was administered with nelfinavir. Median values for the maximum pl+C5asma concentrations were 27.9 and 12.4 ng/ml for days 3 and 16, respectively, and the median within-subject decrease was 40.1%. Coadministration of pravastatin and nelfinavir led to a substantial reduction in pravastatin plasma concentrations. Higher doses of pravastatin may need to be prescribed in order to achieve optimal lipid-lowering activity.","Methods
The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study A5108 was a phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, pharmacokinetic drug interaction study. The primary objectives were to examine the effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin and the effect of NFV on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. The efavirenz_statin interactions were recently published [4]. The data presented here address the effect of NFVon the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. At the time of this study design, NFV was the most commonly prescribed PI in antiretroviral-naive patients.

Subjects
Healthy HIV-seronegative volunteers were recruited. The planned sample size was 14 subjects. Subjects who did not complete both pharmacokinetics evaluations were replaced. Subjects were accrued to the NFV arm from August through December 2001.

Study design
Subjects self-administered pravastatin 40 mg daily in the morning for the first 3 days and on the fourth day pravastatin was administered under observation. Blood samples were obtained before drug administration as well as 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after administration, for pravastatin pharmacokinetics. On days 4 through 12, subjects took NFV 1250 mg twice daily with meals. On days 13 through 15, subjects continued NFV and restarted pravastatin with the morning dose of NFV. On day 16, pravastatin and NFV doses were administered under observation and samples were collected over 24 h for pravastatin pharmacokinetics. Fasting serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high density lipoprotein concentrations were measured at baseline and on days 3, 13, and 16 using standard enzymatic assays. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) was calculated using the Friedewald equation. Adherence to study medications was measured using pill counts and questionnaires.

The human subjects committees of each participating institution and the Division of AIDS, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, approved this study and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

Pravastatin assay
Samples for pravastatin plasma concentrations were analyzed by Advion Biosciences Inc. (Ithaca, New York, USA) as previously published [2,4].

Statistical analyses
The primary endpoint was the pravastatin AUC from 0 to 24 h before and after coadministration of NFV. Values for AUC were estimated according to the linear trapezoidal rule [5] implemented using a macro written in SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). There was no extrapolation beyond the dosing interval. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), defined as the maximum concentration observed throughout the dosing interval, was also analyzed statistically. If both the 0 and 24 h concentrations or if both study day samples were unavailable for a given subject, pharmacokinetics parameters were not calculated. The Wilcoxon signed rank test [6], applied to within-subject differences in AUC and in Cmax values, was used to test the null hypothesis of no difference in pravastatin exposure before initiation of NFV versus after dosing to steady state. Values of Cmax were of interest because high plasma concentrations of statins may be associated with toxicity [7]. Pravastatin exposure when taken with NFV relative to when taken alone, median within-subject differences, and 90% confidence intervals (CI) around geometric mean ratios are reported. The last are recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration to evaluate bioequivalence and drug interactions [8].",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
19033449,Enantioselectivity in the pharmacokinetic interaction between fluvastatin and lercanidipine in healthy volunteers.,"Hypertension and dyslipidemia are independent risk factors for cardiovascular mortality and are frequently present in the same patient. Fluvastatin (FV), used to reduce cholesterol levels, and lercanidipine (LER), used to control blood pressure, are marketed as racemic mixtures. Therapeutic activities are 30-fold higher for (+)-3R, 5S-FV and 100- to 200-fold higher for S-LER compared with their respective antipodes. The present study describes the enantioselective pharmacokinetic interaction between LER and FV in healthy volunteers. A crossover randomized study was conducted in 3 phases on 8 volunteers treated with a single oral racemic dose of LER (20 mg) or FV (40 mg) or LER plus FV. Serial blood samples were collected from 0 to 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of the LER and FV enantiomers were determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using the WinNonlin software. The Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests (P < .05) were used to analyze enantiomer ratios and the pharmacokinetic drug interaction. Data are expressed as medians. In monotherapy, the kinetic disposition of both FV and LER was enantioselective. AUC values were significantly higher for (-)-3S,5R-FV than for (+)-3R,5S-FV (358.20 vs 279.68 ng.h/mL) and for S-LER compared with R-LER (13.90 vs 11.88 ng.h/mL). The pharmacokinetic parameters of FV were not enantioselective when combined with LER (AUC: (-)-3S,5R-FV: 325.21; (+)-3R,5S-FV: 316.44 ng.h/mL). There was a significant reduction in S-LER (8.06 vs 13.90 ng.h/mL) and R-LER (6.76 vs 11.88 ng.h/mL) AUC values when FV was coadministered. In conclusion, the interaction between FV-LER might be clinically relevant because AUC values of (+)-3R,5S-FV were increased when LER was coadministered, and AUC values of the 2 LER enantiomers were reduced when FV was coadministered.","PATIENTS AND METHODS
Eight healthy female volunteers ranging in age from
19 to 33 years (median: 23, confidence interval [CI]:
21.0-28.8) and weighing 54 to 70 kg, with a median
body mass index of 21.3 kg/m2 (CI: 18.7-23.4), were
investigated after clinical and physical examination.
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of the University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine of
Ribeir†o Preto, University of S†o Paulo, S†o Paulo,
Brazil, and was conducted in accordance with good
clinical practice (protocol 9576/2006). Each volunteer
gave written consent to participate after receiving
written and verbal information about the study.
The volunteers were required to abstain from any
medication and alcohol for 15 days prior to the
study.
Clinical Protocol
Each volunteer received in a random sequence 3 different
drug regimens lasting for 24 hours, which
were separated by washout periods of at least 7 days.
The drugs were administered as single oral doses as
follows: 20 mg racemic LER (Zanidip, 10-mg tablets,
Medley, Campinas, Brazil) or 40 mg racemic FV
(Lescol, Novartis, Tabo†o da Serra, S†o Paulo,
Brazil) or a combination of 20 mg racemic LER and
40 mg racemic FV with 200 mL water after an
overnight fast. Three and 12 hours after dosing, a
light breakfast and dinner were given to each volunteer,
respectively. Serial blood samples (10 mL)
were collected through an intravenous catheter at
predose (0 hours) and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0,
2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10, 12, and 24 hours postdose.
The blood samples were transferred to tubes
containing heparin (Liquemine, 5000 IU, Roche, S†o
Paulo, Brazil) and were protected from light. The
samples were centrifuged (10 minutes at 2000 g),
and plasma was separated and stored at _70çC until
the time of chromatographic analysis.
Sample size estimation after the study was based on
pharmacokinetic variability measured in the healthy
volunteers included in the present investigation. For

S-LER, the mean area under the curve (AUC) (n = 8)
was 14.66 ng_h/mL (SD 10.81 ng_h/mL). To detect
differences higher than 50% between the 2 groups,
an 80% power and 5% type I error would be
achieved with a minimum sample size of 7 per
group. For (+)-3R,5S-FV, the mean AUC (n = 8) was
406.19 ng_h/mL (SD 176.50 ng_h/mL). To detect differences
higher than 50% between the 2 groups, an
80% power and 5% type I error would be achieved
with a minimum sample size of 6 per group.
Stereoselective Analysis of Lercanidipine
Plasma concentrations of R- and S-LER were determined
by an enantioselective liquid chromatography/
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method
in a Quattro Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
(Micromass, Manchester, UK) using an electrospray
interface in the positive ion mode as described
by Jabor et al.9 Briefly, 25 _L of the internal standard
(0.66 _g/mL amiodarone) and 50 _L sodium
hydroxide solution (0.1 mol/L) were added to the
plasma samples (1.0 mL), and the LER enantiomers
were extracted with 4.5 mL of a mixture of hexaneisopropanol
(99:1, v/v) by shaking in a vortex mixer
for 2 minutes. After centrifugation, the organic
phases were collected and evaporated to dryness,
and the residues were dissolved in 50 _L hexaneethanol
(95:5, v/v) plus 0.1% (v/v) diethylamine.
Aliquots (20 _L) of the final extracts were analyzed
by LC/MS/MS on a Chiralpak AD column (250 _ 4.6
mm i.d., 10-_m particle size; Chiral Technologies,
Inc, Exton, Pennsylvania) using a LiChrospher 100
RP-18 guard column (4 _ 4 mm i.d., 5 _m; Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) and a mobile phase consisting
of amixture of hexane-ethanol-diethylamine (95:5:0.1,
v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1.3 mL/min. Tandem mass
spectrometry detection was carried out by postcolumn
infusion consisting of the addition of an aqueous
solution of 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate in
ethanol (5:95, v/v). For multiple-reaction monitoring
(MRM), the ammonium adducts [M + NH4]+ and
their respective product ions were monitored using 2
functions: 612.40 > 100.10 (0.0_5.0 minutes) for
the LER enantiomers and 646.30 > 100.30 (5.0-8.0
minutes) for the internal standard. The quantification
limit was 0.025 ng/mL for each LER enantiomer.
Linearity of the method was observed over a range of
0.025 to 50 ng/mL for each LER enantiomer.
Precision and accuracy showed a coefficient of variation
and relative errors of less than 15%. No matrix
effects were observed.
Stereoselective Analysis of Fluvastatin
Plasma concentrations of (_)-3S,5R-FV and (+)-
3R,5S-FV were determined by an enantioselective
LC/MS/MS method in a Quattro Micro triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass) using an
electrospray interface in the negative ion mode as
described by Di Pietro et al.10 Briefly, 25 _L of the
internal standard (1 _g/mL warfarin), 1 mL 0.75 M
acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and 5 mL diisopropyl ether
were added to 0.5-mL aliquots of human plasma.
The samples were extracted in a horizontal shaker
for 30 minutes and centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 minutes.
The organic phases were collected and evaporated
to dryness, and the residues were dissolved in
50 _L of the mobile phase. Aliquots (20 _L) of the
final extracts were analyzed by LC/MS/MS on a
Chiralcel OD-R chiral column (Chiral Technologies,
Inc; 250 _ 4.6 mm i.d., particle size of 10 _m)
equipped with a LiChrospher 100 CN precolumn (4
_ 4 mm i.d., particle size of 5 _m; Merck). The
mobile phase consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile,
methanol, and water (24:36:40, v/v/v) containing
0.1% formic acid and was used at a flow rate of 0.7
mL/min. The column was kept at a temperature of
30 ± 1çC. The analyses were performed in the
selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. Two transitions
(410.6 > 348.2 for the FV enantiomers and
307.1 > 161.6 for the internal standard) were monitored.
All analytical procedures were performed
under yellow light because of the photosensitivity of
FV. The quantification limit was 0.75 ng/mL for
each FV enantiomer. Linearity of the method was
observed over a range of 0.75 to 625 ng/mL for each
FV enantiomer. Precision and accuracy showed a
coefficient of variation and relative errors of less
than 15%. No matrix effects were observed.
Pharmacokinetic and Statistical Analysis
The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated
based on the plasma enantiomer concentration
versus time curves using the WinNonlin program,
Version 4.0 (Pharsight Corp, Mountain View,
California).
The experimental data were analyzed statistically
using the Graphpad Instat software for the
calculation of the mean, the median, and 95% confidence
interval. Data were compared using a
nonparametric test for paired data (comparison
between enantiomers), with the level of significance
set at P _ .05.",DDI Randomized clinical trials
10587283,Pharmacokinetic interaction of fluvoxamine and thioridazine in schizophrenic patients.,"This study investigated to what extent fluvoxamine affects the pharmacokinetics of thioridazine (THD) in schizophrenic patients under steady-state conditions. Concentrations of THD, mesoridazine, and sulforidazine were measured in plasma samples obtained from 10 male inpatients, aged 36 to 78 years, at three different time points: A, during habitual monotherapy with THD at 88 +/-54 mg/day; B, after addition of a low dosage of fluvoxamine (25 mg twice a day) for 1 week; and C, 2 weeks after fluvoxamine discontinuation. After the addition of fluvoxamine, THD concentrations relative to time point A significantly increased approximately threefold from 0.40 to 1.21 micromol/L (225%) (p < 0.002), mesoridazine concentrations increased from 0.65 to 2.0 micromol/L (219%) (p < 0.004), and sulforidazine levels increased from 0.21 to 0.56 micromol/L (258%) (p < 0.004). The THD-mesoridazine and THD-sulforidazine ratios remained unchanged during the study. Mean plasma THD, mesoridazine, and sulforidazine levels decreased at time point C, but despite fluvoxamine discontinuation for 2 weeks, three patients continued to exhibit elevated concentrations of THD and its metabolites. In conclusion, fluvoxamine markedly interferes with the metabolism of THD, probably at the CYP2C19 and/or CYP1A2 enzyme level. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the potential for a clinical drug interaction between both compounds, and careful monitoring of THD levels is valuable to prevent the accumulation of the drug and resulting toxicity.","Methods
Patients
Ten male inpatients, six smokers and four nonsmokers, who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia participated in our study. The demographic
features of the patients are displayed in Table 1. According to Spanish law for clinical trials, the patients were aware of the purpose and gave oral consent for
participation in the presence of a witness who was not involved in the study. Patients' competency had previously been assessed by two experienced
psychiatrists, one who was not involved in the investigation. Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the ""Infanta Cristina"" University Hospital
(Badajoz, Spain), and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions
Exclusion criteria included patients with severe medical illness, clinically significant abnormalities in the prestudy physical examination or laboratory test
results, positive history of allergy or adverse drug reactions, and history of epilepsy or seizure. None of the patients had taken any psychoactive drug other
than THD for at least 3 months before the study, and no concomitant medication, other than the agents used in the investigation, was allowed for the duration
of the study. All subjects were nonalcohol drinkers and underwent a complete physical and psychiatric examination, electrocardiographic (ECG) analysis,
urinalysis, and clinical laboratory panels for chemistry and hematology before study admission. ECGs and all laboratory tests were repeated at all plasma
concentration measurements during the study.
The Mini-Mental State Examination and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale were administered upon admission. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
(BPRS)23 and the Nordic Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU, Selection for Clinical Investigations) scale 24 were used to evaluate clinical status and side
effects, respectively.
All patients received monotherapy with THD (Meleril(R), Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) at bedtime (approximately 10 p.m.) as the habitual treatment
for the management of schizophrenia at a mean dose of 88 mg/day (range, 30-200 mg/day). Fluvoxamine 50 mg/day was administered for 1 week. Half of the
daily dose was ingested at 8 a.m. and the other half at 8 p.m. At 8 a.m., blood samples were obtained for examination of plasma levels of THD, mesoridazine,
and sulforidazine from each subject (N = 10) at three different time points: A, during habitual THD therapy; B, after 1 week of concomitant administration of
THD and fluvoxamine; and C, after 2 weeks of fluvoxamine discontinuation. Plasma was separated after centrifugation and was stored frozen at
-20[degrees]C until assayed.
CYP2D6 genotyping
Venous blood samples (10-20 mL) were obtained from each subject and were stored in heparinized (sodium heparin 143 USP units) sterile glass tubes
(Vacutainer(R), Becton Dickinson Systems, Europe. B.P. No. 37-38241, Meylan Cedex, France) and stored at -80[degrees]C until DNA isolation. Genomic DNA
was purified from peripheral leukocytes using standard protocols 25 and was stored in sterile plastic vials at 4[degrees]C until analysis.
The CYP2D6 genotyping was carried out by the combined use of mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction and restriction mapping with the enzymes
EcoRI and XbaI as described elsewhere.26-28 The analyses performed permitted the identification of the wild type (wt) allelic variants CYP2D6*1, two active
allelic variants (CYP2D6*2 and CYP2D6*9), two defective allelic variants (CYP2D6*3 and CYP2D6*4), and the occurrence of complete gene deletion
(CYP2D6*5) as well as gene duplications or amplifications (CYP2D6*x2 and CYP2D6*xn). This method has a predictive capacity of approximately 95% of
CYP2D6 metabolism.29
Plasma concentration assay of THD, mesoridazine, and sulforidazine
The concentrations of THD and its major metabolites in plasma, mesoridazine and sulforidazine, were measured under light-protected conditions 30 (in
duplicate) by a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method in the following manner: To 0.5 mL of plasma, 2.5 mL of 0.5 M ammonium
hydroxide, 400 [mu]L of diisopropylether and 100 [mu]L (15 [mu]g/mL) of the internal standard (promethazine) were added. The extracted residue was
dissolved again in 40 [mu]L of mobile phase, and 20 [mu]L were injected into a Spherisorb silica (3-[mu]m particle size, 250 x 4.6 mm) straight-phase column
(Sugelabor SA, Madrid, Spain). The column was eluted isocratically with a mobile phase containing 72.2% acetonitrile, 27.4% methanol, and 0.4% of
ammonia solution (25%). The flow rate was 1.4 mL/min, and compounds were monitored by ultraviolet absorbance at 267 nm. The retention times of the
internal standard, sulforidazine, THD, and mesoridazine were 5.7, 8.4, 9.7, and 18.7 minutes, respectively. Fluvoxamine was not detectable within 20 minutes
of analysis under the chromatographic conditions described. Standard curves were made with drug-free plasma spiked with THD and mesoridazine in the
range of 0.25-5.0 [mu]mol/L and sulforidazine in the range of 0.1-1 [mu]mol/L (r > 0.99 for all compounds). The reproducibility and accuracy of the assay were
determined by analysis of a set of quality-control samples (N = 10). The within-run coefficient of variation (CV) was 3.7% for THD at 1.0 [mu]mol/L, 2.6% for
mesoridazine at 1.0 [mu]mol/L, and 4.5% for sulforidazine at 0.5 [mu]mol/L. The day-to-day CV was 7.7% for THD, 6.3% for mesoridazine, and 8.6% for
sulforidazine. The limit of determination was estimated to be 0.03 [mu]mol/L for THD and sulforidazine and 0.1 [mu]mol/L for mesoridazine.
The HPLC equipment consisted of a model 110B solvent delivery module, a model 166 detector, and a model 507 automatic injector (all from Beckman
Instruments, Inc., Madrid, Spain). A computer-assisted ""System Gold"" HPLC software (version 8.1) (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Madrid, Spain) was used to
operate modules and facilitate data management.
Data analysis
All results are reported as mean +/- SD. Plasma concentrations of THD, mesoridazine, and sulforidazine were expressed in [mu]mol/L. Normal distribution for
variables could not be assumed (Shapiro-Wilk test). Thus, a nonparametric statistical analysis, the Friedman rank test, was used to compare plasma
concentrations at the three different time points A, B, and C (repeated measures). If a significant value was obtained (p <= 0.05), post hoc Tukey procedure for
multiple pairwise comparisons was also applied. The p values are all two-tailed.",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
21876043,Pharmacokinetics of voriconazole administered concomitantly with fluconazole and population-based simulation for sequential use.,"In clinical practice, antifungal therapy may be switched from fluconazole to voriconazole; such sequential use poses the potential for drug interaction due to cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19)-mediated inhibition of voriconazole metabolism. This open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study investigated the effect of concomitant fluconazole on voriconazole pharmacokinetics in 10 subjects: 8 extensive metabolizers and 2 poor metabolizers of CYP2C19. The study consisted of 4-day voriconazole-only and 5-day voriconazole-plus-fluconazole treatments, separated by a 14-day washout. Voriconazole pharmacokinetics were determined by noncompartmental analyses. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed in Simcyp (Simcyp Ltd., Sheffield, United Kingdom) to predict the magnitude of drug interaction should antifungal therapy be switched from fluconazole to voriconazole, following various simulated lag times for the switch. In CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers, fluconazole increased the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of voriconazole by 57% and 178%, respectively. In poor metabolizers, however, voriconazole pharmacokinetics were unaffected by fluconazole. The simulations based on pharmacokinetic modeling predicted that if voriconazole was started 6, 12, 24, or 36 h after the last dose of fluconazole, the voriconazole AUC ratios (sequential therapy versus voriconazole only) after the first dose would be 1.51, 1.41, 1.28, and 1.14, respectively. This suggests that the remaining systemic fluconazole would result in a marked drug interaction with voriconazole for _ 24 h. Although no safety issues were observed during coadministration, concomitant use of fluconazole and voriconazole is not recommended. Frequent monitoring for voriconazole-related adverse events is advisable if voriconazole is used sequentially after fluconazole.","MATERIALS AND METHODS

if they were male, were aged 21 to 55 years, had a body mass index of 18 to 30
kg/m2, and had a normal resting 12-lead electrocardiogram. Subjects were excluded
if they had any clinically significant disease, allergy, or abnormality; were
taking or had taken any prescribed or over-the-counter medication (except acetaminophen)
within 3 weeks of starting the study; had received any experimental
drug within 4 months of starting the study; had evidence of drug abuse or
excessive use of alcohol or tobacco; had donated blood within the previous 8
weeks; had positive human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis
C virus serology; or had known hypersensitivity to azoles. All subjects gave their
written informed consent prior to their participation.
The study was divided into two treatments, a 4-day period of voriconazole-only
treatment and a 5-day period of voriconazole-plus-fluconazole combination
treatment, separated by a 14-day washout phase. The order in which subjects
underwent these two treatments was assigned randomly. All treatments were
administered orally in a fasted state. Voriconazole was given as a loading dose of
400 mg orally twice daily (every 12 h) on day 1, followed by 200 mg every 12 h
on days 2 and 3 and a single 200-mg dose on day 4. Fluconazole was administered
as a single loading dose of 400 mg orally on day 1, followed by single doses of 200
mg every 24 h on days 2 to 5. Water (240 ml) was used for the administration of
both agents. During the combination treatment phase, fluconazole was administered
immediately after the voriconazole dose.
A blood sample was taken at the screening visit to determine the CYP2C19
genotype status of each subject using previously validated methods (33); the
testing was conducted by Genaissance Pharmaceuticals, Morrisville, NC. All
adverse events and their likely relationship to treatment were recorded throughout
the study period. Physical examination, laboratory safety tests, vital signs, and
12-lead electrocardiogram measurements were used to evaluate safety.
Voriconazole pharmacokinetics. Serial plasma samples for voriconazole pharmacokinetics
were collected predosing and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, and
48 h after dosing on day 4. Plasma samples were assayed for voriconazole by a
previously validated method using automated solid-phase extraction, followed by
liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric analysis (1). The lower and
upper limits of quantification were 10 and 3,000 ng/ml, respectively.
Voriconazole pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental
analyses. Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time to first
occurrence of Cmax (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve
between 0 and 12 h (AUC12), area under the plasma concentration-time curve
from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUCt), and
area under the curve to infinity (AUCinf) were determined on day 4 of each
treatment period. Cmax and Tmax were obtained directly from recorded data, and
AUC12 and AUCt were calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. AUCinf was
calculated using the equation AUCt   (Ct*/kel), where Ct* was the last measurable
concentration and kel was the apparent terminal-elimination-phase rate
constant. All pharmacokinetic parameter values were calculated using
WinNonlin Professional (version 3.2) software (Pharsight, Sunnyvale, CA).
Statistical analyses. Pharmacokinetic parameters for voriconazole calculated
on day 4 of each treatment period were used as endpoints for the statistical
analysis. AUCinf, AUCt, AUC12, and Cmax were subjected to analysis of variance
appropriate for the two-period, two-treatment crossover design. Tmax was summarized
descriptively. Parameters were calculated as mean values with 90%
confidence intervals (CIs), ranges, and coefficients of variation (CVs). Each
parameter was calculated separately for subjects found to be extensive metabolizers
(EMs) or poor metabolizers (PMs) of voriconazole and was compared
between voriconazole alone and the voriconazole-plus-fluconazole combination.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 8.02) software (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Pharmacokinetic (Simcyp) modeling and simulations. PBPK modeling and
simulations of drug interaction were performed using Simcyp (Simcyp population-
based absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination [ADME] simulator,
version 9.03; Simcyp Ltd., Sheffield, United Kingdom). A Simcyp model
for voriconazole was developed using the physicochemical properties, in vitro
data, and clinical pharmacokinetic parameters obtained mainly from the inhouse
database (Table 1). The recombinant enzyme kinetics inputs (maximum
reaction velocity [Vmax] and Michaelis-Menten constant [Km]) were means of the
values from multiple sources that included in-house data (Pfizer, data on file)
and data from published literature (3, 9).
For fluconazole, standard inputs available within Simcyp were utilized. The
inhibition constant (Ki) of fluconazole for the CYP2C19 enzyme used for simulating
drug-drug interaction was 2.1  M (31). The literature reports Ki values for
fluconazole-mediated CYP3A4 inhibition ranging from 1.9 to 63  M; therefore,
a mean value of 25.2  M was used as the input for Simcyp modeling (4, 8, 10,
31, 34).
Each simulation was performed for 100 subjects (10 trials   10 subjects). The
virtual population had a body weight of 70 kg, with ages ranging from 18 to 65
years, and included both sexes. The dose, dosing interval, and dosing duration of
voriconazole and fluconazole in the simulation were identical to those used in the
clinical study. Accordingly, voriconazole alone was dosed every 12 h for 4 days
(first two doses of 400 mg and subsequent five doses of 200 mg each), or
voriconazole was coadministered with fluconazole (first fluconazole dose of 400
mg and subsequent doses of 200 mg each every 24 h). For simulating sequential
dosing, fluconazole dosing remained the same, while voriconazole administration
was initiated at times of 6, 12, and 24 h following the last dose of fluconazole.",DDI Randomized clinical trials
23876492,Clinical and pharmacogenetic predictors of circulating atorvastatin and rosuvastatin concentrations in routine clinical care.,"A barrier to statin therapy is myopathy associated with elevated systemic drug exposure. Our objective was to examine the association between clinical and pharmacogenetic variables and statin concentrations in patients. In total, 299 patients taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin were prospectively recruited at an outpatient referral center. The contribution of clinical variables and transporter gene polymorphisms to statin concentration was assessed using multiple linear regression. We observed 45-fold variation in statin concentration among patients taking the same dose. After adjustment for sex, age, bo+C11dy mass index, ethnicity, dose, and time from last dose, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (P<0.001) and ABCG2 c.421C>A (P<0.01) were important to rosuvastatin concentration (adjusted R(2)=0.56 for the final model). Atorvastatin concentration was associated with SLCO1B1 c.388A>G (P<0.01) and c.521T>C (P<0.05) and 4_-hydroxycholesterol, a CYP3A activity marker (adjusted R(2)=0.47). A second cohort of 579 patients from primary and specialty care databases were retrospectively genotyped. In this cohort, genotypes associated with statin concentration were not differently distributed among dosing groups, implying providers had not yet optimized each patient's risk-benefit ratio. Nearly 50% of patients in routine practice taking the highest doses were predicted to have statin concentrations greater than the 90th percentile. Interindividual variability in statin exposure in patients is associated with uptake and efflux transporter polymorphisms. An algorithm incorporating genomic and clinical variables to avoid high atorvastatin and rosuvastatin levels is described; further study will determine whether this approach reduces incidence of statin myopathy.","Methods
Study population
We prospectively invited adult outpatients at London Health Sciences Center (LHSC,
London, Canada) taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin daily to participate. Patients were
excluded if they were taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin in an alternate day dosing regimen,
or if they had not taken their last atorvastatin or rosuvastatin dose within 24 hours of their
clinic visit and blood draw. All patients had been taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin at the
same dose for at least six weeks prior to participation, with the exception of one patient who
had been switched from 40 mg to 80 mg one week prior to blood sampling to achieve better
cholesterol lowering. The study was conducted between August 2009 and May 2011. A
detailed medical history was obtained, and the time of the last oral statin dose in relation to
plasma level measurement was recorded. Ethnicity was self-reported. LDL-C response was
defined by attainment of LDL-C target values according to the 2009 Canadian Lipid
Guidelines1 and by the clinical judgment of the treating physician. All subjects provided

written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board of
the University of Western Ontario (London, Canada).
Sample collection
A single venous 8 mL blood sample was drawn into EDTA-containing tubes, and placed
immediately on ice. Samples were centrifuged 2,000 _ g for 10 minutes; plasma was
collected and stored at _80 çC until further analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood
samples using the Gentra Puregene extraction kit (Qiagen, Alameda, CA, USA).
Retrospective statin dosing analysis
We retrospectively examined genotype, clinical variables, and statin dose in a separate
cohort comprised of outpatients from LHSC and Vanderbilt University Medical Center
(BioVU, Nashville, Tennessee).
BioVU
BioVU at Vanderbilt University is a large collection of DNA samples linked to a
comprehensive EMR10. BioVU is a dynamic clinical practice-based cohort, nested within an
even larger database containing a secure, de-identified copy of the entire EMR utilized by
Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Referred to as the Synthetic Derivative (SD), this
practice-derived database incorporates clinical information from multiple sources, including
diagnostic and procedural codes, as well as provider progress notes, hospital admissions,
discharge summaries, clinical laboratory data, and medication data.
Determination of plasma statin concentration
All chemical and deuterated standards were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals
(North York, Canada). Plasma aliquots of 100 _L were precipitated in 300 _L acetonitrile
containing internal standard d5-atorvastatin or d6-rosuvastatin, and centrifuged at 14,000
rpm for 20 minutes at 4 çC. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 in 0.05% formic acid. Analytes
were separated using mobile phases 0.05% formic acid in water and 0.05% formic acid in
acetonitrile, starting at a ratio of 70:30, with a gradient to ratio of 10:90. Concentrations of
rosuvastatin and atorvastatin were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LCMS) instrumentation and transitions as previously described 11.
Determination of lathosterol and 4_-hydroxycholesterol concentrations
Sterol concentrations were measured according to published methods for LCMS 12-13.
Lathosterol, 4_-hydroxycholesterol, and 4_-hydroxycholesterol-d7 were obtained from
Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, Alabama), and lathosterol-d4 was obtained from CDN
Isotopes (Pointe-Claire, Canada). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Standard curves ranging from 0-50 _g/mL lathosterol were prepared in 1%
fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of 50 _L of
plasma or standard curve were saponified in 1 mL of 1M KOH in ethanol for 1 hour at 37
çC. The samples were extracted twice, in 750 _L of hexanes each time. After evaporation at
80 çC to dryness, a mixture of the following derivatization reagents was added to each
sample: 15 mg 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic anhydride, 4.5 mg 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 12 mg
picolinic acid, 225 _L pyridine, and 30 _L triethylamine. Samples were incubated with the
derivatization reagents at 80 çC for 1 hour, extracted in 1 mL of hexanes, and evaporated at
80 çC to dryness. Samples were reconstituted in 20 _L 0.9% NaCl and 80 _L water; 20 _L
of sample was injected on an Eclipse Plus C18 column (1.8 _m pore size; 2.1 _ 100 mm;
Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, Canada) attached to an Agilent 1290 Infinity ultra high
pressure liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies) coupled with a TSQ
Quantum triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Analytes were separated

and eluted with a gradient from 80% to 98% methanol:acetonitrile (1:1). The transition used
for lathosterol was m/z 555.3 to 513.8. The transition used for 4_-hydroxycholesterol was m/
z 635.4 to 146.5. Interday variability was less than 25% for lathosterol and less than 30% for
4_-hydroxycholesterol, at relevant concentrations.
Determination of total cholesterol
Total cholesterol was measured by the enzymatic colorimetric method, using the Cholesterol
E kit from Wako (Richmond, VA). Samples were measured in triplicate using the microplate
procedure, according to manufacturer's directions.
Genotyping
We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allelic frequency
greater than 10% in genes encoding drug transporters for which statins are known substrates,
and genotyped SNPs that have been demonstrated to have a functional effect on one or more
substrates in vivo. Genotype was determined by TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) for uptake transporter polymorphisms SLCO1B1 c.388A>G (rs2306283);
SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (rs4149056); SLCO1B3 c.699G>A (rs7311358); SLCO2B1 c.935G>A
(rs12422149), and efflux transporter polymorphisms ABCB1 c.3435C>T (rs1045642);
ABCC2 c.1249G>A (rs2273697); and ABCG2 c.421C>A (rs2231142). For the atorvastatin
group, polymorphisms in the drug metabolizing enzymes CYP3A4 (rs35599367) and
CYP3A5 (rs776746) were also assessed. Patients in the rosuvastatin group were also
genotyped for CYP2C9 *2 (rs1799853) and CYP2C9 *3 (rs1057910). The SNPs assessed in
the present study are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Missing genotypes ranged from
0% to 0.7%, depending on the polymorphism. We repeated genotyping of 10% of the
samples; 100% of replicated genotypes were concordant. Haplotypes were determined using
the haplo.stats library in R using an indirect design matrix and linear regression was
conducted by comparing alternative haplotypes to the reference haplotype SLCO1B1 c.
388A-c521T.
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the Chi-square method of the genetics
package of R. All genotypes tested were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with the exception
of ABCB1 c.3435C>T (p = 0.010) and SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (p = 0.041). Genotypes
associated with statin concentration were not differently distributed between Caucasians and
other ethnicities in our patient cohort, by Chi-square test.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software R14 and GraphPad Prism 5
(La Jolla, CA). Differences in statin concentration with respect to each dose group were
assessed by Tukey's multiple comparisons tests. We defined the explainable variability as
the variability attributed to characteristics other than dose and time from last dose. We
calculated this by totaling the sum of squares for each final model and assessing the
proportion contributed by the genetic variables.
For log-transformed rosuvastatin concentration, the effect sizes detectable with a power of
0.80 or higher are 0.141, 0.145 and 0.187 for SLCO1B1 c.521T>C, SLCO1B1 c.388A>G,
and ABCG2 c.421C>A, respectively. For log-transformed atorvastatin concentration, the
effect sizes detectable with a power of 0.80 or higher are 0.274, 0.223 and 0.324 for
SLCO1B1 c.521T>C, SLCO1B1 c.388A>G, and ABCG2 c.421C>A, respectively.

Multiple linear regression analysis
Statin concentration was log-transformed to adjust for right-skew. Only those patients with
blood sampling times after the tmax of the statin were included (1.5 hours and 4.0 hours for
atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, respectively11). Different genetic models_dominant, codominant,
recessive, and additive models_were considered for each transporter
polymorphism and the model that best described the fit with log-transformed statin
concentration or lathosterol concentration was chosen. Each polymorphism was assessed for
association with log statin concentration with a cut-off p-value of 0.20 for further inclusion
in the multiple linear regression model. SLCO1B1 c.521T>C and c.388A>G, and ABCG2 c.
421C>A, were included in the model as additive models. In the additive model, homozygous
wildtype genotypes were coded as 0, heterozygous genotypes were coded as 1, and
homozygous variant genotypes were coded as 2. Regression analysis was performed by a
step-wise search. All models were adjusted for the demographic and dosing variables age,
gender, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, statin dose, and hours from last dose. Of these
variables, age, dose, and time from last dose were statistically significant. Next, the number
of concomitant medications or presence of the specific medications ezetimibe, niacin, and
fibrate were assessed for their contribution to the model and retained if p < 0.20. 4_-
hydroxycholesterol values and transporter and drug metabolizing enzyme genotypes were
similarly introduced into the model. In the final model, only those variables with p < 0.05
were retained, with the exception of the demographic and dosing variables listed above.
Dosing algorithm
Maximum doses predicted to result in statin concentrations less than the 90th percentile were
calculated based on our linear regression models. The 90th percentile was determined by
adjusting the atorvastatin or rosuvastatin concentrations measured in our population to the
concentration predicted at the average time of the blood sampling across the population
(11.5 hours for atorvastatin and 12.9 hours for rosuvastatin). For covariates that were not
significant in the model, we substituted the average population value: predicted
concentration was calculated for a hypothetical Caucasian patient of our average population
height and weight (body mass index of 29.0 kg/m2 for atorvastatin and 30.1 kg/m2
rosuvastatin), and for atorvastatin, average 4_-hydroxycholesterol concentration (22 ng/ml).

18408565,The effect of SLCO1B1*15 on the disposition of pravastatin and pitavastatin is substrate dependent: the contribution of transporting activity changes by SLCO1B1*15.,"This study was addressed to understand the underlying mechanism of the substrate-dependent effect of genetic variation in SLCO1B1, which encodes OATP1B1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide) transporter, on the disposition of two OATP1B1 substrates, pravastatin and pitavastatin, in relation to their transport activities. The uptake of pravastatin, pitavastatin, and fluvastatin was measured in oocytes overexpressing SLCO1B1*1a and SLCO1B1*15 to compare the alterations of in-vitro transporting activity. After 40-mg pravastatin or 4-mg pitavastatin was administered to 11 healthy volunteers with homozygous genotypes of SLCO1B1*1a/*1a and SLCO1B1*15/*15, the pharmacokinetic parameters of pravastatin and pitavastatin were compared among participants with SLCO1B1*1a/*1a and SLCO1B1*15/*15 genotypes. The uptake of pravastatin and pitavastatin in SLCO1B1*15 overexpressing oocytes was decreased compared with that in SLCO1B1*15, but no change occurred with fluvastatin. The fold change of in-vitro intrinsic clearance (Clint) for pitavastatin in SLCO1B1*15 compared with SLCO1B1*1a was larger than that of pravastatin (P<0.0001). The clearance (Cl/F) of pitavastatin was decreased to a greater degree in participant with SLCO1B1*15/*15 compared with that of pravastatin in vivo (P<0.01), consistent with in-vitro study. As a result, Cmax and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of these nonmetabolized substrates were increased by SLCO1B1*15 variant. The greater decrease in the transport activity for pitavastatin in SLCO1B1*15 variant compared with SLCO1B1*1a was, however, associated with the greater effect on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin compared with pravastatin in relation to the SLCO1B1 genetic polymorphism. This study suggests that substrate dependency in the consequences of the SLCO1B1*15 variant could modulate the effect of SLCO1B1 polymorphism on the disposition of pitavastatin and pravastatin.","Materials and methods
Materials
Pravastatin was obtained from Sigma_Aldrich Chemical
Co. (St Louis, Missouri, USA). Pitavastatin and fluvastatin
was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals
(North York, Ontario, Canada).
Site-directed mutagenesis
To generate SLCO1B1*15 containing both the c.388A>G
and c.521T>C mutations, a two-step site-directed
mutagenesis was performed using pcDNA3.1-SLCO1B1
(gift from Dr Akira Tsuji, Kanazawa University,
Kanazawa, Japan) as a template. The Quick Change
site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla,
California, USA) was used to introduce point mutations
according to the manufacturerês protocol. The mutations
and the fidelity of the remaining DNA were confirmed
by sequencing. The oligonucleotides used for sitedirected
mutagenesis of the SLCO1B1 gene were
as follows: c.388A>G, 50-GAAACTAATATCGATTC
ATCAGAAAATTC-30 (forward) and 50-GAATTTTCTG
ATGAATCGATATTAGTTTC-30 (reverse); c.521T>C,

and 50-TACCCATGAACGCATATATCCACATG-30 (reverse).
cRNA synthesis and in-vitro uptake study
cRNA synthesis and uptake measurements were performed
as described previously [20]. Capped cRNA was
synthesized in vitro using the T7 RNA polymerase Kit
(Ambion Inc., Austin, Texas, USA) from plasmid DNAs
linearized with Not I. Defolliculated oocytes were
injected with capped cRNA (25 ng) and incubated at
181C in Barthês solution (88 mmol/l NaCl, 1 mmol/l KCl,
0.33mmol/l Ca(NO3)2, 0.4mmol/l CaCl2, 0.8 mmol/l
MgSO4, 2.4mmol/l NaHCO3, 10mmol/l N-2-hydroxyl
piperazine-N0-2-ethane sulfonic acid), containing 50 mg/
ml gentamicin. After 2 days of incubation, uptake
experiments were performed at room temperature in
ND96 solution (96mmol/l NaCl, 2mmol/l KCl, 1.8mmol/l
CaCl2, 1mmol/l MgCl2, 5mmol/l N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-
N0-2-ethane sulfonic acid, pH 7.4). The uptake reaction
was initiated by replacing ND96 solution with that
containing various concentrations (1_100 mmol/l) of pravastatin,
pitavastatin, fluvastatin, or 40 nmol/l [3H]
estrone-3-sulfate, as a positive control, and quenched by
the addition of ice-cold ND96 solution with washing
five times.

Participants
All participants provided written informed consent
before participating in the study. The study protocol
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Inje
University Busan Paik Hospital, Busan, Korea.
In total, 494 unrelated Korean participants had been
genotyped for the SLCO1B1 variants c.388A>G
(Asn130Asp) and c.521T>C (Val174Ala). Of these, 11
healthy male participants according to their clinical
laboratory test were enrolled in this trial and assigned
to two groups according to the genotype. The genotype of
one group (six participants) was SLCO1B1*1a/*1a, which
is wild-type SLCO1B1 and the demographic parameters
of the participants such as age, height, body weight,
and body mass index (mean±SD) were 20.7±0.8 years,
176.8±4.2 cm, 69.8±8.2 kg, and 22.3±2.0 kg/cm2,
respectively. The genotype of the other group (five
participants) was SLCO1B1*15/*15, a homozygous mutant
with c.388A>G and c.521T>C and the demographic
parameters of the participants such as age, height, body
weight, and body mass index (mean±SD) were 20.6±
0.9 years, 171.0±8.2 cm, 69.6±9.4 kg, and 24.0±1.7 kg/
cm2, respectively. No statistical difference between two
groups was observed (P>0.05). The participants were
not allowed to take any drugs, use alcohol or caffeine, or
drink any fruit juice during the study period.
SLCO1B1 genotyping
To determine the presence or absence of mutations at
the sites c.388A>G and c.521T>C, genomic DNA was
amplified by PCR, followed by pyrosequencing analysis
(PSQ 96MA System with dedicated SQA Software
and SQA Reagent Kits; Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). The
sequences of the forward and reverse PCR primers used
were: 50-biotin-GCAAATAAAGGGGAATATTTCTC-30 and
50-AGAGATGTAATTAAATGTATAC-30, respectively, for
c.388A>G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and
50-biotin-CCCAGTCTCAGGTATGTATT-30 and 50-TGT
AAGAAAGCCCCAATGGTA-30, respectively, for c.521T>C
SNP.
Biotinylated PCR products were immobilized on streptavidin-
coated beads (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala,
Sweden) and followed by strand separation and sample
preparation, using a PSQ 96 sample preparation kit
(Pyrosequencing; Amersham Biosciences). The sequencing
primer was annealed at 80_901C for 3min. The SNPs
were analyzed using a PSQ 96 system with a SNP reagent
kit. The sequencing primers were 50-GATGTTGAA
TTTTCTGATGA-30 and 50-CGAAGCATATTACCCAT-30
for the c.388A>G and c.521T>C SNPs, respectively.
Study design
All participants took part in the randomized two-phase
crossover study, with a 1-week washout period between
each administration. Each participant received a single
oral dose of 40-mg pravastatin (Mevalotin; Sankyo, Tokyo,
Japan) or a single oral dose of 4-mg pitavastatin (Livalo;
Choongwae Pharm Co., Seoul, Korea) with 240ml of
water after an overnight fast. Food was allowed 4 h after
drug administration. Blood samples were drawn immediately
before and at 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
24, and 48 h after drug administration. Blood samples
were centrifuged and the separated plasma samples were
stored at _ 801C until analyzed.
Determination of pravastatin and pitavastatin
concentration
For the determination of statins after the uptake study,
oocytes were sonicated with 50 ml of distilled water and
50 ml internal standard (fluvastatin for the analysis of
pravastatin and pitavastatin, pravastatin for the analysis
of fluvastatin, 25 ng/ml in acetonitrile). After sonication,
the supernatant of the mixture was evaporated and the
residue was reconstituted in 100 ml of mobile phase
(acetonitrile : distilled water : formic acid=90 : 10 : 0.1,
v/v). After centrifugation (14 000 rpm, 3 min), an aliquot
(5 ml) of the reconstituted sample was injected into an
API 3000 LC/MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, California, USA) in the multiple reaction monitoring
mode (m/z 423/101 for pravastatin, m/z 420/290 for
pitavastatin, and m/z 410/348 for fluvastatin). The retention
times of pravastatin, pitavastatin, and fluvastatin
were 0.9, 0.9, and 1.0 min, respectively, with a total
analysis time of 5 min. A mobile phase was used at a flow
rate of 0.2 ml/min through a Luna C18 (2 50 mm, 3 mm;
Phenomenex, Torrance, California, USA). The lower limit
of quantification is 0.5 ng/ml. The assay precision was less
than 13.4% and the accuracy of this assay was within the
range of 94.5_107.3%.
Plasma concentrations of pravastatin and pitavastatin
were also determined using a LC/MS/MS system and a
solid-phase extraction method was applied for sample
preparation. Briefly, plasma samples (0.5 ml) were spiked
with an internal standard (20 ml of 25 ng/ml fluvastatin).
The sample mixture was loaded on to the conditioned
solid-phase extraction cartridge (C18 Cartridges,
Sep-Pak; Waters, Milford, Massachusetts, USA) and then
washed with 1ml of deionized water. The cartridge was
then eluted with 1ml of methanol. The eluent was dried,
then reconstituted with 100 ml of mobile phase, and an
aliquot (5 ml) of the supernatant was injected to the
LC/MS/MS system. Lower limit of quantification was
1 ng/ml for all analytes. The coefficient of variation of
the assay precision was less than 12.4% and the accuracy
exceeded 89%.
Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses
To estimate kinetic parameters for the uptake of
pravastatin, pitavastatin, and fluvastatin in oocytes
expressing SLCO1B1*1a and SLCO1B1*15, the
426 Pharmacogenetics and Genomics 2008, Vol 18 No 5
OATP1B1-mediated transport rate was obtained by
subtracting the transport rate of water-injected oocytes
from that of SLCO1B1-cRNA-injected oocytes. The
transport rate of pravastatin, pitavastatin, and fluvastatin
was plotted against the initial concentration of these
substrates, and the resulting profile was fitted to a
Michaelis_Menten equation, to estimate kinetic parameters,
such as Vmax and Km. The Clint for each substrate
was obtained from Vmax/Km. A weighted, nonlinear
regression analysis was performed using WinNonlin
(version 5.1; Pharsight, Mountain View, California, USA).
Pharmacokinetic parameters of pravastatin and pitavastatin
were calculated by noncompartmental analysis using
WinNonlin. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) values
and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were estimated directly
from the observed plasma concentration_time profile.
The elimination rate constant (Ke) was estimated from
the least-squares regression slope of terminal plasma
concentrations. The AUC was calculated according to the
linear trapezoidal rule and extrapolation to infinity by
calculating AUClast-N=Clast/Ke, where Clast was the last
plasma concentration after drug administration. The oral
clearance of pravastatin and pitavastatin (Cl/F) was
calculated as Cl/F=dose/AUC and the volume of
distribution (Vd/F) was calculated as Vd=F _ Dose
Ke AUC :
On the basis of present results on the pharmacokinetics
of pravastatin and pitavastatin, a sample size of five and
six participants, respectively, in each genotype group was
desired to detect a 100% larger AUC of pravastatin and
pitavastatin in participants with SLCO1B1*15/*15 genotype
than in participants with SLCO1B1*1a/*1a genotype
with a power of at least 80% (a-level 5%).
The fold changes in the kinetic parameters in in-vitro
uptake study and in-vivo pharmacokinetics study
was calculated by dividing the kinetic parameter values
in oocytes overexpressing SLCO1B1*15 and human
SLCO1B1*15/*15 volunteers by the mean values of the
respective parameters in SLCO1B1*1a expressing oocytes
and human volunteers with SLCO1B1*1a/*1a, respectively.
All pharmacokinetic data are given as the mean±SD.
The statistical differences between various group parameters
were determined with the nonparametric Mann_
Whitney test because of the limited sample size and were
deemed to be statistically significant at P<0.05.",Genotyped PK Trial
12603176,"Investigation of the mutual pharmacokinetic interactions between bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, and simvastatin.","In vitro, bosentan has been shown to be a mild inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and 3A4. To investigate in vivo the mutual pharmacokinetic interactions between bosentan and simvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Nine healthy male subjects were treated in a three-period randomised crossover study with: (A) bosentan 125 mg twice daily for 5.5 days; (B) simvastatin 40 mg once daily for 6 days; and (C) bosentan 125 mg twice daily and simvastatin 40 mg once daily for 5.5 and 6 days, respectively. Plasma concentration-time profiles of bosentan and its metabolites (treatments A and C) and simvastatin and beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin (treatments B and C) were determined on day 6. Steady-state conditions for bosentan and its metabolites were attained on day 4 of treatment. The pharmacokinetic parameters of bosentan and its metabolites were not influenced by concomitant treatment with simvastatin: areas under the plasma concentration-time curve over one administration interval of 12 hours (AUC(tau)) [geometric mean and 95% CI] were 4586 (3719-5656) and 4928 (3945-6156) micro g * h/L. In contrast, bosentan significantly reduced exposure to simvastatin and beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin by 34 and 46%, respectively. AUC(tau) values for simvastatin were 30.5 (23.1-40.2) and 20.0 (15.9-25.1) micro g * h/L and for beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin 43.0 (32.1-57.8) and 23.4 (16.7-32.6) micro g * h/L in treatments B and C, respectively. Concomitant treatment with bosentan reduces the exposure to simvastatin and beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin by approximately 40%, indicating that in vivo bosentan is also a mild inducer of CYP3A4.","Subjects and Methods

participate in this study. All subjects were male
Caucasians in the age range 24 45 years. An
Ethics Committee (Landes_rztekammer Baden-
Wu rttemberg, Stuttgart, Germany) approved the
study protocol and all subjects gave written informed
consent before any screening procedures
were performed. The study was conducted in full
conformity with the principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki and its amendments. Subjects were assessed
to be healthy on the basis of a medical
screen, which included physical examination, recording
of medical history, measurement of vital
signs (including ECG), and conduct of clinical laboratory
tests (haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis,
drug screen) within 3 weeks prior to first
drug administration. During the study, no concomitant
medication was allowed with the exception of
medications to treat adverse events. Restrictions
were applied regarding the intake of methylxanthine-
containing beverages as well as the con-

sumption of grapefruit juice. The subjects were
hospitalised from approximately 12 hours before
until 12 hours after drug intake on day 6 of each
treatment period. An end-of-study examination
was performed 2_4 days after the last drug administration
in the third period.
Design
This was a single-centre, open-label, randomised,
three-way crossover study in which subjects
were treated with: (A) bosentan 125mg twice
daily for 5.5 days; (B) simvastatin 40mg (ZocorÂ,
Merck & Co.) once daily for 6 days; and (C)
bosentan 125mg twice daily and simvastatin 40mg
once daily for 5.5 and 6 days, respectively. Three
different treatment sequences were employed. The
washout period between the separate treatments
was 2 weeks. Drug was administered at 12-hour
intervals in the morning and the evening following
consumption of breakfast and dinner, respectively.
On day 6, no food was allowed until 4 hours after
drug intake.On days 1_5, subjects came to the
clinic for drug administration and withdrawal of
morning trough blood samples.
Assessments
Blood samples of 4.5ml (treatments A and B)
or 10ml (treatment C) were collected into EDTAcontaining
tubes from an indwelling catheter in an
antecubital vein just before and at 15, 30, 45 and
60 minutes and 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10
and 12 hours after administration of study drug in
the morning of day 6. On study days 1_5, a blood
sample was collected just before administration of
the morning dose. Plasma was separated and stored
at _20 çC pending analysis. After solid phase extraction,
plasma concentrations of bosentan and its
three metabolites (Ro 47-8634, Ro 48-5033 and Ro
64-1056) were determined with a slightly modified
liquid chromatography assay method with tandem
mass spectrometry detection, details of which have
been provided previously.[21] The limit of quantification
was 1 _g/L for bosentan and 2 _g/L for
each of the three metabolites. Imprecision of the
assay was up to 7.7% for bosentan and its metabolites
and inaccuracy was <8.0%. Plasma concentrations

vastatin were determined by a validated liquid
chromatography method. The detection system
consisted of tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray
ionisation (ESI) working in the combined
ESI(_)/ESI(+) mode and multiple reaction monitoring
of indicative precursor/product ion pairs
of simvastatin and _-hydroxyacid simvastatin.
Lovastatin and _-hydroxyacid lovastatin were
used as internal standards. The limit of quantification
was 0.2 _g/L for simvastatin and 0.1 _g/L for
_-hydroxyacid simvastatin. Imprecision of the assay
was up to 7.7% for (_-hydroxyacid) simvastatin
and inaccuracy was < 7.0%. Vital signs (systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate)
were measured at several time points after drug
intake with subjects in a sitting position. All adverse
events reported during the study were recorded
and rated as mild, moderate or severe.
Evaluation
The pharmacokinetic evaluation for bosentan
and its metabolites as well as for simvastatin and
_-hydroxyacid simvastatin was performed with
model-independent methods.[22] The peak plasma
concentration (Cmax) and the time to Cmax (tmax)
were read directly from the concentration-time
data. Area under the plasma concentration-time
curve over one administration interval of 12 hours
(AUC_) was estimated with use of the linear trapezoidal
rule. The terminal elimination rate constant
_z of simvastatin and _-hydroxyacid simvastatin
was determined by log-linear regression analysis
of the terminal phase. The elimination half-life t1_2z
was calculated by dividing ln 2 by _z. The pharmacokinetic
parameters of the different analytes
were descriptively presented as geometric means
with 95% CIs. The pharmacokinetic parameters of
the treatments were compared by analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with the factors treatment, period,
sequence, and subject (sequence). For this purpose,
Cmax and AUC values were first log-transformed.
The values of tmax were statistically compared with
the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. A level of p < 0.05
was considered as statistically significant.
Safety data were evaluated descriptively. Vital
signs were screened for values outside prespecified
ranges, defined as 100_160mm Hg for systolic
blood pressure, 45_100mm Hg for diastolic blood
pressure and 45_100 beats per minute for pulse
rate. Clinical laboratory values were compared
with the normal range supplied by the analysing

20081064,An evaluation of the early pharmacodynamic response after simultaneous initiation of warfarin and amiodarone.,"Amiodarone inhibits the metabolism of warfarin. Previous studies characterizing this drug interaction have focused on the effect of adding amiodarone to stable doses of warfarin. The objective of this study was to assess whether simultaneous initiation of warfarin and amiodarone results in early alteration of the international normalized ratio (INR) response to warfarin. Patients initiated on warfarin and amiodarone during the same hospitalization were included in the amiodarone (AMIO) group. Patients initiated on warfarin alone (n = 42) were identified for the CONTROL group. The AMIO and CONTROL groups were matched based on age, gender, and ejection fraction <40% using propensity score matching (final n = 18 patients per group). Total and average daily warfarin dose was lower in the AMIO group, yet INR values were similar on each day between the 2 groups. More patients in the AMIO group had an INR greater than 2 during the 5-day observation period as compared to the CONTROL group. In addition, there were trends toward greater deviation from INR values expected with a 5-mg daily warfarin dose among AMIO group patients. Simultaneous initiation of warfarin and amiodarone leads to an enhanced pharmacodynamic response to warfarin early in therapy. Although these data should be viewed as hypothesis generating, cautious dosing and monitoring with simultaneous initiation of warfarin and amiodarone may be warranted.","on age, gender,

on an initial 5-mg dose of warfarin, this nomogram
helps characterize a patient's pharmacodynamic
response and provides guidance for dosage adjustments.
Deviation from the nomogram was defined as
an INR greater than 1.5 on day 2 of therapy, an INR
greater than 1.9 on day 3 of therapy, and an INR
greater than 3 on day 4 or 5 of therapy. These INR
limits were defined as a ñdeviationî because exceeding
these INR values suggests that the warfarin dose
should be reduced to less than 5 mg. Rate of deviation

15980690,"Effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin: results of AIDS Clinical Trials Group 5108 Study.","Efavirenz (EFV) is associated with hyperlipidemia when used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. EFV is a mixed inducer/inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isozyme and may interact with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors that are primarily metabolized via CYP3A4. To assess the drug-drug interaction of EFV used in combination with simvastatin (SIM), atorvastatin (ATR), or pravastatin (PRA), an open-label trial was conducted in 52 healthy adult HIV-seronegative subjects across AIDS Clinical Trials Group sites in the United States. Subjects received 40 mg of SIM, 10 mg of ATR, or 40 mg of PRA daily on days 0 through 3 and days 15 through 18. EFV was administered daily at a dose of 600 mg on days 4 through 18. SIM, ATR, and PRA concentrations were determined before and after EFV, and EFV concentrations were determined before and after statins. EFV reduced SIM acid exposure (area under the curve at 0 to 24 hours [AUC0-24 h]) by 58% (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P=0.003) and active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity by 60% (P<0.001). EFV reduced ATR exposure by 43% (P<0.001) and the total active ATR exposure by 34% (P=0.005). EFV administration resulted in a 40% decrease in PRA exposure (P=0.005). SIM, ATR, and PRA had no effect on non-steady-state EFV concentrations. In conclusion, EFV, when administered with SIM, ATR, or PRA, can result in significant induction of statin metabolism. The reduced inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity during coadministration of EFV may result in diminished antilipid efficacy at usual doses of SIM, ATR, and PRA.","METHODS
AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) A5108 was a phase 1
open-label study examining the effect of EFV on the pharmacokinetics
of SIM, atorvastatin (ATR), and pravastatin (PRA).
The study was performed in healthy adult HIV-seronegative
volunteers to avoid potential confounders from comorbidities
and HIV management medications and to avoid the development
of antiretroviral drug resistance. The primary objective
was to examine the effect of EFV on the pharmacokinetics of
statins. Secondary objectives were to investigate the effect of
statins on the non_steady-state pharmacokinetics of EFV and
non_steady-state changes in serum low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol secondary to statins.
Subjects
Subjects were accrued into the 3 study arms between
November 2001 and May 2002. Subjects had no underlying
illnesses, were not taking chronic medications, and had baseline
laboratory values within normal limits (fasting triglyceride
levels ,400 mg/dL). Women of reproductive potential were
excluded. Subjects who did not complete the 3 pharmacokinetic
evaluations were replaced to achieve the required sample
size.
Study Design
The study consisted of 3 treatment arms: arm A (40 mg
of SIM daily), arm B (10 mg of ATR daily), and arm C (40 mg
of PRA daily) (Fig. 1). Medications were taken in the evening
as is recommended for EFVand statins. For the first 3 days, the
subjects self-administered statins, and on the fourth day, the
statin was administered under directly observed conditions.
Blood samples were obtained before drug administration as
well as 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after
statin administration for pharmacokinetic assay. After the
24-hour blood draw, the subjects were administered 600 mg
of EFVand were instructed to take 600 mg of EFVat bedtime
for the next 9 days without the statin. The 11th dose of EFV
was administered under directly observed conditions, and samples
were collected over 24 hours as described previously.
Subsequently, subjects resumed statin dosing and were asked
to take EFV and statin together for the next 2 evenings. For
the final day, both drugs were administered under directly
observed conditions and samples were again collected over
24 hours. Adherence to study medications was measured using
pill counts and questionnaires. Subjects were evaluated at each
study visit for adverse events. The protocol required subjects
experiencing any grade 2 or higher signs, symptoms, or laboratory
abnormalities to terminate study drugs. The protocol
was approved by the local institutional review boards of
participating institutions. Informed consent was obtained from
all subjects. The study was approved by the scientific committees
of the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG)
and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
(NIAID) Division of AIDS Clinical Science Review
Committee.
Drug Assays
SIM and SIM acid plasma concentrations were assayed
at Merck and Co. (West Point, PA) using liquid chromatography/
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).15 Quantification
of plasma concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was
also performed using an enzyme inhibition assay. This assay
measures plasma levels of active and total inhibitors, which are
generated by base hydrolysis.16
ATR and 2 active metabolites, 2-hydroxy ATR and
4-hydroxy ATR, were assayed in plasma by turbo ion spray
LC/MS/MS in the positive ion mode at Advion BioSciences,
Inc. (Ithaca, NY).17 Unchanged ATR and total active ATR
(derived from adding concentrations of ATR and the 2 active
metabolites) are presented.
PRA plasma concentrations were analyzed by turbo ion
LC/MS/MS in the positive ion mode at Advion BioSciences,
Inc.18 EFV plasma assays were performed at the University of
Alabama Pharmacology Support Laboratory of the ACTG.19
Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations were measured at local site
laboratories using standard enzymatic assays. Calculated LDL
was determined using the Friedewald equation.
Calculation of Area Under the Curve
Systemic exposure to the statins and EFV was quantified
by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the drugs
before dosing to the end of the dosing interval (0_24 hours).
Concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ)
were assigned a value of LLQ/2. Actual sample times were
used. If the 0-hour concentration was unavailable and the
24-hour concentration was available, an imputed 0-hour concentration
taking the value of the concentration at 24 hours
(C24h) was used, and vice versa. AUCs were estimated according
to the linear trapezoidal rule, without extrapolation
beyond the dosing interval.

Statistical Analysis
The pharmacokinetic parameters tested were AUC,
maximum concentration (Cmax), and minimum concentration
(Cmin). Means, standard deviations (SDs), coefficients of variation
(CVs), and medians and their 95% confidence intervals
(CIs)20 were reported. Median within-subject differences (eg,
day 18 2 day 3) as a percent of the earlier value (eg, day 3)
were also calculated, as were 90% CIs around geometric
means of within-subject ratios (GMRs), for comparison with
no-effect boundaries of 80% to 125% as recommended by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when evaluating
bioequivalence.21,22
To test the null hypothesis of no difference in statin exposure
before versus after initiation of EFV (and in EFV
exposurewith and without statin coadministration), theWilcoxon
signed rank test was applied towithin-subject differences in AUC
and Cmax values. Reported P values are 2-sided and not adjusted
for multiple comparisons.
Fixing type I and II error rates at 5% and 10%, respectively,
assuming within-subject CVs of 37% for SIM and ATR
AUCs and assuming the use of the 2-sided paired t test for
log AUCs, 12 subjects per arm provided 90% power to detect
decreases (increases) of 38% (60%) or larger attributable to
EFV in SIM and ATR AUCs. Assuming a within-subject CV
for PRA AUCs of 31%, a sample size of 12 provided 90%
power to detect a decrease (increase) in PRA AUCs of 33%
(50%) or larger attributable to EFV. To adjust for the lower
efficiency of the Wilcoxon test relative to the paired t test and
to account for missing results, 2 additional subjects per arm
were added, bringing accrual targets to 14 per arm.
Serum lipid levels were obtained under fasting conditions
($8 hours from last ingestion) before dosing on days 0,
3, 15, and 19 (before statin administration and after 4 doses of
statins and before and after EFV initiation). The Kruskal-
Wallis (KW) test was used to compare baseline LDL across
arms. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used (1) to compare
statin-associated LDL changes without EFV (day 4 2 day 0)
and with EFV (day 19 2 day 15) each with the hypothesized
value of 0, (2) to compare statin-associated LDL changes
without EFV (day 4 2 day 0) and with EFV (day 19 2 day 15)
with each other, and (3) to compare the first (day 0) and second
(day 15) LDL baseline values (compare the difference from 0).
No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons.",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
21628604,Valproate reduces the glucuronidation of asenapine without affecting asenapine plasma concentrations.,"Asenapine is indicated for treatment of schizophrenia in the United States and acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes, as monotherapy (United States and European Union) or adjunct therapy (United States only), associated with bipolar I disorder. It is extensively metabolized; the 2 main metabolites are asenapine N-glucuronide and N-desmethyl-asenapine. The authors investigated the pharmacokinetic interactions between asenapine and valproate in an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study. Twenty-four healthy male volunteers received sublingual doses of asenapine 5 mg alone or under steady-state valproate (500 mg bid for 9 days). Blood samples collected until 72 hours postdosing were analyzed for asenapine, N-desmethyl-asenapine, and asenapine N-glucuronide. Compared with asenapine alone, valproate substantially reduced N-glucuronide formation (area under the curve from 0 to infinity [AUC(0-¡)] reduced 7.4-fold, maximum concentration [C(max)] reduced 6.6-fold) and moderately reduced N-desmethyl-asenapine formation (AUC(0-¡) reduced 30%, C(max) unchanged). Coadministration of valproate did not affect asenapine AUC(0-¡) and C(max) (confidence intervals for the ratios of asenapine AUC(0-¡) and C(max) were contained within the predefined 0.80-1.25 acceptance range). Low-dose valproate, although almost completely inhibiting glucuronidation of asenapine, did not affect the pharmacokinetics of asenapine itself, the entity primarily responsible for the pharmacologic effects of the drug.","Methods
General
The study was conducted in accordance with principles
of good clinical practice and was approved by
the appropriate institutional review boards and regulatory
agencies. All participants provided written
informed consent before any screening activity. The
study reported here has been designed and analyzed
as recommended in the US Food and Drug
Administration guidance for industry.19
Participants
Participants were male volunteers, aged 18 to 55
years, with a body mass index of 18 to 30 kg/m2, and
were healthy as confirmed by medical examination,
physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, vital
signs, and electrocardiography. Exclusions could be
based on significant clinical illness, use of any
medication, or positive alcohol or drug abuse tests.
Participants were also to be excluded or withdrawn
if they had bradycardia (heart rate <50 bpm) or
orthostatic hypotension during screening or before
each asenapine dosing. Participants were not
allowed to use any medication, alcohol, or nicotinecontaining
products for the duration of the study.
Design
In this open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover
study, a single 5-mg dose of sublingual asenapine
(Saphris) was administered alone (treatment A) and
on day 7 of a 9-day course of oral valproate 500 mg
bid, 1 hour after the morning dose of valproate
(treatment B). Participants were randomized to
sequence A-B or sequence B-A. There was a washout
period of at least 2 weeks between successive treatment
periods. During the study, participants were
hospitalized for a period of 4 days (3 nights) during
each treatment period. The participants entered the
clinic in the evening prior to placebo dosing and
remained in the clinic until 36 hours after asenapine
dosing. All other assessments were done on an outpatient
basis.
On the day before each asenapine dose (day _1 in
treatment A, day 6 in treatment B), participants
received a placebo treatment identical to the asenapine
treatment to familiarize them with the trial procedures
and with the administration of a sublingual
formulation. Asenapine 5-mg fast-dissolving sublingual
tablets and matching placebo were supplied by
Merck Sharp & Dohme (formerly NV Organon, Oss,
the Netherlands). Valproic acid (valproate; Depakine
enteric) 500-mg oral tablets were provided by the
contract research organization. The 5-mg dose of
asenapine used in this study is within the recommended
therapeutic range (5-10 mg) to treat psychotic
disorders.
Dosing of placebo and asenapine was performed
in the clinical research facility under continuous
medical supervision. The tablet was placed under
the participantÍs tongue, and the participant was
instructed not to swallow or chew the tablet; participants
were not permitted to drink for 2 hours after
sublingual dosing. On each treatment day, participants
were instructed to fast for 10 hours before and 4
hours after dosing. Treatment was administered while
the participant was in a semirecumbent position; this

position was to be maintained for 4 hours after dosing.
Total fluid intake on treatment was required to
be _2 L.
On other study days, they returned for blood sampling
and valproate dosing. Blood samples were
taken as described below. Adverse events, vital
signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory
parameters were monitored throughout the study.
Blood Collection
Blood samples of 7 mL were obtained for the
measurement of plasma concentrations of asenapine,
des-M, and N-gluc. Blood samples were taken
immediately before dosing and at the following time
points postdose: 10, 20, 30, and 45 minutes and 1,
1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours. The
samples were collected by venipuncture or indwelling
catheters into tubes containing sodium heparin
(eg, Venoject) tubes and subsequently processed to
plasma. Plasma samples were frozen and stored at
_20ÁC until analysis.
Sample Analysis
Assay method for asenapine and des-M in plasma.
Analysis of asenapine and des-M was performed by
the Department of Bioanalytics of Essex Pharma
Development GmbH (Waltrop, Germany). After
solid-phase extraction, the samples were analyzed
using a liquid chromatographic (LC) assay with mass
spectrometric (MS) detection. For the LC/MS assay,
an HP1100 high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) system (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto,
California) with a reversed-phase Discovery C8 analytical
column (150 _ 2.1 mm i.d., 5 _m; Supelco
through Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) was
used. The split LC eluate (220 and 280 _L) was introduced
into an API-3000 triple quadrupole MS/MS
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California;
OS: Analyst Software 1.4) with an electrospray ionization
source. The positive ion mode was used for
these analyses with multiple-reaction monitoring
(MRM) transitions of m/z 286.1 _ 229.0 for asenapine,
m/z 272.1 _ 229.1 for des-M, m/z 290.2 _
229.2 for [13C2H3]-asenapine (internal standard), and
m/z 238.1 _ 195.1 for Org 5649 (internal standard).
The lower limit of quantization (LLOQ) was 0.0250 ng/
mL for asenapine and 0.0500 ng/mL for des-M; the
higher limit of quantization (HLOQ) was 20 ng/mL
for asenapine and des-M. Calibration curves prepared
with 8 concentrations ranging from 0.0250 to
20.0 ng/mL for asenapine and 0.0500 to 20.0 ng/mL
for des-M showed good linearity (asenapine, R2 =
0.9954; des-M, R2 = 0.9928). Quality control samples
(0.0750, 0.15, and 1.5 ng/mL for asenapine; 0.150,
1.50, and 15.0 ng/mL for des-M) were prepared to
determine assay precision and accuracy. Precision
(% coefficient of variation) and accuracy (% bias)
were within the predefined criteria of <15%.
Assay method for asenapine N-glucuronide. Analysis
of N-gluc was performed by QPS Groningen, the
Netherlands (formerly Xendo). After solid-phase
extraction, samples were injected into the LC system.
For LC/MS/MS, an HPLC system was used that
consisted of a Series 200 Peltier column oven, a
Series 200 degasser, and 2 Series 200 micropumps
(PerkinElmer Instruments, Munich, Germany). The
LC eluate was introduced directly into an API-4000
triple quadrupole MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems;
OS: Analyst Software 1.4) with an electrospray ionization
source. The positive ion mode was used for
these analyses. The MRM transitions were m/z 463.1
_ 286.2 for N-gluc and m/z 467.2 _ 291.1 for
[13C2H3]-N-gluc (internal standard).
Calibration curves prepared with 8 concentrations
ranging from 0.250 to 50.0 ng/mL showed good
linearity (R2 = 0.9975). Quality control samples
(0.750, 3.00, and 40.0 ng/mL) prepared to determine
assay precision and accuracy indicated that precision
and accuracy were within the predefined criteria
of <15%.
More details on these bioanalytic analyses can be
found in de Boer et al.20
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by subject
and treatment (ie, asenapine with and without
valproate) from the plasma concentrations of asenapine
and its metabolites. The Cmax and the time to its
occurrence (tmax) were calculated from the measured
plasma concentration data. The AUC from the first
to last time point (AUC0-tlast) was calculated by
means of the linear trapezoidal rule. The terminal
elimination rate constant (_z) was defined as __, in
which _ is the slope of the terminal log-linear phase
of the AUC, as determined by linear regression. The
terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) was calculated as
loge2/_z. AUC0-¡ was calculated as AUC0-tlast +
AUCtlast-¡ (the latter defined as Ctlast/_z, in which Ctlast
was the fitted concentration at time tlast using the
regression line from which _z had been calculated).
The percentage of AUC0-¡ obtained by extrapolation
760 ´ J Clin Pharmacol 2012;52:757-765
GERRITS ET AL
was calculated as 100 (AUCtlast-¡/AUC0-¡). The apparent
clearance (CL/f) was calculated as dose/AUC0-¡,
and the apparent volume of distribution (Vz) was
calculated as CL/f/_z.
Statistical Analysis on Pharmacokinetic Data
Drug interaction testing of treatment B (asenapine plus
valproate) as ñtestî versus treatment A (asenapine
alone) as ñreferenceî was performed based on Cmax,
AUC0-tlast, and AUC0-¡ for asenapine and its metabolites.
For Cmax, AUC0-tlast, and AUC0-¡, parametric point
estimates of the true ratio test/reference with 90% and
95% parametric confidence intervals (CIs) derived
from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors
sequence, subject (sequence), period, and treatment on
the loge-transformed values were calculated; these
point estimates were obtained by the ratio of the geometric
least squares means of the test and reference
treatments. Effects were considered statistically significant
if P _ .05 (2-tailed probability). An acceptance
range for drug interaction testing was 0.80 to 1.25. No
drug interaction effect was to be concluded if the 90%
CIs of Cmax, AUC0-tlast, and AUC0-¡ were fully contained
within this acceptance range.
For all other PK parameters, classical hypothesis
testing was performed on the loge-transformed values
using the ANOVA as mentioned above. For tmax,
a nonparametric analysis was used on nontransformed
values. Parametric point estimates of the true
ratio ñtest/referenceî with their 95% CIs derived
from the ANOVA on loge-transformed values were
calculated (obtained by the ratio of the geometric
least squares means of the test and reference treatments).
For tmax, the point estimate of the true difference
ñtest minus referenceî with its nonparametric
95% confidence interval was calculated.
Safety Assessments and Analysis
Safety and tolerability were assessed by terms of
participant-reported adverse events (AEs), routine
laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and
vital signs. Adverse events were collected by spontaneous
reporting and by regular questioning of the
participants using open questions (ie, ñHow do you
feel?î). Vital signs, ECGs, and routine laboratory
safety were assessed at screening, at regular time
points during treatment, and at follow-up.
The safety analysis included all participants who
took _1 dose of study medication and was performed
on all safety data from the in-treatment period,
defined as the time of initial trial medication exposure
to until follow-up. All AEs were recorded using
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA,
version 8) terminology. The incidence of AEs was
calculated and summarized by treatment and system
organ class. For vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory
safety parameters, summary statistics were calculated
by treatment.",DDI Randomized clinical trials
23334403,Almorexant effects on CYP3A4 activity studied by its simultaneous and time-separated administration with simvastatin and atorvastatin.,"To characterise further the previously observed cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) interaction of the dual orexin receptor antagonist almorexant. Pharmacokinetic interactions were investigated (n_=_14 healthy male subjects in two treatment groups) between almorexant at steady-state when administered either concomitantly or 2 h after administration of single doses of simvastatin (40 mg) or atorvastatin (40 mg). Almorexant dose-dependently increased simvastatin exposure (AUC0-¡) when administered concomitantly [geometric mean ratios (90 % CI): 2.5 (2.1, 2.9) (100 mg), 3.9 (3.3, 4.6) (200 mg)], but not Cmax [3.7 (3.0, 4.5) for both doses]. Time-separated administration resulted in relevant reductions of the interaction [AUC0-¡: 1.4 (1.2, 1.7) (100 mg), 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) (200 mg); Cmax: 1.5 (1.3, 1.9) (100 mg), 1.9 (1.6, 2.4) (200 mg)]. Similar results were obtained for hydroxyacid simvastatin. Independent of almorexant dose and relative time of administration, AUC0-¡ and Cmax of atorvastatin increased (ratios ranged from 1.1 to 1.5). AUC0-¡ and Cmax of o-hydroxy atorvastatin decreased dose-independently [AUC0-¡: 0.8 (0.8, 0.9) (100 mg), 0.6 (0.5, 0.6) (200 mg); Cmax: 0.3 (0.3, 0.4) (100 mg), 0.2 (0.2, 0.3) (200 mg)] when atorvastatin was concomitantly administered. Cmax of o-hydroxy atorvastatin slightly decreased (0.8 for both doses) following time-separated administration; AUC0-¡ was unchanged. Whereas almorexant increased simvastatin exposure dose- and relative time of administration-dependently, atorvastatin exposure increased to a smaller extent and irrespective of dose and time. This suggests that the observed interaction of almorexant with simvastatin is mainly caused by intestinal CYP3A4 inhibition, whereas the interaction with atorvastatin is more due to hepatic CYP3A4 inhibition.","Methods
Subjects
A total of 28 male subjects in two treatment groups (n=14 in
each) were planned to be enrolled in order to have 12
evaluable subjects per treatment group completing the study.
Subjects were eligible if they were healthy, nonsmokers, and
between 18 and 45 years of age with a BMI of 18 to 28 kg/
m2. Subjects were of good health as assessed by physical
examination and standard laboratory tests. Consumption of
any grapefruit or grapefruit juice was not permitted during
the course of this study. Drinking of alcoholic beverages or
xanthine-containing beverages was not allowed from 1 day
before entering the clinic until the end of the study. The
subjects had to refrain from strong physical exercise and
strenuous sports activities.
No concomitant medication was allowed during the
course of this study, except for treatment of adverse events.
All subjects gave written informed consent. The study was
conducted at a single centre in Germany in accordance with
good clinical practice (GCP) and the Declaration of Helsinki.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee
and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices of
Germany (BfArM).
Study design
An open-label, two-parallel group (Group A = simvastatin
group; Group B = atorvastatin group) study design with a
fixed treatment sequence was chosen (Actelion trial ID: AC-
057-118) (Fig. 1). In both treatment groups the statin (simvastatin/
atorvastatin) was first administered as monotreatment.
Almorexant was then brought to steady-state
conditions (first, 100 mg followed by 200 mg). Under both
almorexant steady-state conditions single doses of the statin
were administered on separate study days either concomitantly
or separated by 2 h from almorexant (i.e., 24 h after
the previous almorexant administration).
Group A (simvastatin group)
The treatment of Group A consisted of a single oral dose of
40 mg simvastatin on day 1 (mono-treatment), 7, 9, 15, and
17. In addition, on days 2_9 and 10_17 once daily oral doses
of 100 mg and 200 mg almorexant, respectively, were
administered. Simvastatin was administered concomitantly
with almorexant 100 mg on day 7 and 200 mg on day 15.
On day 9 and 17, simvastatin was administered 2 h before
administration of 100 mg and 200 mg almorexant, respectively.
Each simvastatin administration was followed by an
observation period of 24 h.
Group B (atorvastatin group)
The treatment of Group B consisted of a single oral dose of
40 mg atorvastatin on day 1 (mono-treatment), 9, 13, 21,
and 25. In addition, on days 4_15 and 16_27 once daily oral
doses of 100 mg and 200 mg almorexant, respectively, were
administered. Atorvastatin was administered concomitantly
with almorexant 100 mg on day 9 and 200 mg on day 21.
On days 13 and 25, atorvastatin was administered 2 h before
administration of 100 mg and 200 mg almorexant, respectively.
Each atorvastatin administration was followed by an
observation period of 72 h.
All study drug administrations were done in the morning
in fasted state. Almorexant was administered as 100-mg
tablets. Simvastatin was administered as one tablet of
40 mg simvastatin (Zocor¬ forte, Dieckmann Arzneimittel
GmbH, Haar, Germany). Atorvastatin was administered as
one tablet of 40 mg atorvastatin (Sortis¬, Parke-Davis
GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany).

Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples (_4.5 mL) for the measurement of simvastatin
and hydroxyacid simvastatin or atorvastatin and ohydroxy
atorvastatin were collected over 24 h for simvastatin
and 72 h for atorvastatin in EDTA tubes. For measurement
of trough almorexant concentrations blood
samples of _3 mL in EDTA tubes were taken immediately
prior to the next almorexant administration. The
blood samples were immediately put on ice and from
then on protected from light. Centrifugation was done
within 30 min of collection. The plasma samples were
stored at _20 ÁC to _70 ÁC until analysis.
Plasma concentrations of the different analytes were determined
using specific and validated liquid chromatography
coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
assays. For simvastatin and atorvastatin the plasma sample
preparations were performed in a dark room under a
sodium-vapour lamp. The stability of the analytes in plasma
was confirmed throughout the whole study period by implementing
two freshly prepared calibration standards into the
set of calibration standards. The lower limit of quantification
(LOQ) for both simvastatin and hydroxyacid simvastatin
(the active form of simvastatin) LOQ was 0.1024 ng/mL,
the LOQ for both atorvastatin and o-hydroxy atorvastatin
(an active metabolite of atorvastatin) was 0.1 ng/mL, and the
LOQ for almorexant was 0.05 ng/mL.
The inter-assay accuracy and precision [coefficient of
variation (CV%) of the calibration standards] for simvastatin
was 93.1_102.8 % and _6.86_2.82 %, respectively. The
inter-assay accuracy and precision for hydroxyacid simvastatin
was 98.6_101.4 % and _1.87_4.12 %, respectively.
The inter-assay accuracy and precision for atorvastatin was
98.5_101.3 % and _1.46_1.34 %, respectively. The interassay
accuracy and precision for o-hydroxy atorvastatin was
98.6_100.6 % and _1.43_2.18 %, respectively. The interassay
accuracy and precision for almorexant was 95.0_
103.0 % and 7.0_8.1 %, respectively.
Statistical analysis
The number of subjects was based on a precision estimate
approach for the total exposure (AUC0_¡) comparison. An
intra-individual coefficient of variation (CV%) for logtransformed
AUC0_¡ of simvastatin of 38 % was obtained
in a preceding study [14]. Based on this value it was estimated
that, with a sample size of 12 subjects completing the
study, the lower and upper bounds of the 90 % confidence
interval (CI) for the true ratio test (simvastatin plus almorexant):
reference (simvastatin) would be for AUC0_¡ approximately
0.78_1.29. A CV% for log-transformed AUC0-t
of atorvastatin of 22 % was derived from the published
study of Koytchev et al. [16]. Based on this value it was
estimated that, with a sample size of 12 subjects completing

The PK parameters were calculated by noncompartmental
analysis from the plasma concentration-time data using
WinNonlin software version 5.2 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain
View, California, USA).
The differences between the treatments for AUC0-t,
AUC0_¡, Cmax, and t1/2 were explored by calculating the ratios
of the geometric means and their 90 % CIs. Log transformed
Cmax, AUC, and t1/2 values were subjected to an analysis of
variance (ANOVA) including terms for fixed effects for study
days and subject as random effects. Contrasts between each
pair of treatments were presented together with 90 % CIs for
the difference between treatments. The point and interval
estimates were then back-transformed to provide the geometric
mean ratios and their corresponding 90% CIs. To compare
tmax, the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test (Hodges
and Lehmann type point estimate) was used. All calculations
were performed using SAS¬ version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA). Tolerability and safety data were evaluated

22472994,Gemfibrozil is a strong inactivator of CYP2C8 in very small multiple doses.,"Therapeutic doses of gemfibrozil cause mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2C8 via formation of gemfibrozil 1-O-_-glucuronide. We investigated the extent of CYP2C8 inactivation caused by three different doses of gemfibrozil twice dailyfor 5 days, using repaglinide as a probe drug, in 10 healthy volunteers. At the end of this 5-day regimen, there were dose-dependent increases in the area under the plasma concentration_time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0_¡) of repaglinide by3.4-, 5.5-, and 7.0-fold corresponding to 30, 100, and 600 mg of gemfibrozil, respectively, as compared with the control phase (P < 0.001). On the basis of a mechanism-based inactivation model involving gemfibrozil 1-O-_-glucuronide, a gemfibrozil dose of 30 mg twice daily was estimated to inhibit CYP2C8 by >70% and 100 mg twice daily was estimated to inhibit it by >90%. Hence, gemfibrozil is a strong inactivator of CYP2C8 even in very small, subtherapeutic, multiple doses. Administration of small gemfibrozil doses may be useful in optimizing the pharmacokinetics of CYP2C8 substrate drugs and in reducing the formation of their potentially toxic metabolites via CYP2C8.","Many significant drug_drug interactions are caused by mechanism-
based inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
Mechanism-based inhibitors inactivate their victim enzymes
permanently, and enzyme activity can be regained only by de
novo synthesis of the enzyme.1 Therefore, mechanism-based
inhibition can cause a long-lasting decrease in enzyme activity
and lead to significant changes in the concentrations of drugs
metabolized through the enzyme concerned.
Gemfibrozil is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo.2,3 Its inhibitory
effect is based on mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2C8 by
its metabolite, gemfibrozil 1-O-_-glucuronide.4,5 Although a
drugÍs metabolites often contribute to its CYP enzyme-inhibiting
effects, it is uncommon that a phase II metabolite significantly
inhibits CYP enzymes.6 With therapeutic doses of gemfibrozil,
i.e., 600 mg twice daily, the CYP2C8-dependent metabolism of
drugs was shown to decrease drastically.3,7_10 Gemfibrozil has
been recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration
and the European Medicines Agency as a model inhibitor of
CYP2C8 for in vivo studies.11,12
CYP2C8 accounts for ~6% of the hepatic CYP content13 but
is not significantly expressed in small-intestine enterocytes.14 It
contributes to the metabolism of several important drugs, e.g.,
paclitaxel, cerivastatin, rosiglitazone, repaglinide, amiodarone,
amodiaquine, and montelukast.3,7,8,15_17 The antidiabetes
agent repaglinide has been recommended by the Food and Drug
Administration and the European Medicines Agency as a probe
drug for studying CYP2C8 activity.11,12 The formation of repaglinideÍs
main metabolite, M2 and, even more so, the formation
of M4 is largely dependent on CYP2C8.18_20 The pharmacokinetic
variables of repaglinide and of these metabolites reflect
hepatic CYP2C8 activity.21_25 Also, genetic variability in the
SLCO1B1 gene encoding organic anion_transporting polypeptide
1B1 (OATP1B1) and coadministration of drugs affecting
OATP1B1 and/or CYP3A4 may slightly alter the pharmacokinetics
of repaglinide.20,26_28
The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent of
inhibition of CYP2C8 activity by different doses of gemfibrozil,
using repaglinide as a probe drug. To achieve this, each of 10
healthy volunteers was given a single dose of repaglinide after
pretreatment with 30, 100, or 600 mg of gemfibrozil or placebo
twice daily, in a four-phase randomized crossover study",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
22348256,Decrease in the oral bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate after co-medication with rifampicin.,"This study examined the effects of the CYP3A/P-glycoprotein inducer, rifampicin, on the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran following oral administration of the prodrug, dabigatran etexilate. This was an open-label, fixed-sequence, four-period study in healthy volunteers. Subjects received a single dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg on day 1, rifampicin 600 mg once daily on days 2-8, and single doses of dabigatran etexilate on days 9, 16 and 23. Twenty-four subjects were treated, of whom 22 received all treatments. Relative to the reference (single dose of dabigatran etexilate alone; treatment A), administration of dabigatran etexilate following 7 days of rifampicin (treatment B) decreased the geometric mean (gMean) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-¡)) and maximal plasma concentration (C(max)) of total dabigatran by 67 and 65.5%, respectively. The time to peak and the terminal half-life were not affected. The gMean ratio for the primary comparison (treatment B vs. treatment A) was 33.0% (90% confidence interval 26.5, 41.2%) for AUC(0-¡) and 34.5% (90% confidence interval 26.9, 44.1%) for C(max), indicating a significant effect on total dabigatran exposure (total pharmacologically active dabigatran represents the sum of nonconjugated dabigatran and dabigatran glucuronide). After a 7 day (treatment C) or 14 day washout (treatment D), the AUC(0-¡) and C(max) of dabigatran were reduced by 18 and 20%, and by 15 and 20%, respectively, compared with treatment A, which was considered not clinically relevant. The overall safety profile of all treatments was good. Administration of rifampicin for 7 days resulted in a significant reduction in the bioavailability of dabigatran, which returned almost to baseline after 7 days washout.","Methods
Study design and treatments
This study was an open-label, four-period, fixed-sequence
trial performed in healthy male and female subjects to
investigate the relative bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate
given as single doses, either alone or after multiple
doses of rifampicin,or after cessation of rifampicin.Twentyfour
subjects were to be enrolled, with at least eight of
each sex. The trial was conducted at CRS Clinical Research
ServicesMannheim GmbH (Mannheim,Germany) in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International
Conference on Harmonisation Harmonised Tripartite
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), after approval
by the local independent ethics committee (IEC). The trial
was sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &
Co. KG, Ingelheim, Germany.
Dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa¬; Boehringer Ingelheim
Pharma GmbH & Co. KG) was administered as 150 mg
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose capsules. Rifampicin was
administered as the commercially available Rifa¬ 600 mg
coated tablets (Gru_nenthal GmbH, Aachen, Germany).
The subjects received single oral doses of dabigatran
etexilate (150 mg),always in the morning at 08.00 h,during
the following four treatment periods (Figure 1): period 1
(treatment A), dabigatran etexilate 150 mg administered
on day 1 (reference); period 2 (treatment B), rifampicin
600 mgonce daily administered for 7 days (days 2_8) in the
evening at 20.00 h, with the last dose of rifampicin given
12 h before dabigatran etexilate 150 mg administered on
day 9 (test 1); period 3 (treatment C), a single dose of
dabigatran etexilate 150 mg administered on day 16 after
7 days of rifampicin washout (test 2); and period 4 (treatment
D), a single dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg
administered on day 23 after 14 days of rifampicin
washout (test 3).
A screening examination (visit 1) was performed
between days -21 and -1. Washout periods between
subsequent dabigatran etexilate doses were included
between the study days (days 1, 9, 16 and 23). The end-oftrial
examination was scheduled between days 25 and 28
(time window).
Subjects
Healthy male and female subjects [based upon complete
medical history, physical examination, vital signs (blood
pressure and pulse rate), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG),
clinical and laboratory tests], aged  18_45 years, with a
body mass index between  18.5 and  29.9 kgm-2, were

included in the trial. Participants gave their written
informed consent in accordance with GCP and local
legislation.
The exclusion criteria included any of the following:
gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,
metabolic, immunological or hormonal disorders, risk of
bleeding, previous use of rifampicin or other P-gp or
CYP450 inhibitors/inducers within 4 weeks prior to the
start of treatment.
Study end-points
The primary PK end-points were area under the
concentration_time curve (AUC0_´) and maximal plasma
concentration (Cmax) of total dabigatran (free plus conjugated).
The primary comparison was between treatment B
(single dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg after multiple
doses of rifampicin 600 mg) vs. reference treatment A
(single dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg before any
rifampicin treatment), with a-adjustment of the 90% confidence
intervals (CIs) of AUC0_´ and Cmax to account for
multiple testing of two correlated primary end-points [22].
Further comparisons were performed between treatment
C (single dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg after 7
days of washout since last intake of rifampicin 600 mg) and
reference treatment A, and between treatment D (single
dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg after 14 days washout
after the last intake of rifampicin 600 mg) and reference
treatment A.
The secondary PK end-points included AUC0_´ and Cmax
of free dabigatran, and Cmax and time from dosing to
maximal plasma concentration (tmax) of total dabigatran.
The ratio of urinary concentrations of 6b-hydroxycortisol
to cortisol as a marker of induction of CYP3A4 by rifampicin
and an evaluation of safety were other secondary
end-points.
Pharmacokinetic determinations
Blood samples for dabigatran PK measurements were collected
before (-0.5 h) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24
and 34 h after administration of a single dose of 150 mg
dabigatran etexilate in each treatment period. Plasma
concentrations of free, nonconjugated dabigatran, total
dabigatran [sum of free and conjugated dabigatran (measured
after alkaline cleavage of conjugates)], the prodrug,
dabigatran etexilate, and the intermediate metabolites,
BIBR 1087 SE and BIBR 951 BS, were determined by a validated
high-performance liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method at AAI Pharma
Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, Neu-Ulm, Germany.
Briefly,plasma was prepared from EDTA blood (at 2000g_
4000g for 10 minutes); for the determination of free dabigatran,
50 ml of plasma was aliquoted, diluted with 50 ml 0.2 M
ammonium formate buffer (pH 3.5),spiked with 40 ml internal
standard solution (100 ng ml-1 [13C6]dabigatran), mixed and
centrifuged. For the determination of total dabigatran, 50 ml
of plasma was aliquoted, spiked with 40 ml internal standard
solution and mixed with 20 ml 0.2 M sodium hydroxide. After
2 h of incubation at 37ÁC, the samples were acidified with
30 ml 0.2 M hydrochloric acid, mixed and then centrifuged.
For each determination, an aliquot of the resulting
supernatant was transferred into autosampler vials. The
analytes were extracted by column switching and were
chromatographed on an analytical C18 reversed phase
HPLC column with gradient elution.
The lowest limit of quantification of free or total
dabigatran was 1 ng ml-1, the inaccuracy was at maximum
-5.37% (at 3 ng ml-1 nominal dabigatran concentration),
and the imprecision was always <9%.The limit of quantification
was also 1 ngml-1 for the prodrug (dabigatran etexilate)
and the intermediate metabolites, BIBR 1087 SE and
BIBR 951 BS.The inaccuracy was highest with BIBR 1087 SE

(_16.23 and -7.75% at 3 and 9 ngml-1 spike concentrations,
respectively); imprecision was always <10%.
In addition, total dabigatran urine concentrations were
measured. The calibration range was between 20 and
1000 ng ml-1, and the analyses were performed with high
accuracy (inaccuracy <2%) and precision (imprecision <7%).
The 6b-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio, an established
marker of human hepatic CYP450 3A induction (but not a
marker for P-gp activity), was assessed in morning spot
urine samples collected within 4 h after the complete first
morning voids,but before drug administration at the latest
(typically 30 min before). Samples were taken in the
morning after subjects had received three doses of
rifampicin during treatment B and before administration
of dabigatran in each respective treatment period. Thus,
morning spot urine samples were collected at baseline,
day 1 (period 1), days 5 and 9 (period 2), day 16 (period 3)
and day 23 (period 4).
Urinary concentrations of cortisol and 6bhydroxycortisol
were analysed by an HPLC-MS/MS method
at SGS Cephac Europe, St BenoÓt, France. The calibration
curves for 6b-hydroxycortisol and cortisol ranged between
1_1000 and 10_3000 ng ml-1, respectively. The assay had
a low interday inaccuracy and imprecision of <11 (6bhydroxycortisol)
and 13% (cortisol) at all spiked concentrations.
Induction of CYP3A by rifampicin was assessed by
the change in the ratio of 6b-hydroxycortisol/cortisol after
a 7 day treatment of 600 mgrifampicin once daily and after
cessation of rifampicin,compared with the ratio at baseline
before the administration of rifampicin.
Safety
Safety was assessed by medical examination, pulse rate,
blood pressure, 12-lead ECG, laboratory parameters, and
the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AEs). The
investigator assessed tolerability based on AEs and the
laboratory evaluation according to the categories ïgoodÍ,
ïsatisfactoryÍ, ïnot satisfactoryÍ and ïbadÍ.
Statistical methods
Point estimators (geometric means;gMeans) of the median
intrasubject ratios of AUC0_´ and Cmax were calculated. The
statistical model was an analysis of variance model on logtransformed
parameters, including effects for ïsubjectÍ and
ïtreatmentÍ. However, a confidence interval for the relative
bioavailability that does not contain the value 100% is
equivalent to an effect significantly different from zero.
Confidence intervals were based on the residual error from
the investigated treatment comparison. Descriptive statistics
for all other parameters were calculated.",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
16321618,Cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor itraconazole affects plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone in schizophrenic patients.,"Despite the belief that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 alone is responsible for the metabolism of risperidone, several studies suggest that CYP3A may be involved. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of itraconazole, a CYP3A inhibitor, on the plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone in schizophrenic patients in relation to CYP2D6 genotype. Nineteen schizophrenic patients treated with 2 to 8 mg/d of risperidone received 200 mg/d of itraconazole for a week. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured immediately before and after itraconazole treatment, as well as at 1 week after itraconazole treatment was stopped, together with clinical assessment by use of the Udvalg for Kliniske UndersÀgelser Side Effect Rating Scale and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Dose-normalized plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone before itraconazole treatment (0.9 +/- 0.8 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1) and 6.9 +/- 3.3 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1), respectively) were significantly elevated after itraconazole treatment (1.6 +/- 1.3 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1) and 11.3 +/- 4.5 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1)) and decreased 1 week after its discontinuation (1.0 +/- 0.8 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1) and 7.2 +/- 3.7 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1)) (P < .01). However, the ratio of risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone, an index of CYP2D6 activity, did not differ before itraconazole treatment (0.14 +/- 0.13), after itraconazole treatment (0.15 +/- 0.13), and 1 week after discontinuation (0.14 +/- 0.13) (P > .05). Itraconazole increased the concentrations of risperidone by 69% (P < .001) and 75% (P < .01) in CYP2D6 extensive and poor metabolizers, respectively. In addition, the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) also increased similarly, by 71% (P < .001) and 73% (P < .05), respectively, with itraconazole, without a significant difference between CYP2D6 genotypes. The scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale decreased significantly but only by 6% after itraconazole treatment (P < .05); however, the scores on the Udvalg for Kliniske UndersÀgelser Side Effect Rating Scale were not changed. Our results provide in vivo evidence of the involvement of CYP3A in the disposition of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. In addition to CYP2D6, treatment with CYP3A inhibitor(s) including itraconazole may influence clinical symptoms and risperidone side effects.","METHODS
Study population. The subjects were 19 Korean
schizophrenic inpatients (15 men and 4 women), all of
whom fulfilled the criteria for schizophrenia according
to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fourth Edition (American Psychiatric Association,
1994). The mean age and body weight
( SD) were 41.4   9.6 years and 66.8   10.3 kg,
respectively. Eleven patients were smokers ( 10 cigarettes
per day). None was a heavy drinker. The study
was approved by the local ethics committee of Yangsan
Psychiatric Hospital, Yangsan, Korea, and written informed
consent to participate in this study was obtained
from the patients and their families.
Study design. All patients had received risperidone
treatment for more than 2 months before enrollment in
the study. The subjects had received 2 to 8 mg of risperidone
(mean   SD, 4.1   2.3 mg) per day (at 8 AM and 8
PM). The elimination half-lives of risperidone and
9-hydroxyrisperidone have been reported to be 3 to 20
hours and 20 to 29 hours, respectively.4 Therefore plasma
concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone
had already reached steady state in all subjects before the
study was initiated. Female patients were not taking oral
contraceptives. The doses of the coadministered drugs
were fixed throughout the study period. Itraconazole,
200 mg/d once a day (at 8 PM), was administered to all
subjects for 1 week and then withdrawn for 1 week.
Blood sampling was performed before and during
itraconazole treatment, just before the morning dose,
and 1 week after its discontinuation. On the same days
as the blood sampling, the severity of illness and side
effects were evaluated by use of the Brief Psychiatric
Rating Scale20 and the Udvalg for Kliniske UndersÀgelser
(UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale.21 The 18 items
on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were separated
into 5 clusters, as follows: positive (exaggerated selfesteem,
suspicion, hallucinations, unusual thought content),
excitement (hostility, uncooperativeness, psychomotor
agitation), cognitive (conceptual disorganization,
specific motor disturbances, disorientation), negative
(emotional withdrawal, psychomotor retardation, blunted
affect), and anxiety-depression (somatic concern, anxiety_
psychic, self-depreciation, anxiety_somatic, depressive
mood) symptoms, as classified by Lindenmayer et al.22
Nineteen items were selected from the UKU Side Effects
Rating Scale to assess the side effects of risperidone.
Items were further separated into 3 subgroups of side
effects, as follows: psychic (concentration difficulties, asthenia,
sleepiness, failing memory, depression, tension),
neurologic (dystonia, rigidity, hypokinesia, hyperkinesia,
tremor, akathisia, increased salivation), and autonomic
(accommodation disturbances, reduced salivation, constipation,
micturition disturbances, orthostatic dizziness, palpitations).
Analysis of plasma concentrations of risperidone
and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Plasma concentrations of
risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were analyzed

with a validated HPLC method, by use of a modification
of a previously published method.23 In brief,
plasma (1 mL) was added to 10-mL glass tubes containing
the internal standard (methylrisperidone, 50  L
of 1  g/mL). To this, 200  L of 1-mol/L sodium
carbonate and 6 mL of a mixture of hexane and isoamyl
alcohol (98:2 [vol/vol]) were added. After vigorous
vortex mixing for 5 minutes, the mixture was centrifuged
for 15 minutes at 1500g and the organic phase
was transferred to a clean glass tube and evaporated to
dryness via a vacuum drier. The dry residue was reconstituted
with 80  L of mobile phase, and a 50- L
aliquot of this solution was injected onto an HPLC
system with a Capcell PAK MG120 C18 column (5  m,
3.0   250 mm) (Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan). The mobile
phase was composed of 40-mmol/L ammonium acetate
(pH 6.8 adjusted with 1N hydrochloric acid) and acetonitrile
(60:40 [vol/vol]). An electrochemical detector
(Shiseido) was used, and the applied voltage for analysis
was 950 mV. A linear calibration curve in the
range of 0.1 to 200 ng/mL was established for risperidone
and 9-hydroxyrisperidone (r2   0.9998 for risperidone
and r2   0.9994 for 9-hydroxyrisperidone).
Intraday and interday coefficients of variation were less
than 10.8% and 9.5% for risperidone and
9-hydroxyrisperidone, respectively. The limits of quantification
were 0.1 ng/mL for risperidone and 0.1 ng/mL
for 9-hydroxyrisperidone.
CYP2D6 genotyping. Genomic deoxyribonucleic
acid was isolated from blood by use of the QIAamp
DNA Blood Mini Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
All subjects were screened with allele-specific
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), extra-long PCR, and
PCR_restriction fragment length polymorphism methods
to exclude any subjects with the CYP2D6 alleles
*2, *2xN, *3, *4, *5, *10, *18, and *21 that frequently
occur in Asians, as previously reported.24,25
Statistical analyses. Differences in plasma concentrations
of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and their sum
(active moiety) before and during itraconazole treatment
and after itraconazole discontinuation were compared by
use of repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons. Changes in the plasma
risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone ratio and in the Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale and UKU side effect scores before
and during itraconazole treatment and after itraconazole
discontinuation were also compared by the Friedman
repeated-measures ANOVA on ranks, followed by
the Tukey test. The Spearman nonparametric test for the
correlation of different variables was used. Results are
given in the text as mean   SD. A P value less than .05
was regarded as statistically significant. SigmaStat, version
3.10 (Systat Software, Richmond, Calif), was used
for these statistical analyses.",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
19474787,ABCG2 polymorphism markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin.,"The ABCG2 c.421C>A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was determined in 660 healthy Finnish volunteers, of whom 32 participated in a pharmacokinetic crossover study involving the administration of 20 mg atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. The frequency of the c.421A variant allele was 9.5% (95% confidence interval 8.1-11.3%). Subjects with the c.421AA genotype (n = 4) had a 72% larger mean area under the plasma atorvastatin concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) than individuals with the c.421CC genotype had (n = 16; P = 0.049). In participants with the c.421AA genotype, the rosuvastatin AUC(0-infinity) was 100% greater than in those with c.421CA (n = 12) and 144% greater than in those with the c.421CC genotype. Also, those with the c.421AA genotype showed peak plasma rosuvastatin concentrations 108% higher than those in the c.421CA genotype group and 131% higher than those in the c.421CC genotype group (P < or = 0.01). In MDCKII-ABCG2 cells, atorvastatin transport was increased in the apical direction as compared with vector control cells (transport ratio 1.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1). These results indicate that the ABCG2 polymorphism markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and, even more so, of rosuvastatin-potentially affecting the efficacy and toxicity of statin therapy.","cardiovascular
diseases, are among the most widely used drugs
in the world. Recent evidence has indicated that variability in
genes affecting statin disposition may significantly affect the
safety of statin therapy. For example, patients homozygous for the
SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (rs4149056, p.Val174Ala) single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) were shown to have markedly increased
plasma concentrations of active simvastatin acid (on average,
3.2-fold) and a markedly increased risk of developing myopathy
(odds ratio 16.9 with a dosage of 80 mg simvastatin
daily), as
compared with individuals with the c.521TT genotype.1,2 The
SLCO1B1 gene encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide
1B1, an influx transporter expressed on the sinusoidal
membrane of human hepatocytes.3 The SLCO1B1 c.521T>C
SNP also affects the plasma concentrations of other statins,
such as atorvastatin (2.4-fold increase), pravastatin (1.9-fold
increase), and rosuvastatin (1.7-fold increase), whereas no effect
has been seen on fluvastatin.4,5 It is therefore possible that other
transporter genes also affect the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and
toxicity of statins.
Both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are administered in the
active acid form. The bioavailability associated with each of
them, when administered orally, is ~10_20%.6 Atorvastatin acid compounds such as estrogens and estrogen conjugates.
ABCG2
seems to protect normal cells against cytotoxic agents, but it also
induces tumor resistance to various anticancer drugs. ABCG2
functions as a physiological barrier as it limits the absorption
of its substrates from the gut as well as their entry through the
blood_brain barrier and through the placenta into the fetus. It
also increases the excretion of its substrates into the bile and
urine, thereby potentially reducing systemic exposure to many
drugs. For ABCG2, rosuvastatin is a substrate,9,10 but it is not
known whether atorvastatin
is one.
The c.421C>A SNP (rs2231142), resulting in an amino acid
change p.Gln141Lys, is one of the best-characterized sequence
variations in the ABCG2 gene. In in vitro studies, the c.421A
variant
has been associated with reduced ABCG2 transport
activity with respect to estrone-sulfate, methotrexate, mitoxantrone,
and topotecan.11_13 It is not completely understood how  this SNP affects ABCG2 function; some studies have suggested
that it reduces ABCG2 expression,11,14_16 and other studies have
suggested that it reduces the ATPase activity of ABCG2.12,17
However, the p.Gln141Lys variant is located within the cell apart
from the ATP-binding region. In humans in vivo, the c.421A
allele has been found to be associated with increases in plasma
concentrations of topotecan, diflomotecan, and sulfasalazine, as
compared with the c.421C allele.13,18_20 Furthermore, in a small
study of healthy Chinese volunteers,21 the area under the plasma
concentration_time curve (AUC) of rosuvastatin was found
to be greater in carriers of the c.421A allele; however, it is not
known whether this polymorphism affects the pharmacokinetics
of atorvastatin. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency
of the ABCG2 c.421C>A SNP in the Finnish population
and to compare the effects of the SNP on the pharmacokinetics
of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin in a prospective genotype panel
study. In addition, transport of atorvastatin was investigated in
an ABCG2-expressing cell line.
and its inactive lactone metabolite are biotransformed mainly
by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 to 2-hydroxyatorvastatin and
4-hydroxyatorvastatin,
which are active in the acid form and
inactive in the lactone form (Figure 1). In contrast to atorvastatin,
rosuvastatin is not subject to extensive metabolism„the main
metabolites are active N-desmethylrosuvastatin formed by
CYP2C9 and inactive rosuvastatin lactone. Approximately
10% of orally administered rosuvastatin is excreted unchanged
in urine, whereas atorvastatin and its metabolites are excreted
primarily in the feces.
ATP-binding cassette G2 protein (ABCG2, also known as
breast cancer resistance protein) is an efflux transporter that is

18094221,"Effect of rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone.","The authors studied the effect of rifampin, a dual inducer of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risperidone in humans. Ten healthy male subjects were treated daily for 7 days with 600 mg rifampin or with placebo. On day 6, a single dose of 1 mg risperidone was administered. Plasma risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations were measured. Rifampin significantly decreased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve by 51% for risperidone, by 43% for 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and by 45% for the active moieties (risperidone + 9-hydroxyrisperidone). Rifampin also decreased the peak plasma concentration of risperidone by 38%, 9-hydroxyrisperidone by 46%, and the active moieties by 41%. The apparent oral clearance of risperidone approximately doubled after rifampin treatment. Thus, rifampin reduced the exposure to risperidone, probably because of a decrease in its bioavailability through the induction of CYP3A and probably P-glycoprotein.","SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Subjects
Ten healthy Korean men (ages 23-38 years; weight
65-80 kg) participated in the study after they had
given written informed consent. The volunteers were
confirmed as healthy by medical history, physical
examination, and routine laboratory tests before they
were enrolled in the study.
Study Design
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Gil Medical Center, Gachon Medical
School, Incheon, Korea. A randomized, open-label,
2-way crossover study was performed. The study
phases were separated by a 4-week washout period,
and the general study design was identical in both
phases. The participants were given either 600 mg
rifampin (Rifodex, Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical
Corp, Seoul, Korea) or matched placebo orally once
daily at 8 PM for 7 days, and the order of administration
of the 2 drugs was determined by a randomization
schedule generated prior to the start of the study. On
the morning of day 6, a single oral dose of 1 mg
risperidone (Rispedal, Jassen Pharma Korea, Seoul,
Korea) was administered with water at 9 AM.
CYP2D6 Genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from blood using the
QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Extraction Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). All subjects were screened with
allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification,
extra-long PCR, and PCR_restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) methods to exclude
any subjects with the CYP2D6 alleles *2, *2xN, *3,
*4, *5, *10, *18, and *21, which are frequent in
Asians.21,22
Determination of Risperidone and
9-Hydroxyrisperidone
Blood samples were drawn immediately before
and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 30 hours after
the administration of risperidone. Blood samples,
collected in heparinized glass tubes (Vacutainer,
Becton & Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), were
centrifuged, and the separated plasma samples were
stored at _70ÁC until assay.
Plasma concentrations of risperidone and
9-hydroxyrisperidone were determined by highperformance
liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) as described, with modifications.
22,23 In brief, 20 _L of the internal standard
(desipramine, 2 _g/mL) and 0.1 mL of 0.1 M sodium
hydroxide were added to 0.5 mL of plasma, followed
by liquid_liquid extraction for 10 minutes with 4 mL
diethyl ether/methylene chloride (6/4, vol/vol). After
centrifugation, the organic phase was evaporated
to dryness at ambient temperature in a Speed-Vac
(Savant, Holbrook, New York). The residue was reconstituted
in 0.1 mL of mobile phase, and 5-_L aliquots
were injected for analysis. A QTrap 4000 LC/MS/MS
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California)
equipped with an Agilent 1100 series high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent,
Wilmington, Delaware) was used. Chromatographic
separation of the compound was accomplished using
a Luna C18 column (2.0 _ 100 mm, 3 _m; Phenomenex,
Torrance, California), with use of a mobile phase
consisting of 10 mM ammonium acetate and an
acetonitrile mixture (2/8, vol/vol) containing 0.1%
formic acid, delivered at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min.
The MS/MS system was operated using an electrospray
in positive ionization mode. For risperidone,
9-hydroxyrisperidone, and desipramine, the precursorto-
product ion reactions monitored were m/z
411_ 191.2, 427_207.2, and 267_208, respectively.

9-hydroxyrisperidone, and desipramine were 1.06,
1.05, and 1.12 minutes, respectively. The lower
limit of quantification for both risperidone and
9-hydroxyrisperidone was 0.01 ng/mL. The interassay
precision for all analytes was less than 12.3%.
Pharmacodynamic Evaluations
For the evaluations of side effects, the Udvalg for
Kliniske UndersÀgelser (UKU) side effect rating
scales24 were monitored before and at 2, 4, 8, 12, and
24 hours after the administration of risperidone.
Nineteen items were selected from the UKU side
effect rating scale to assess the side effects of risperidone.
Items were further separated into 3 subgroups
of side effects as follows: psychic (concentration difficulties,
asthenia/lassitude, sleepiness, failing memory,
depression, and tension), neurological (dystonia,
rigidity, hypokinesia, hyperkinesia, tremor, akathisia,
and increased salivation), and autonomic (accommodation
disturbances, reduced salivation, constipation,
micturition disturbances, orthostatic dizziness,
and palpitations). The present study was designed
in an open-label manner because rifampin induces
orange-red discolorization of urine. However, to
reduce the bias of the pharmacodynamic evaluation
as much as possible, the rating scales were assessed
by 1 psychiatrist who did not know which drug was
administered.
Pharmacokinetic and
Pharmacodynamic Analyses
WinNonlin Professional Version 5.01 (Pharsight Corp,
Mountain View, California) software was used for pharmacokinetic
analysis. We analyzed the plasma concentrations
of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone by
noncompartmental analysis. The Cmax (peak plasma
concentration) values and the time to reach Cmax
(tmax) were estimated directly from the observed
plasma concentration_time data. The area under the
plasma concentration_time curve from time 0 to 30
hours (AUClast) was calculated using the linear
trapezoidal rule. The AUC from time 0 to infinity
(AUC¡) was calculated as AUC¡ = AUClast + Ct/Ke,
where Ct is the last plasma concentration measured,
and Ke is the elimination rate constant determined
using linear regression analysis of the logarithm_linear
part of the plasma concentration_time curve. The t1/2
of risperidone was calculated as t1/2 = ln2/Ke. The
apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of risperidone was
calculated as CL/F = dose/AUC0_¡.
The pharmacodynamic effects of risperidone were
described as the score changes of the UKU side effect
rating scales from baseline that were observed until
24 hours after dosing. The area under the effect curve
(AUEC = score change _ h) for the UKU side effect
rating scales was calculated from the time versus
score change curve using the linear trapezoidal rule,
as described above. Maximal effect (Emax), the greatest
score change in the UKU side effect rating scale relative
to baseline, and the time to reach Emax (tmax) were
determined for individual subjects.
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SD. The pharmacokinetic
parameters of risperidone and
9-hydroxyrisperidone were compared between the 2
phases with a paired t test (2-tailed) or Wilcoxon
signed rank test, as appropriate, after normality testing.
All the data were analyzed using the statistical
program SAS for Windows (Version 9.1.3; SAS
Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Differences were
considered statistically significant at P < .05.",DDI Randomized clinical trials
19552746,"Assessment of a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between simvastatin and anacetrapib, a potent cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, in healthy subjects.","Anacetrapib is an orally active, potent inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which is in development for the treatment of dyslipidaemia. Because of the likely use of anacetrapib with hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, we aimed to evaluate the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with simvastatin. A randomized, two-period, two-treatment, balanced, open-label, crossover study in 12 healthy subjects was performed. Subjects received simvastatin 40 mg alone or anacetrapib 150 mg co-administered with simvastatin 40 mg, once daily. Both treatments were administered following a low-fat breakfast for 14 days, separated by a wash-out period of at least 14 days. Safety and tolerability, simvastatin and simvastatin acid concentrations, and lipoproteins, were assessed. Both treatments were well tolerated. The pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were similar with and without anacetrapib administration {AUC(0-24 h) geometric mean ratio [90% confidence interval (CI)] for simvastatin acid and simvastatin were 1.36 [1.17, 1.57] and 1.30 [1.14, 1.47], respectively} based on the prespecified comparability bounds of (0.50, 2.00). Treatment with simvastatin alone led to a mean (95% CI) % reduction from baseline in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) of -36% (-27, -46) compared with a reduction of -54% (-44, -63) for anacetrapib co-administered with simvastatin. There appears to be no clinically meaningful effect of anacetrapib on the pharmacokinetic parameters of simvastatin. When co-administered with simvastatin, anacetrapib appeared to exhibit incremental LDL-C-lowering efficacy, due to CETP inhibition. Co-administration of anacetrapib and simvastatin was well tolerated.","Methods
Study participants
All study participants provided written informed consent prior to enrolment. The protocol was approved by IntegReview Ethical Review Board (Austin, TX, USA) and was conducted in accordance with the guidelines on good clinical practice and with ethical standards for human experimentation established by the Declaration of Helsinki. Healthy male or female subjects of nonreproductive potential, 18_50 years old, participated in this study, which was conducted in the USA. Subjects were in good general health according to routine medical history, physical examination, vital signs and laboratory data.

Study design
This was an open-label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, balanced, crossover study in 12 healthy subjects. In Treatment A, subjects received a once daily oral dose of a 40-mg simvastatin tablet (ZOCOR») for 14 days in the morning. In Treatment B, subjects received a once-daily oral dose of 150 mg anacetrapib, as liquid-filled capsules, co-administered with a once-daily oral dose of a 40-mg simvastatin tablet for 14 days in the morning. All doses were administered following a standardized low-fat breakfast, and there was a wash-out of at least 14 days in duration between treatment periods.

Pharmacokinetic blood samples for simvastatin and simvastatin acid were collected on day 14 of Treatments A and B and predose on days 1, 12, 13 and 14, and measured simultaneously according to a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method [9]. Serum samples were collected for the measurement of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and the apolipoproteins (Apo) B and A1 predose on day 1 (Treatments A and B) and day 14 (Treatments A and B). Assays for HMG-CoA reductase activity were not performed.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis
Plasma concentration vs. time data were analysed by noncompartmental pharmacokinetic methods using WinNonlin (Enterprise version 5.0.1; Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA, USA) to determine the pharmacokinetic parameter estimates. The actual blood sampling times relative to the dosing times were used for all pharmacokinetic analysis. AUC0_¡ was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method for ascending concentrations and the log trapezoidal method for descending concentrations. Cmax and Tmax were obtained by inspection. The elimination rate constant (_z) was determined by linear regression of the terminal phase of the logarithm of plasma concentration vs. time data. A minimum of three data points were used. The t1/2 was calculated as the ratio of the natural log of 2 and _z.

Safety and tolerability
The safety and tolerability of anacetrapib and simvastatin were assessed throughout the study by physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, laboratory safety tests (serum sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, fasting serum glucose, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin; haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count, white blood cell count, absolute counts of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes; urinalysis), and adverse experience monitoring.

Statistical methods
One subject discontinued from the study in period 1 and was excluded from analysis.

The pharmacokinetic parameters for simvastatin acid and simvastatin, AUC0_24 h and Cmax, were natural log transformed and evaluated with a linear mixed-effects model with treatment as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. Mean between-treatment differences and corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from the model and exponentiated to obtain geometric mean treatment ratios and CIs. The primary hypothesis was that the AUC0_24 h geometric mean ratio (GMR) of simvastatin and simvastatin acid following multiple oral doses of 40 mg simvastatin (vs. anacetrapib alone) is contained within the interval (0.50, 2.00).

23381840,"The influence of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor.","A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted to assess the effect of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban - an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor. Subjects (n_=_34) were enrolled into four groups: young males or females (aged 18-45 years) and elderly males or females (aged >75 years), and received a single dose of 10_mg rivaroxaban. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined. Gender had no significant influence on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of rivaroxaban was 41% higher in elderly compared with young subjects; corresponding AUC values for the inhibition of Factor Xa activity and prolongation of prothrombin time were also higher. These changes were the result of reduced rivaroxaban clearance in elderly subjects, mainly owing to decreased renal function. The influence of age was not considered clinically relevant. The maximum plasma concentration was not increased in elderly subjects, and pharmacodynamic parameters returned close to baseline within 24 hours. The results indicate that age alone and gender did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in healthy subjects after a 10_mg dose.","Methods
Study Design and Subjects
This was a single_center, randomized, single_blind,
placebo_controlled, parallel_group study conducted at
Pharm PlanNet Contract Research GmbH, M_nchengladbach,
Germany. Healthy male and female Caucasian
subjects with a body mass index of 20_32 kg/m2 were
enrolled into four discrete study groups: young males or
females (aged 18_45 years), and elderly males or females
(aged >75 years). Subjects were excluded from the study
if they had any known coagulation disorders (e.g., von
Willebrand disease or hemophilias) or conditions associated
with an increased risk of bleeding (e.g., periodontitis,
hemorrhoids, acute gastroenteritis, or acute peptic ulcer).
Young female subjects underwent pregnancy testing
before study drug administration.
Subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose
of rivaroxaban 10 mg or placebo, in a 2:1 ratio. Selection
of this dose was based on previous phase I studies of
rivaroxaban in healthy subjects, which demonstrated the
safety and tolerability of single doses of up to 80 mg or
multiple doses of up to 30 mg twice daily. In these trials,
rivaroxaban 10 mg had relevant pharmacodynamic effects
(e.g., inhibition of Factor Xa activity).16,17 Therefore, it
was expected that a single dose of 10 mg would provide
adequate pharmacodynamic effects, combined with a low
risk of bleeding in the elderly study groups.
Subjects entered the study center the evening
before drug administration. After an overnight fast, all
treatments were administered with a standardized
breakfast. The study consisted of a single profile day
and inhouse observation until 72 hours after drug
administration. Subjects returned for an endofstudy visit
12 weeks later.
The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference of
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration
of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines on
Good Clinical Practice and German drug law. The study
was approved by the North Rhine Medical Council in
Dusseldorf, Germany. All subjects provided written,
informed consent.
Pharmacokinetic Sampling and Analysis
Blood samples for the pharmacokinetic analysis of
rivaroxaban were collected at the time of study drug
administration and 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours,
4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 15 hours, 24 hours,
36 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours thereafter. Samples
were centrifuged to obtain plasma. Urine samples
for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken 0_4 hours,
4_8 hours, 8_12 hours, 12_24 hours, 24_48 hours, and
48_72 hours after drug administration. Plasma and urine
samples were stored below  15ÁC and analyzed within
8 weeks of sampling. Plasma and urine rivaroxaban
concentrations were determined using a fully validated
high performance liquid chromatography_tandem mass
spectrometry method after solid phase extraction.24 The
calibration range for plasma samples was 0.5_1 000 _g/L.
Quality control samples in the concentration range
1.35_813 _g/L were determined with an accuracy of
97_103%and a precision of 4.34_6.62% (n _ 12 each). The
calibration range for urine samples was 0.0997_19.9 mg/L.
Quality control samples in the concentration range
0.224_16 mg/L were determined with an accuracy of
95.11_98.06% and a precision of 2.92_10.69% (n _ 11).
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed
were the area under the concentration_time curve (AUC)
and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of rivaroxaban.
Secondary parameters analyzed included AUC and
Cmax normalized to rivaroxaban dose and body weight
(AUCnorm and Cmax,norm, respectively), time to Cmax (tmax),
and the half_life of rivaroxaban associated with the terminal
slope (t_). The total clearance (CL/f) and renal clearance
(CLR) of rivaroxaban, the amount of drug excreted via the
urine (Aeur), and creatinine clearance (CrCl), were also
assessed.
Pharmacodynamic Sampling and Analysis
Blood samples for the pharmacodynamic analysis of
rivaroxaban were collected at the time of study drug
administration and 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours,
4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 15 hours, 24 hours,
36 hours, and 48 hours thereafter. Pharmacodynamic
250 The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology / Vol 53 No 3 (2013)
effects of rivaroxaban were assessed by determination
of inhibition of Factor Xa activity and prothrombin
time (PT). Factor Xa activity was measured using a twostep
photometric assay: Factor X in plasma was activated
to Factor Xa by RussellÍs viper venom in the presence of
calcium ions; the chromogenic substrate Z_D_Arg_Gly_
Arg_pNA (S_2765; Chromogenix, Milan, Italy) was then
hydrolyzed by Factor Xa, releasing pNA (p_nitroaniline),
which was quantified by photometry at 405 nm. All
standards and controls were prepared from the 3rd
International Standard Coagulation Factors II and X
Concentrate, Human, 98/590 (National Institute for
Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, UK).
The lower limit of quantification for Factor Xa activity was
0.1 IU/mL; activities above this were determined with a
precision of 9.5_14.0% and an accuracy of 99.5_114.0%.
The PT was measured with the use of a ball coagulometer
(KC 10; Amelung, Lemgo, Germany), in accordance with
the manufacturerÍs instructions, using freeze_dried thromboplastin
from rabbit brain (Neoplastin Plus¬; Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).
Factor Xa activity and PT values at the time of study
drug administration (time 0) were designated as baseline;
values after drug administration were expressed as median
percentage inhibition and ñtimes baselineî for Factor Xa
activity and PT, respectively. Non_compartmental kinetic
parameters for dynamic variables (area under the effect_
time curve from the first to last reading [AUC0 tn] and
the maximum effect [Emax]) were calculated from baseline
values. In addition, the effects of rivaroxaban on the
activated partial thromboplastin time and HepTest
were also determined (data not shown).
Statistical Analysis
The effects of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban were determined using
an exploratory analysis of variance (ANOVA; including
the factors old/young and male/female and their interaction),
with least squares (LS)_means values calculated.
Analysis was performed on log_transformed values of the
following parameters: AUC and Cmax of rivaroxaban,
Emax and AUC0 tn for inhibition of Factor Xa activity and
prolongation of PT. Exploratory 90% confidence intervals
(CIs) for LS_means were calculated by re_transformation
of the logarithmic results.",Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial
14748817,Effect of rifampicin on pravastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.,"Previous work has shown that rifampicin, a potent inducer of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporters, decreased the plasma concentrations of simvastatin acid by more than 90%. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. In a randomised, cross-over two-phase study with a washout of 4 weeks, 10 healthy volunteers received a 5-day pretreatment with rifampicin (600 mg daily) or placebo. On day 6, a single 40 mg dose of pravastatin was administered orally. Plasma concentrations of pravastatin were measured up to 12 h by a sensitive LC-MS-MS method. During the rifampicin phase, the mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of pravastatin [AUC(0-infinity )] was 69% (range 24-220%) of the corresponding value during the placebo phase (P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval for the difference -51.9 - -0.4 ng ml-1.h). In five of the 10 subjects the AUC(0-infinity ) of pravastatin during the rifampicin phase was 50% or less of that during the placebo phase. Rifampicin had no significant effect on the peak concentration, elimination half-life or renal clearance of pravastatin. Rifampicin caused a statistically significant decrease in the plasma concentration of pravastatin given as a single oral dose to healthy subjects. However, the effect of rifampicin varied greatly between subjects. The mean rifampicin-induced decrease in pravastatin concentration was considerably smaller than that observed previously for simvastatin.","Methods
Subjects
Ten healthy nonsmoking volunteers (age range, 19_25 years; weight range, 52_103 kg) participated in the study (Table 1) after giving their written informed consent. The subjects were ascertained to be healthy by a medical history, a physical examination, and routine blood chemistry tests before they entered the study. None of the subjects used oral contraceptives or other continuous medications. The sample size was chosen so that a possible clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interaction can be verified statistically without the use of an unnecessarily large group of healthy subjects. The statistical power was estimated to be sufficient to detect a 50% change in the AUC of pravastatin with a power of 80% (alpha-level 5%). Study design
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Studies in Healthy Subjects, Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, and the Finnish National Agency for Medicines. A randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design with 2 phases was used. The wash-out period between the phases was 4 weeks. Subjects were given either 600 mg rifampicin (Rifarm, Pharmacal, Helsinki, Finland) or matched placebo orally once daily at 4 p.m. for 5 days. On day 6, pravastatin (a single Pravachol 40 mg tablet, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) was administered orally with 150 ml water at 9 AM, that is 17 h after the last dose of rifampicin. The subjects had fasted overnight, and a standard meal was served 3 and 7 h after the administration of pravastatin. Alcohol or strenuous exercise was not allowed for two days and subjects didn't ingest grapefruit juice or other drugs for two weeks before test days. The study design was otherwise identical to our previous rifampicin-simvastatin study [9].

Blood and urine sampling
Blood samples (10 ml each) were drawn from a cannulated forearm vein prior to administration of pravastatin and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h later, and were collected in tubes containing ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA). Plasma was separated within 30 min and stored at _70 ÁC until analysis. Urine was collected cumulatively from 0_12 h after the administration of pravastatin.

Determination of pravastatin
The concentrations of pravastatin in plasma and urine were measured by liquid chromatography-ionspray tandem mass spectrometry with use of the PE SCIEX API 3000 LC/MS/MS system (Sciex Division of MDS Inc, Toronto, Canada) as described previously [18]. The ion transition monitored was m/z 442 to m/z 269, and the limit of quantification was 0.25 ng ml_1. The day-to-day coefficients of variation (CV) were 9.0% at 1 ng ml_1, 2.6% at 10 ng ml_1 and 3.3% at 100 ng ml_1 (n = 7) replicates.

Pharmacokinetic analysis
Cmax and tmax were taken directly from the original data. The terminal log-linear phase of the plasma concentration-time curve was identified visually for each curve. The elimination rate constant (ke) was determined by a linear regression analysis using the last 3_8 points on the plot of the natural logarithm of the plasma concentration-time curve. The t1/2 was calculated from the equation t1/2 = ln2/ke. AUC values were calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule for the rising phase and the log-linear trapezoidal rule for the descending phase, with extrapolation to infinity, when appropriate, by dividing the last measured concentration by ke. The renal clearance (CLrenal 0_12 h) of pravastatin was calculated from CLrenal 0_12 h = Ae/AUC(0_12), where Ae is the amount of pravastatin excreted into urine within 12 h.

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean values (± s.d.) in text and tables and, for clarity, as mean values (± s.e.mean) in the figures. 95% confidence intervals were calculated on the mean differences between the placebo and rifampicin phases for AUC(0_¡), Cmax and t1/2. Statistical comparisons of the pharmacokinetic variables (except tmax) were carried out by the Student t-test for paired values (two-tailed), and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for analysis of tmax. Logarithmic transformation of Cmax and AUC values was done before statistical analysis. The Mann_Whitney U-test was used to compare the effect of rifampicin on the AUC(0_¡) of pravastatin and simvastatin acid [9]. The analysis was performed with Systat for Windows, V6.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill). The level of statistical significance was P <0.05.",DDI Randomized clinical trials
16198652,Rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics in white and Asian subjects residing in the same environment.,"Systemic exposure to rosuvastatin had been observed to be approximately 2-fold higher in Japanese subjects living in Japan compared with white subjects in Western Europe or the United States. The organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 contributes to the hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin. Polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 gene can lead to reduced transport function in vitro (T 521>C). This study was conducted to determine whether the pharmacokinetic differences between Japanese and white subjects extended to other Asian ethnic groups and to determine whether polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 gene contribute to any pharmacokinetic differences observed. Rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics was studied in an open-label, parallel-group, single-oral dose (40 mg) study in 36 white, 36 Chinese, 35 Malay, and 35 Asian-Indian subjects living in Singapore, Singapore. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin and metabolites were determined by HPLC-mass spectrophotometry. Two SLCO1B1 polymorphisms (A 388>G and T 521>C) were genotyped. Ratios for rosuvastatin area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration were 2.31, 1.91, and 1.63 and ratios for maximum plasma concentration were 2.36, 2.00, and 1.68 in Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indian subjects, respectively, compared with white subjects. Similar increases in exposure to N-desmethyl rosuvastatin and rosuvastatin-lactone were observed. SLCO1B1 genotypes did not account for the observed pharmacokinetic differences between Asians and white subjects. Plasma exposure to rosuvastatin and its metabolites was significantly higher in Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indian subjects compared with white subjects living in the same environment.","METHODS
Human pharmacokinetic trial
Subjects. Subjects were healthy white, Chinese, Malay,
and Asian-Indian volunteers identified from their
medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram,
clinical chemical, and urinalysis findings. Race
and ethnic group were self-reported by the volunteers
for both parents and all 4 grandparents. For Singaporean
Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indians, the ethnic
group as defined by National Registration Identity
Cards provided additional confirmation of ethnicity.
One hundred forty-one volunteers entered and completed
the trial; all gave informed consent. There were
106 men and 35 women who participated in this study.
In white subjects, gender has no significant effect on
rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics; therefore no effort was
made to balance the study with respect to gender.18

Trial design. The trial (AstraZeneca Trial 4522IL/
0101) was designed and monitored in accordance with
Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration
of Helsinki. The trial was carried out at 2 centers in
Singapore, Singapore (National University Hospital
and Changi General Hospital), after protocol approval
by their institutional review boards. Volunteers were
recruited from the Singapore metropolitan area. White
subjects were required to have resided in Singapore for
at least 6 months before participation in the trial. Asian
subjects were permanent residents of the region.
The trial was an open-label, parallel-group, singledose
study. Volunteers fasted for 8 hours before and 4
hours after administration of a single oral 40-mg dose
of rosuvastatin on day 1. They were required to refrain
from strenuous exercise, smoking, caffeine-containing
drinks and food, alcohol, grapefruit-containing products,
and other medications.
To reduce potential dietary influences on rosuvastatin
exposure, dietary histories of the subjects were
assessed before entry into the study. Subjects on extreme
diets such as weight reduction diets were excluded.
Subjects with diets in which the percent saturated fat
content was less than 10% and daily cholesterol intake
was less than 300 mg were also excluded. The intent
was to have all subjects on similar diets at the time of
dosing. Each subject recorded his or her food intake in
a diary for 3 days before rosuvastatin administration.
The diet diary records were analyzed with Dietplan5
(Forestfield Software, Horsham, United Kingdom), a
validated nutrition analysis software program. Dietary
parameters, estimated as the mean of the 3-day evaluation,
included daily caloric intake; fraction of caloric
intake as protein, carbohydrate, and fat; and daily cholesterol
intake.
Blood sampling. Venous blood samples (7 mL) for
rosuvastatin, N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, and rosuvastatinlactone
assays were taken before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 30, 48, 72, and 96 hours after
rosuvastatin administration. Samples were collected into
tubes containing lithium-heparin anticoagulant and centrifuged
within 30 minutes; plasma was then harvested and
mixed 1:1 with sodium acetate buffer, 0.1 mol/L (pH 4.0),
and stored at  70ÁC until assay.
Determination of plasma rosuvastatin, N-desmethyl
rosuvastatin, and rosuvastatin-lactone concentrations.
Plasma samples were analyzed for rosuvastatin,
N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, and rosuvastatin-lactone by
use of a method (HPLC with mass spectrometric detection)
developed and validated at AstraZeneca, Wilmington,
Del (data on file). A robotic liquid-handling
system was used to perform the sample preparation in
a 96-well format. Plasma proteins were precipitated via
simple protein precipitation and filtration. Analysis of
the filtrate was accomplished by multiple-reaction
monitoring via positive electrospray ionization_tandem
mass spectrometric detection.
The lower limit of quantitation for rosuvastatin was
0.100 ng/mL; the upper limit was 100 ng/mL but was
extended by dilution. The lower limit of quantitation
for N-desmethyl rosuvastatin and rosuvastatin-lactone
was 0.250 ng/mL; the upper limit was 25.0 ng/mL.
The accuracy and precision of the analytic method
were ensured on the basis of the results for spiked
quality control samples, which were assayed on each
day of trial analysis. For rosuvastatin, accuracy averaged
101% (7.3% relative SD [RSD]) at 0.750 ng/mL,
97.0% (3.9% RSD) at 7.5 ng/mL, and 96.1% (3.4%
RSD) at 25 ng/mL. For N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, accuracy
averaged 102% (6.5% RSD) at 0.750 ng/mL,
95.6% (4.1% RSD) at 7.50 ng/mL, and 99.3% (4.1%
RSD) at 15 ng/mL. For rosuvastatin-lactone, accuracy
averaged 97.1% (9.6% RSD) at 0.750 ng/mL, 98.3%
(7.7% RSD) at 7.50 ng/mL, and 97.5% (8.2% RSD) at
15 ng/mL.
Pharmacokinetic evaluation. The primary pharmacokinetic
parameter of this trial was the area under the
plasma concentration_time curve (AUC) or, if fewer
than 29 subjects per ethnic group had estimable AUC
values, the AUC from time 0 to the time of the last
quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t). Other pharmacokinetic
parameters included maximum plasma concentration
(Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), and terminal elimination
half-life (t_) of rosuvastatin and AUC0-t, Cmax,
and t_ of N-desmethyl rosuvastatin and rosuvastatinlactone.
The apparent terminal half-life was calculated
as 0.693/ z, where  z is the terminal elimination rate
constant calculated by log-linear regression of the terminal
portion of the plasma concentration_time curve. AUC0-t
was determined by use of the linear trapezoidal rule, and
AUC was determined as AUC0-t   Clast/ z (where Clast is
the last measurable plasma concentration).
Genotyping of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from
blood samples by use of the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). SLCO1B1 polymorphisms
A388 G and T521 C were genotyped by use
of TaqMan MGB technology, marketed as Assays-by-

ALPS 300 sealer (ABgene) with Clear Seal Strong
(ABgene) and cycled in a DT-108 Super-Duncan water
bath cycler (KBiosystems, Basildon, United Kingdom).
The cycling conditions were 92ÁC for 10 minutes (92ÁC
for 15 seconds and 57ÁC for 1 minute)  45 cycles.
After PCR, FAM, VIC, and ROX fluorescence intensities
were measured in an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). Cluster analysis
was performed manually.
Statistical methods. Differences in diet (total daily
caloric intake, daily cholesterol intake, and total fat,
saturated fat, carbohydrate, and protein as a percent of
total calories) were analyzed by ANOVA and results
given as the least squares mean difference and 90%
confidence interval (CI) between each Asian ethnic
group and the white group.
Summary statistics for AUC0-t and Cmax are presented
as geometric means and 95% CIs. Half-life
values are shown as least square means and SEs, and
tmax values are given as mean, median, and range.
Three primary comparisons of rosuvastatin AUC0-t
were made as follows: Chinese versus white subjects,
Asian-Indian versus white subjects, and Malay versus
white subjects. A sample comprising 29 volunteers per
ethnic group had greater than 90% power to ensure that
the 90% CI for the ratio of AUC0-t for each of the 3
comparisons would be contained within the interval 0.7
to 1.43, with the assumption that the true underlying
ratio was 1. No adjustment for multiple comparisons
was made.
Rosuvastatin AUC0-t was log-transformed before
analysis. ANOVA was used to determine geometric
mean ratios and 90% CIs for each Asian group versus
the white group. Rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC0-t and
Cmax for N-desmethyl rosuvastatin and rosuvastatinlactone
were analyzed in a similar manner. Rosuvastatin
and metabolite half-lives (untransformed) were analyzed
by ANOVA, and results are given as the least
squares mean difference and 90% CI between each
Asian ethnic group and the white group.
In contrast to the pharmacokinetic analyses, all pharmacogenetic
analyses were post hoc and hence exploratory.
Chi-square analysis was used to test for Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each SNP within
each population. SLCO1B1 haplotypes were assigned
by use of an expectation maximization method as implemented
in the software package SNPHAP.19 The
pharmacokinetic measurements AUC0-t and Cmax of
rosuvastatin were log-transformed before analysis, and
summary statistics reported are the geometric means
and 95% CIs. The effects of the T521 C and A388 G
SNPs and of SLCO1B1 diplotypes on log-transformed
Cmax and AUC0-t were examined by ANOVA. Tukey-
Kramer analysis was used to locate nominally significant
genotypic and diplotypic differences within each
ethnic group for     .05.
Tolerability. Adverse event reports, medical examinations,
and clinical laboratory data were assessed to
evaluate tolerability.",Genotyped PK Trial
16101667,Not all statins interfere with clopidogrel during antiplatelet therapy.,"Clopidogrel and statins are frequently coadministered in patients with ischemic heart diseases. Recent reports suggested that clopidogrel's effectiveness in inhibiting adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelets aggregation is attenuated by co-administration of certain statins. The objective of the present study was to define which statin might interfere with the antiaggregation property of clopidogrel. We designed a pharmacokinetic study and tested ex vivo platelet function on 21 healthy volunteers who received clopidogrel and all currently commercially available statins: rosuvastatin [10 mg o.d.], simvastatin [20 mg o.d.], fluvastatin [80 mg o.d.], pravastatin [40 mg o.d.], and atorvastatin [20 mg o.d.]. Each statin was administered for 7 days followed by 1 week of wash-out period with clopidogrel treatment alone. Detection of the statins in the plasma was performed on all blood samples, using HPLC analytical method. All individuals, except one, were responders to clopidogrel with inhibition of ex vivo ADP induced platelet aggregation. All statins, except pravastatin, were detectable in the plasma at the end of each treatment period in all patients, and no statin was detectable after any of the wash-out periods. Clopidogrel was significantly less efficient to prevent platelet aggregation when coadministrated with simvastatin or fluvastatin. No difference was observed in clopidogrel efficacy when coadministered with rosuvastatin, pravastatin or atorvastatin. This is the first study investigating clopidogrel-statin interactions on ex vivo platelet function with all commercially available statins and which were administered to the same individuals. It demonstrates in healthy volunteers that at the doses used in this study, simvastatin and fluvastatin, but not atorvastatin, pravastatin or rosuvastatin interfere with the anti-aggregation effect of clopidogrel.","Methods
Subjects
Participants were 21 healthy volunteers (mean age 25
±
5 years) who received an oral dose of clopidogrel [75 mg d
_
1
]
during the entire study period (10 weeks). The participants
enrolled had no history of drug or alcohol abuse or liver disease,
no history of bleeding diathesis, a normal prothrombin
time, platelet count and serum creatinine. After the first
week of clopidogrel treatment, all participants received
successively, in the same order, the statins rosuvastatin
(10 mg o.d.), simvastatin (20 mg o.d.), fluvastatin (80 mg
o.d.), pravastatin (40 mg o.d.), and atorvastatin (20 mg
o.d.). Each statin was administered for 7 days followed by
1 week of washout period with clopidogrel treatment alone.
These statin doses were chosen based on most of recent clinical
trials, and are the common doses of statin used in clinical
practice. To follow good clinical practice, clopidogrel was
administered in the morning and statins at bedtime.
The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, and
was approved by the local institutional ethical committee,
and written informed consent was obtained from each
participant. This study was not financially sponsored, directly
or indirectly, by any pharmaceutical company.
Platelet aggregometry
Blood samples were withdrawn at the beginning (baseline
without any treatment) and at the end of each week of
the study period, always at the same time in the morning
(between 7‡30 and 8‡30 h) using standard procedures. The
first 2 mL were discarded. Samples were centrifuged for
10 min at 150
g
(20
Á
C) to obtain platelet-rich plasma
(PRP). The remaining blood was further centrifuged again
at 3500
g
for 10 min to obtain platelet poor plasma (PPP).
The platelet count of the PRP was then adjusted to 250 G/L
with autologous PPP. Platelet aggregation tests were performed
with an APACT-4 aggregometer (Labor Fibrintimer,
Ahrensburg, Germany). Adjusted PRP was challenged
with 2 ADP concentrations, 5 and 10

(Endotell,
Allschwil, Switzerland), as previously reported [8,9].
Determination of statin plasma
Detection of each statin in the plasma was performed on
all blood samples, using HPLC (high performance liquid

In this open-label two-way crossover trial 24 healthy adult volunteers were randomized to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg orally each morning (07.00 h) or evening (18.00 h) for 14 days. After a 4 week washout period, volunteers received the alternative regimen for 14 days. Rosuvastatin was administered in the absence of food. Reductions from baseline in serum concentrations of LDL-C (-41.3%[morning]vs-44.2%[evening]), total cholesterol (-30.9%vs-31.8%), triglycerides (-17.1%vs-22.7%), and apolipoprotein B (-32.4%vs-35.3%) were similar following morning and evening administration. AUC(0,24 h) for plasma mevalonic acid (MVA), an in vivo marker of HMG-CoA reductase activity, decreased by -29.9% (morning) vs-32.6% (evening). Urinary excretion of MVA declined by -33.6% (morning) vs-29.2% (evening). The steady-state pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin were very similar following the morning and evening dosing regimens. The Cmax values were 4.58 vs 4.54 ng ml-1, and AUC(0,24 h) values were 40.1 vs 42.7 ng ml-1 h, following morning and evening administration, respectively. There were no serious adverse events during the trial, and rosuvastatin was well tolerated after morning and evening administration. The pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin are not dependent on time of dosing. Morning or evening administration is equally effective in lowering LDL-C.","Methods
Twenty-four healthy adult volunteers (22 men and 2 women), ranging in age from 19 to 61 years (mean 38.6 years) and weighing 57_100 kg (mean 76.9 kg), were enrolled in this trial. Of these, 21 were Caucasian, 2 were Hispanic, and 1 was Black.

Screening assessments included a complete medical history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and standard laboratory tests. All volunteers had fasting serum LDL-C concentrations < 4.14 mmol l_1 and fasting serum TG concentrations _ 3.39 mmol l_1. Clinical chemistry (including hepatic function) tests were within reference ranges. Each volunteer provided written in-formed consent prior to enrolment.

Trial design
This open-label, randomized, two-way crossover trial comprised two 14 day treatment periods separated by a 4 week washout period. Dietary assessments were made during a pre-treatment screening period of 21_30 days, and dietary regimens were developed to stabilize individual calorie and fat intake during the trial (thereby minimizing potential dietary effects on lipid levels). Volunteers entered the clinic 2 days before treatment began and remained there for each 14 day treatment period and for a 4 day follow-up period.

Eligible volunteers were randomized to receive a single oral dose of rosuvastatin (10 mg) each morning (approximately 07.00 h) or evening (approximately 18.00 h) for 14 days. After the washout period volunteers received the alternative (morning or evening) treatment regimen for a further 14 days. The trial medication was administered with 240 ml of water. Volunteers were required to fast for a minimum of 2 h before and after each rosuvastatin dose, and for at least 12 h (overnight) before collection of blood samples for lipid analyses.

The trial was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board of Covance in Madison, Wisconsin, USA approved the trial protocol.

Pharmacodynamic evaluations
Blood samples (10 ml) were collected for determination of fasting serum lipid concentrations before administration of the morning dose of rosuvastatin (morning dosing) or before the morning meal (evening dosing). Serum LDL-C (the primary parameter of this trial), TC, TG, HDL-C, apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) concentrations were determined at screening (days _21 and _1), on treatment days 1, 7, 13, and 14, at follow-up (days 1 and 4 post-treatment), and at weekly intervals during the washout period. Serum samples were stored at _20 ÁC prior to analysis, which was conducted at a central laboratory (Covance Laboratories, Indiana, USA). LDL-C concentrations were calculated using the Friedewald formula [21]. TC and TG were measured by colorimetric enzymatic assay (using a Hitachi 747 automatic analyser). HDL-C was measured after precipitation by colorimetric enzymatic assay. ApoA-I and ApoB were measured by nephelometry.

During each treatment period, plasma concentrations of mevalonic acid (MVA). an in vivo marker of HMG-CoA reductase activity, were measured at baseline (day _1), on treatment days 1 and 14, and at follow-up (day 1 post-treatment). In addition, urinary MVA excretion was determined over a 24 h period before the first dose and after the final dose of rosuvastatin in each treatment period. Heparinized plasma samples and urine samples were stored at _70 ÁC prior to analysis. The analysis of plasma MVA concentrations was performed using a validated h.p.l.c./MS/MS [22] method at Covance Laboratories, Harrogate, UK. Correlation coefficients for plasma MVA were 0.991_1.00. Mean accuracy levels for quality control samples (at all concentrations) were 99.7_106.7%; mean imprecision values were 7.2_10.9%. The limit of quantification for plasma MVA in this trial was 0.2 ng ml_1. The analysis of urine MVA concentrations was performed using a validated GC/MS assay [23] at AstraZeneca's Central Toxicology Laboratory, Alderley Park, Cheshire, UK. Correlation coefficients for urine MVA were 0.993_1.00. Mean accuracy levels for quality control samples (at all concentrations) were 86.6_103%. The limit of quantification for urine MVA in this trial was 9.0 ng ml_1.

Pharmacokinetics
Serial venous blood samples (7 ml) for determination of plasma rosuvastatin concentrations were collected at 0.5 h predose and at fixed intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h) after administration of rosuvastatin on treatment day 14. Blood samples were also collected at 0.5 h pre-dose on treatment days 2, 3, 7, 8, and 13 to assess whether pharmacokinetic steady state had been attained. Heparinized blood samples were centrifuged at 1500_2500 rev min_1 for 10 min. The derived plasma samples were diluted 1 : 1 with 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and stored at _70 ÁC prior to analysis. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were determined using a validated h.p.l.c./MS assay [24] at Quintiles, Edinburgh, UK. Correlation coefficients for rosuvastatin were 0.994_1.00. Mean inaccuracy levels and imprecision values for quality control samples (at all concentrations) were _ 7% and < 8%, respectively. The limit of quantification for rosuvastatin in this trial was 0.2 ng ml_1.

Plasma rosuvastatin concentration-time data were analysed by standard noncompartmental pharmacokinetic methods. The following parameters were determined: maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h (AUC(0,24 h)), AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC(0,¡)), and the plasma terminal elimination half-life (t1/2). AUC was estimated using the linear trapezoidal method, with extrapolation from the last quantifiable data point using the terminal slope of the plasma concentration-time profile. The terminal elimination rate constant (_z) was derived by log-linear regression of the terminal portion of the plasma concentration-time profile, and t1/2 was calculated as ln2/_z.

Safety and tolerability assessments
Safety and tolerability were assessed from routine laboratory tests, haemodynamic monitoring, and clinical adverse event records.

Statistical analysis
Sample size estimates showed that 16 volunteers would be required in order to provide 80% power to detect an absolute treatment difference (morning-evening) of 10% in mean percent reduction in LDL-C concentration. Assuming a trial discontinuation rate of 33%, 24 volunteers were required for enrollment.

For morning vs evening comparisons of lipid parameters, MVA concentrations, and pharmacokinetic parameters an analysis of variance (anova) model was used (with effects for treatment sequence, volunteer-within-treatment sequence, treatment group, and period). Mean percent changes in lipid parameters from baseline were compared using least square means generated by anova of lipid parameters and expressed as morning-evening differences with 90% confidence intervals (CIs). Mean percent change in MVA concentrations from baseline were compared using least square geometric means generated by anova of plasma MVA AUC(0,24 h) and urinary excretion of MVA and expressed as morning-evening differences with 90% CIs. Plasma rosuvastatin exposure was compared using least square geometric means generated by anova of log-transformed rosuvastatin AUC(0,24 h) and Cmax values and expressed as morning/evening ratios with 90% CIs.",Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial
22472908,"Comparison of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of a single oral dose of pitavastatin 4 mg in adult subjects with severe renal impairment not on hemodialysis versus healthy adult subjects.","Pitavastatin is a novel statin recently approved in the United States as an adjunctive therapy with diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This open-label study enrolled 16 subjects as follows: group A: 8 adult subjects with severe renal impairment who were not on hemodialysis (estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2) and group B: 8 healthy adult subjects (estimated glomerular filtration rate _80 mL/min/1.73 m2). On day 1, the subjects received a single oral dose of pitavastatin 4 mg and remained in the clinic on days 1-3 for safety and pharmacokinetic assessments. Comparing group A with group B, the geometric mean ratio of AUC(0-inf) for pitavastatin was 1.36 (90% confidence interval, 0.88-2.11). For Cmax, the corresponding ratio was 1.18 (90% confidence interval, 0.68-2.02). There were no severe treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, deaths, or treatment-emergent AEs leading to study drug discontinuation. A single dose of pitavastatin 4 mg was safe and well tolerated by the subjects in this study with severe renal impairment, who were not on hemodialysis.","METHODS
All clinical trial subjects provided written informed
consent before study procedures. This study was approved
by an independent Investigational Review Board (Western
Institutional Review Board, Olympia, Washington) and
conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration
of Helsinki and Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.
This was a phase 4, single-center, open-label, 1-period
study. Sixteen subjects were enrolled for participation (8 subjects
each in groups A and B) as follows:
´ Group A: The subjects with severe renal impairment not
receiving hemodialysis (eGFR of 15_29 mL/min/1.73 m2,
inclusive) based on the modification of diet in renal disease
(MDRD) equation (eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 ‡
(serum creatinine)_1.154 ‡ (age)_0.203 ‡ (0.742 if female) ‡
(1.210 if African American).
´ Group B: Healthy subjects with unimpaired renal function
(eGFR $80 mL/min/1.73 m2) based on the MDRD equation.
Although eGFR $90 mL/min/1.73.m2 would normally
be considered ñhealthy,î discussion with the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) led to some modification
of the range eGFR for healthy subjects to facilitate enrollment
for this study. In addition, a previous pitavastatin
analysis conducted in Europe had used an eGFR of
$80 mL/min/1.73 m2 as cutoff for healthy subjects (data
on file); therefore, using these criteria made these study
designs more aligned.
Each volunteer qualified for entry into the study not
.30 days before admission into the clinic. The subjects
checked into the clinic on day 21 for baseline assessments.
On the morning of day 1, the subjects received a single oral
dose of pitavastatin 4 mg (1 tablet) under fasting conditions.
The duration of the study was 3 days. From November 2009
to June 2010, 16 subjects were enrolled at 1 study site, and
16 subjects completed the study. All 16 subjects were included
in the PK and safety statistical analyses. Formal power
calculations were not performed before study initiation; however,
similar analyses have been reported with comparable
subject numbers for safety and tolerability focused studies
in renally impaired subjects.21,22
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Male or female subjects .18 years of age were eligible.
The subjects with severe renal impairment not treated with
hemodialysis (group A) was defined as having an eGFR of
15_29 mL/min/1.73 m2 and stable renal impairment as judged
by the investigator. Group B subjects were defined as healthy
males or females with unimpaired renal function (an eGFR an
eGFR $80 mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated by the MDRD

Blood Draws, Urine Samples, and Pitavastatin
and Metabolite Measurement
Serial blood samples for PK assessments of pitavastatin
and pitavastatin lactone were collected before dosing (0 hour)
and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, and
48 hours after dosing. Urine samples for PK assessments of
pitavastatin and pitavastatin lactone were collected at the
following intervals: before dosing, 0_12, 12_24, 24_36, and
36_48 hours after dosing. Protein binding of pitavastatin was
assessed by equilibrium dialysis using samples of venous
blood (16 mL) collected in sodium heparin tubes 1 hour
before dosing with pitavastatin on day 1. Plasma concentrations
of pitavastatin and its lactone metabolite, pitavastatin
lactone (for PK analysis), were measured by Eurofins ADME
BIOANALYSES (Vergeze, France).
Pitavastatin and pitavastatin lactone metabolite in plasma
were assayed according to an analytical method using liquid_
liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether, followed by a liquid
chromatography_tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the
extracts. The lower limit of quantitation was 1 ng, and the upper
limit of quantitation was 200 ng. Concentrations were calculated
using the area ratio of analytes to internal standard. The calibration
curve was calculated from the linear regression of the
response using a 1/x weighting factor. Interrun and intrarun
assays for pitavastatin had a precision of 5.0% with 100.0%
accuracy and a precision of 6.1% with 98.0% accuracy, respectively.
Interrun and intrarun assay numbers for the lactone
metabolite had a precision of 7.2% with 97.0% accuracy and
a precision of 4.4% with 91.0% accuracy, respectively.
Pharmacokinetic and Statistical Analysis
PK parameters were calculated using WinNonlin Professional,
Version 5.1.1 or higher (Pharsight, St Louis, MO).
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software,
Version 9.1.3 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The
plasma concentration versus time data for pitavastatin and
pitavastatin lactone were analyzed by noncompartmental
analysis. Values that were below the lower limit of quantitation
(BLQ) were set equal to 0 for the summary statistics. For
calculation of PK parameters, BLQ values were set to 0 unless
the BLQ value was between 2 measurable concentrations. In
this case, the BLQ value was set to missing.
An analysis of variance was performed on the logtransformed
parameters maximum observed plasma concentration
(Cmax), area under the concentration_time curve from
zero to time t (AUC0_t), and AUC from zero to infinity
(AUC0_inf) for pitavastatin and pitavastatin lactone. The
model included group A and group B as a fixed effect. For
pitavastatin and pitavastatin lactone, the association between
PK results and renal function was evaluated, and linear
regression was performed on the log-transformed parameters
Cmax, AUC0_t, and AUC0_inf versus eGFR using both the
MDRD study equation and versus creatinine clearance using
the Cockroft_Gault equation.23

18307374,"Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor--in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.","There is a clinical need for novel oral anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Rivaroxaban is an oral direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. This analysis was performed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in patients participating in two phase II, double-blind, randomized, active-comparator-controlled studies of twice-daily rivaroxaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total hip- or knee-replacement surgery. Sparse blood samples were taken from all patients participating in the studies (n = 1009). In addition, a subset of patients in the hip study (n = 36) underwent full profiling. Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations, FXa activity and the prothrombin time were determined. Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling was used to model the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. An oral one-compartment model described the population pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban well. On the first postoperative day only, categorization of patients as slow or fast absorbers as a tool to address variability in absorption improved the fit of the model. Clearance of rivaroxaban was lower and more variable on the first postoperative day, and so time was factored into the model. Overall, the only major difference between the models for the hip study and the knee study was that clearance was 26% lower in the knee study, resulting in approximately 30% higher exposure. Residual variability in the models was moderate (37% and 34% in the hip and knee studies, respectively). Plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban increased dose dependently. Pharmacokinetic parameters that were estimated using the models agreed closely with results from full-profile patients in the hip study, demonstrating that rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are predictable. The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were affected by expected covariates: age affected clearance in the hip study only, haematocrit (on the first postoperative day only) and gender affected clearance in the knee study only, and renal function affected clearance in both studies. Bodyweight affected the volume of distribution in both studies. However, the effects of covariates on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were generally small, and predictions of 'extreme' case scenarios suggested that fixed dosing of rivaroxaban was likely to be possible. FXa activity and the prothrombin time were both affected by surgery, probably because of perioperative bleeding and intravenous administration of fluids; therefore, time was included in the pharmacodynamic models. In both studies, FXa activity correlated with rivaroxaban plasma concentrations following a maximum effect model, whereas prothrombin time prolongation correlated following a linear model with intercept. The slope of the prothrombin time prolongation correlation was 3.2 seconds/(100 microg/L) in the hip study and 4.2 seconds/(100 microg/L) in the knee study. Both pharmacodynamic models in both studies demonstrated low residual variability of approximately 10%. This population analysis in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery demonstrated that rivaroxaban has predictable, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics that were well described by an oral one-compartment model and affected by expected covariates. Rivaroxaban exposure could be assessed using the prothrombin time, if necessary, but not the international normalized ratio. The findings suggested that fixed dosing of rivaroxaban may be possible in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.","Methods

21895039,Rivaroxaban: population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients treated for acute deep-vein thrombosis and exposure simulations in patients with atrial fibrillation treated for stroke prevention.,"Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor, which is at an advanced stage of clinical development for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Two phase II studies, ODIXa-DVT and EINSTEIN DVT, assessed the efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban (once daily or twice daily) for treatment of acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of rivaroxaban in patients in these two phase II studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban and the relationship between important patient covariates and model parameters. Exposure simulations in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were also performed in order to predict the exposure of rivaroxaban, using modified demographic data reflecting the characteristics of a typical AF population. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using plasma samples from these patients. Various simulations were conducted to explore the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in patients with DVT and to predict exposure in those with AF. Correlations between plasma rivaroxaban concentrations and the prothrombin time, Factor Xa activity, HepTest¬ and activated partial thromboplastin time were also described. The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in patients with DVT were found to be consistent and predictable across all doses studied. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased dose dependently. The same total daily doses given once daily achieved higher maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) values (_20%) and lower trough (minimum) plasma concentration (C(trough)) values (_60%) than when given twice daily; however, the 5th-95th percentile ranges for these parameters overlapped. Rivaroxaban clearance was moderately influenced by age and renal function, and the volume of distribution was influenced by age, body weight and sex; the effects were within the observed interindividual variability. Simulations in virtual patient populations with AF showed that a rivaroxaban dose of 15_mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance of 30-49_mL/min would achieve AUC and C(max) values similar to those observed with 20_mg once daily in patients with normal renal function. The prothrombin time correlated almost linearly with plasma rivaroxaban concentrations (_500__g/L). Population analyses of phase II clinical data indicated that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of all rivaroxaban doses were predictable and were affected by expected demographic factors in patients with acute DVT.","Methods
Studies Included in the Analyses
The ODIXa-DVT (Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor BAY
59-7939 in Patients with Acute Symptomatic Deep-Vein
Thrombosis) study[18] and the EINSTEIN DVT study[19] were
dose-ranging, randomized, comparator-controlled studies,
which assessed the efficacy and safety of a variety of rivaroxaban
regimens for treatment of acute DVT. A total of 1156 patients
with confirmed acute, symptomatic, proximal DVT
were enrolled. Key exclusion criteria were body weight £45 kg
(ODIXa-DVT only[18]), severe renal impairment (calculated
creatinine clearance [CLCR] <30mL/min or a serum creatinine
level [SCR] >1.5 ‡ the upper limit of normal [ULN]), severe
hepatic impairment (transaminases >2 ‡ ULN) and systemic
treatment with azole compounds or other strong CYP3A4
inhibitors. Patients were randomized to receive either doubleblind
rivaroxaban or open-label standard therapy. The studies
evaluated different dosing regimens. Patients in ODIXa-DVT[18]
received rivaroxaban 10, 20 or 30mg twice daily; 40mg once daily;
or standard therapy. Patients in EINSTEIN DVT received rivaroxaban
20, 30 or 40mg once daily; or standard therapy. The
treatment duration was 12 weeks in both studies.
Sparse blood samples were taken from patients in both
studies shortly after the start of treatment and at steady state.
This technique was chosen because it was not considered realistic
for outpatients to return to hospital at frequent intervals
over the 3-month period. The sampling regimen for ODIXa-
DVT[18] was as follows: on study day 1 or day 2, blood samples
were taken 1, 3 and 6 hours after dosing and in the time interval
between 8 hours after dosing and the second daily dose (i.e.
8_12 hours after the first dose) before the next dose was given.
Samples were taken on day 2 only when patients had not started
the study medication before 10:00 on day 1 and were only administered
the evening dose. On study day 21, blood samples were
taken 1 hour before morning dosing and 1, 3 and 6 hours after
dosing. In EINSTEIN DVT, baseline samples were collected before
randomization on study day 1 and then 2_6 hours after the
first dose of rivaroxaban. In addition, on study day 43, a sample
was taken immediately before the next dose, and on study day 84,
a sample was taken 2_6 hours after the last rivaroxaban dose.

USA) were determined in the same laboratory, using methods
described previously.[10] The PT was determined according to
standard procedures at a central laboratory using STA 
Neoplastine  (Diagnostica Stago, Asnie`res sur Seine, France)
with an international sensitivity index of 1.82_1.85 and was
used in the pharmacodynamic investigation.
Population Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic
Modelling
Because of the lack of rich pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
data, a population-modelling approach, based on the data from
the sparse sampling, was used. This analysis provides estimates
of population mean values and descriptions of the variability
inherent in a population. In addition, sources of variability, such
as patient covariates, can be assessed, and post hoc empirical
Bayes estimates allow for prediction of individual patient
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters. All modelling
was based on previously developed models derived from the population
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses in healthy
subjects[21] and the ones used to determine the population
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in patients undergoing
total hip replacement.[12,13]
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses
were performed using non-linear mixed-effects modelling
software (NONMEM  Version V Level 1.1; GloboMax LLC,
Hanover, MD, USA) operated in a validated Linux server farm
environment. The first-order conditional estimation with
interaction method was used for all analyses. All statistics and
graphs were generated using S-Plus Version 6 software (Insightful
Corp., Seattle, WA, USA) or SAS Version 8.2 software
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
NONMEM  is a mixed-effects modelling technique used to
quantify random effects, such as unexplained interindividual
variability (IIV) and residual variability, as well as the influence
of measured patient characteristics or covariates (fixed effects)
on basic (structural) model parameters (fixed effects).[22] Therefore,
the developed population models can be viewed as consisting
of three sub-models: a structural sub-model, a statistical
sub-model and a covariate sub-model. The structural pharmacokinetic
or pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic sub-model
describes the structure, using fixed-effects parameters, and the
statistical sub-model accounts for variability, using various levels
of random effects, IIV and residual variability. Exponential
models were used to account for IIV in the structural parameters.
Residual variability was investigated as being additive,
proportional or a combination of both. Local linear relation-

ships were used to link pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters
with potential continuous covariates; the influence of
categorical covariates was expressed as being present/absent.
The pharmacokinetic or pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
model structure was optimized; the goal was to reduce unexplained
variability. Model components were incorporated into
the model if the likelihood ratio test showed a p-value of £0.01
(a change in the objective function value [OFV] of >6.63). The
model component remained in the model if, after backwards
stripping from the full model, the likelihood ratio test showed a
p-value of £0.001 (a change in the OFV of >10.8). In addition to
goodness-of-fit statistics using the likelihood ratio test, goodnessof-
fit graphs were used to evaluate the adequacy of the model.
An oral, one-compartment model was used as the starting
point for the structural pharmacokinetic model, with the clearance
(CL), volume of distribution (Vd) and first-order absorption rate
constant (ka) as parameters.Nodata are currently available on the
absolute bioavailability (F) of rivaroxaban; therefore, F was used
to describe potential differences in the relative bioavailability between
the different dosing regimens. As a result, CL and Vd were
modelled as CL/F and Vd/F, respectively.
The predefined covariates that were evaluated for their influence
on both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic structural models were the effect of time
(visit number); dosage; patient covariates (including age, body
weight, height, body surface area, lean body mass [LBM], body
fat, sex, SCR and CLCR calculated according to the Cockcroft-
Gault formula);[23] and selected concomitant medications (including
opioids, NSAIDs, diuretics and prespecified drugs that
accelerate gastrointestinal passage).
Further selected co-medications, which were being taken
by <10% of subjects _ such as CYP3A4 inducers (rifampicin
[rifampin], carbamazepine, phenobarbital [phenobarbitone],
phenytoin), atorvastatin and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) _
were evaluated for exposure differences between treatment
groups in an exploratory, descriptive manner.
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic structural models
for Factor Xa activity and for the PT, aPTT and HepTest  were
developed from a conventional direct-effect linear model (linear
intercept model) for the PT and a maximum effect (Emax)
model, including a baseline effect for Factor Xa activity, aPTT
and HepTest .
Predictions of Exposure Parameters, Validation
and Simulations
The pharmacokinetic data obtained from the blood samples
taken from patients across both studies were pooled and used
with the population model to estimate the pharmacokinetic
profile of rivaroxaban in the VTE treatment population. Specific
exposure parameters for rivaroxaban, such as the area
under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum
and trough (minimum) plasma concentrations (Cmax and
Ctrough, respectively), were estimated for each individual in both
studies for the dosing regimen that he or she received. Simulations
were conducted to investigate the influence of oncedaily
or twice-daily dosing on rivaroxaban exposure.

patients with body weight at the upper and lower limits of the
population were simulated for both once-daily and twice-daily
doses. The predicted plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban
once daily and twice daily for each typical patient were grouped
demographically and plotted for comparison alongside the
mean plasma concentration for the entire pooled population.
Further simulations were conducted to predict the exposure of
rivaroxaban for the dosing regimen that was selected for the
phase III VTE treatment studies.
Non-parametric bootstraps (n = 1000) were performed on
the original dataset. All pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
parameters were estimated using the respective final models
and analysed via descriptive statistics (see figure S-1 in Supplemental
Digital Content 1, available online at http://links.
adisonline.com/CPZ/A20). Visual predictive checks were conducted
to further investigate the validity of the established
models. Individual empirical Bayesian estimates for pharmacokinetics
and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics were calculated
(via the NONMEM  post hoc procedure) using population
means, variation and individual patient information, by simulating
sub-problems (n = 200). The 5th_95th percentile ranges
were calculated and compared with the observations (see figure
S-2a and S-2b in Supplemental Digital Content 1).
To predict the exposure of rivaroxaban in virtual patient
populations with AF, the DVT treatment population data were
modified to reflect the demographic characteristics of a patient
population with AF. Demographic data from two clinical studies
in AF[24,25] were used to represent a typical AF population.

19701114,Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between carbamazepine and aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia.,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between carbamazepine and aripiprazole were studied in 18 inpatients with schizophrenia being treated with aripiprazole. The daily dose of aripiprazole was 24 mg in 15 cases and 12 mg in 3 cases. Carbamazepine 400 mg/d was coadministered for 1 week, and blood samples were taken twice before the start of carbamazepine coadministration and then 1 week after completion. In addition, on these days, the severity of illness and side effects were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Udvalg for Kliniske UndersÀgelser side effects rating scale, respectively. Plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were measured using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. Carbamazepine significantly decreased both plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole by 64% and 68%, respectively (P < 0.001). Despite these decreases in plasma concentrations, the total and negative scores in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, together with the neurological score in Udvalg for Kliniske UndersÀgelser, decreased slightly but significantly (P < 0.05) after carbamazepine coadministration. The present study implies that carbamazepine augmentation may be effective for patients with schizophrenia treated with aripiprazole, although carbamazepine dramatically decreases plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole, by inducing the metabolism of these compounds.","MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The subjects were 18 Japanese inpatients with schizophrenia
(12 males and 6 females) who fulfilled the criteria for
schizophrenia (undifferentiated type, 9 cases; paranoid type, 4
cases; disorganized type, 3 cases; and catatonic type, 2 cases),
according to the American Psychiatric Association.12 They
were physically healthy without any history of substance
abuse, neurological disorder, delirium, or dementia and
without any clinically significant findings, including a clinical
laboratory examination, electrocardiography, and electroencephalography.
The mean 6 SD of age, body weight, and
duration of illness were 35.8 6 13.2 years, 62.3 6 16.4 kg,
and 79.6 6 82.9 months, respectively. This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of the
Ryukyus, and all patients and their families gave written
informed consent to participate in this study.
Drug Treatment
Before carbamazepine coadministration, the subjects had
received aripiprazole for 3_5 weeks. It has been shown that
plasma concentrations of both aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole
reach steady state by 2 weeks after repeated oral
administration.13 The daily dose was fixed at 24 mg in 15 cases
and 12 mg in 3 cases and was given once a day at 12.30 hours.
The drugs coadministered were biperiden 4 mg/d in 6 cases and
flunitrazepam 1_6 mg/d in 12 cases. Female patients did not
receive oral contraceptives. The doses of these coadministered
drugs were fixed throughout the study period. Carbamazepine
400 mg/d in equally divided doses was coadministered at 08.00
and 20.00 hours to all subjects for 1 week. Blood samples were
taken before the carbamazepine coadministration commenced
and then again 1 week after completion.
Clinical Assessment
On the same day as blood sampling, severity of illness
and side effects were evaluated using the Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale (PANSS)14 and the Udvalg for Kliniske
UndersÀgelser (UKU) side effects rating scale,15 respectively.
Nineteen items were selected from the UKU side effects rating
scale to assess the side effects of aripiprazole,whichwere further
separated into 3 clusters: psychic (concentration difficulties,
asthenia, sleepiness, failing memory, depression, and tension);
neurological (dystonia, rigidity, hypokinesia, hyperkinesia,
tremor, akathisia, and increased salivation); and autonomic
(accommodation disturbances, reduced salivation, constipation,
micturition disturbances, orthostatic dizziness, and palpitations).
Analytical Methods
Plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole
were measured using the liquid chromatography
method with mass spectrometric detection of Kubo et al.16 The
lowest limit of detection for both compounds was 0.1 ng/mL
using 0.4 mL of plasma, and the accuracy for aripiprazole
and dehydroaripiprazole was in the range 23.6% to 5.5%
and 20.6% to 1.6% at all concentrations, respectively.
For the determination of CYP2D6 genotype, DNA was
isolated from peripheral leucocytes using a QIA-amp DNA
Blood Maxi (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan). Long polymerase
chain reaction analysis was used to detect the *5 allele.17 The
*10 and *14 allele were identified as the 100C-T and 1758G-A
mutations using 2-step polymerase chain reaction analyses as
described by Johansson et al18 and Kubota et al,19 respectively.
These mutated alleles and the wild-type allele, which were
regarded as predominant over other CYP2D6 alleles in the
population, were selected based on a previous view on the
frequency of CYP2D6 alleles in Japanese.20 Plasma carbamazepine
concentration was also measured using a particleenhanced
turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (Dimension;
Dade Behring, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed by the Wilcoxon
signed rank test used for the comparison of the plasma drug
concentrations and the scores of clinical assessments. The
Spearman rank test was applied to analyze the correlation
between changes in aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole
concentrations before and after carbamazepine coadministration
and both the CYP2D6 genotype and the plasma
concentration of carbamazepine. A P value of 0.05 or less
was regarded as statistically significant. SPSS 11.0 for
Windows (SPSS, Japan Inc, Tokyo, Japan) was used for these
statistical analyses.",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
17015053,SLCO1B1 polymorphism and sex affect the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin but not fluvastatin.,"Pravastatin is a hydrophilic substrate and fluvastatin a lipophilic substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 encoded by SLCO1B1. Our aim was to compare the effects of SLCO1B1 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin and fluvastatin. We recruited 4 healthy volunteers (3 men and 1 woman) with the homozygous SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype, 12 (7 men and 5 women) with the heterozygous c.521TC genotype, and 16 (8 men and 8 women) with the homozygous c.521TT genotype (control subjects). In a crossover study each subject ingested a single 40-mg dose of fluvastatin and pravastatin with a washout period of at least 1 week. Plasma fluvastatin and pravastatin concentrations were measured for 12 hours. In men with the c.521CC genotype, the mean peak concentration in plasma and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity of pravastatin were 274% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92%-456%; P = .001) and 232% (95% CI, 74%-391%; P = .002) greater than those in men with the c.521TT genotype and 120% (95% CI, 11%-230%; P = .026) and 102% (95% CI, 3%-200%; P = .040) greater than those in men with the c.521TC genotype. In addition, women with the c.521TT genotype had a 147% (95% CI, 12%-281%; P = .028) greater peak concentration in plasma and a 142% (95% CI, 7%-242%; P = .034) greater area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity than men with the c.521TT genotype. The pharmacokinetic variables of pravastatin were approximately similar among women with different SLCO1B1 genotypes. No significant differences were seen in the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin between subjects with different SLCO1B1 genotypes or between the sexes. SLCO1B1 polymorphism has a large effect on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin but not fluvastatin. This suggests that the lipophilic fluvastatin can penetrate the hepatocyte plasma membrane via passive diffusion or that uptake transporters other than organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 mainly mediate its hepatic uptake. Moreover, the results suggest that sex may affect the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin and possibly the functional consequences of SLCO1B1 polymorphism.","METHODS
Subjects. A total of 32 healthy white volunteers participated
in the study after giving written informed
consent. They had been genotyped for SLCO1B1 sequence
variations as described previously.24 In addition,
they were genotyped for the ABCC2 c.1446C G
SNP by TaqMan allelic discrimination with an Applied
Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). The primers
used for ABCC2 c.1446C G genotyping were 5 -
GTGATGGTGCTTGTAATCCCAATT-3  and 5 -
CTGGGTGACTTTTTCTTTACCTGAATG-3 , and
the TaqMan MGB probes were 5 -VIC-ATACTGTCC
ACCAAGAGT-3  and 5 -6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)
-CTGTCCACGAAGAGT-3 . The reaction setup and
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycling conditions
were as described previously.24 The subjects were
genotyped for the CYP2C9*3 (c.1075A C) allele with
TaqMan Pre-Developed Assay Reagents for Allelic
Discrimination (Applied Biosystems) by use of the
7300 Real-Time PCR System according to the manufacturerÍs
instructions. Only subjects with the ABCC2
c.1446CC and CYP2C9 c.1075AA reference genotype
were recruited. The subjects were selected on the basis
of the SLCO1B1 g. 11187G A, g. 10499A C,
c.388A G, and c.521T C variants and were allocated
into one of 3 groups according to genotype. The control
group included 16 subjects (8 men and 8 women) with
the homozygous reference genotype at each position
(c.521TT group). Their mean age ( SD) was 23   2
years, with a mean height of 174   9 cm, mean weight
of 68   10 kg, and mean body mass index (BMI) of
22.6   2.5 kg/m2. The second group consisted of 12
subjects (7 men and 5 women) heterozygous for
c.521T C SNP (c.521TC group), including 4 who
were heterozygous for the SLCO1B1*15 haplotype
(g. 11187G, g. 10499A, c.388G, c.521C), 4 who
were heterozygous for the *16 haplotype (GCGC), and
4 who were heterozygous for the *17 haplotype
(AAGC). The haplotypes and diplotypes were statistically
inferred with the PHASE program, version
2.1.1.24-26a Of the subjects with the c.521TC genotype,
7 had the c.388AG genotype and 5 had the c.388GG
genotype. The mean age of the subjects with the
c.521TC genotype was 24   4 years, with a mean
height of 174   9 cm, mean weight of 69   8 kg, and
mean BMI of 22.9   2.2 kg/m2. The third group
comprised 4 subjects (3 men and 1 woman) with the
homozygous c.521CC genotype (c.521CC group).
Their mean age was 23   2 years, with a mean height
of 180   8 cm, mean weight of 84   8 kg, and mean
BMI of 25.9   0.7 kg/m2. The subjects were ascertained
to be healthy by medical history, physical examination,
and routine laboratory tests before they were
entered into the study. One subject (in the control
group) was a tobacco smoker, and none used any continuous
medication.
Study design. The study protocol was approved by the
Coordinating Ethics Committee of the Helsinki and Uusimaa
Hospital District and the National Agency for Medicines
(Helsinki, Finland). In phase 1, after an overnight
fast, the subjects ingested a single 40-mg dose of fluvastatin
(one 40-mg capsule of Canef; AstraZeneca,
S_dert_lje, Sweden) with 150 mL of water at 8 AM. In
phase 2, after a washout period of at least 1 week and after
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
2006;80(4):356-66 SLCO1B1 polymorphism, fluvastatin, and pravastatin 357
an overnight fast, the subjects ingested a single 40-mg
dose of pravastatin (one 40-mg tablet of Pravachol;
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Epernon, France) with 150 mL of
water at 8 AM. In both phases timed blood samples were
drawn before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 12
hours after the administration of a statin. The blood samples
(5 to 10 mL each) were taken into tubes that contained
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and placed on ice
immediately after sampling. Plasma was separated within
30 minutes and stored at  70ÁC until analysis. The use of
other drugs was prohibited for 1 week and the use of
grapefruit products was prohibited for 3 days before administration
of fluvastatin or pravastatin.
Determination of plasma drug concentrations.
Plasma fluvastatin concentrations were quantified by
use of an Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX Q-Trap
liquid chromatography_tandem mass spectrometry system
(Sciex Division of MDS, Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
Chromatographic separation was achieved on a
Symmetry C8 column (internal diameter, 50   2.1 mm;
particle size, 3.5 mm) (Waters, Milford, Mass) protected
by a Symmetry C8 guard column (internal diameter,
10   2.1 mm; particle size, 3.5 mm) (Waters).
The mobile phase consisted of 10-mmol/L ammonium
acetate (pH 4.95) and methanol. The mobile phase
gradient comprised 1 minute at 65% ammonium acetate,
3 minutes to 0% ammonium acetate, 4 minutes at
0% ammonium acetate, and 9 minutes at 65% ammonium
acetate, giving a total chromatographic run time
of 17 minutes. An aliquot of 4  L was injected at a
mobile phase flow rate of 220  L/min. The mass spectrometer
was operated in positive IonSpray mode
(Sciex Division of MDS), and the samples were analyzed
via multiple reaction monitoring by use of precursor
ion to product ion for fluvastatin and internal
standard (lovastatin acid). The ion transitions were
mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 412.2 to m/z 224 for fluvastatin
and m/z 405 to m/z 128 for lovastatin acid. The
limit of quantification of plasma fluvastatin was 0.5
ng/mL, and the between-day coefficients of variation
were 8.7% at 2.5 ng/mL, 6.7% at 25 ng/mL, and 12.9%
at 100 ng/mL (n   5).
Plasma pravastatin concentrations were quantified by
use of the PE SCIEX API 3000 liquid chromatography_
tandem mass spectrometry system (Sciex Division of
MDS) as described previously.27 The ion transition
monitored was m/z 442 to m/z 269, and the limit of
quantification of plasma pravastatin was 0.1 ng/mL.
The between-day coefficient of variation was 3.7% at
0.25 ng/mL, 8.4% at 1.0 ng/mL, 5.2% at 10 ng/mL, and
4.0% at 100 ng/mL (n   5).
Pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin
and pravastatin was characterized by the peak
concentration in plasma (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax),
elimination half-life (t_), and AUC from time 0 to
infinity [AUC(0- )]. The terminal log-linear part of
each concentration-time curve was identified visually,
and the elimination rate constant (ke) was determined
from natural log_transformed data with linear
regression analysis. The t_ was calculated by use
of the following equation: t_   ln2/ke. AUC(0- )
was calculated by a combination of the linear and
log-linear trapezoidal rules, with extrapolation to
infinity by division of the last measured concentration
by ke.
Statistical analysis. The results are expressed as
mean   SD in the text and tables and, for clarity, as
mean   SEM in the figures. Statistical comparisons of
the pharmacokinetic variables of fluvastatin and pravastatin
between subjects with the SLCO1B1 c.521TT,
c.521TC, and c.521CC genotypes and the sexes were
done by use of ANOVA and pairwise testing with the
Tukey test. Equality of group variances was tested with
the Levene statistic. Compatibility of the residuals with
normal distribution was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk
test. In case of unequal variances or unsatisfactory
distribution of the residuals, the data were logarithmically
transformed before analysis or tested with the
Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise testing with the Mann-
Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction, as appropriate.
The tmax data were analyzed by the Kruskal-
Wallis test with pairwise testing with the Mann-
Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction. The
possible contribution of subject characteristics (sex,
weight, and BMI) to variability in the AUC(0- ) of
pravastatin and fluvastatin was investigated by use of a
forward stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. A
P value threshold of .05 was used for entering and
removing independent variables from the model. The
data were analyzed with the statistical program SPSS
11.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, Ill). On the basis of
previous data on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin
and fluvastatin,6 the number of subjects in each genotype
group was estimated to be sufficient to detect a
50% greater AUC(0- ) of fluvastatin and pravastatin in
subjects with the c.521TC genotype than in those with
the c.521TT genotype, as well as a 100% greater
AUC(0- ) of fluvastatin and pravastatin in subjects
with the c.521CC genotype than in those with the
c.521TT genotype, with a power of at least 80% ( 
level of .05). Differences were considered statistically
significant at P 
 .05.",Genotyped PK Trial
17121171,Serum monitoring of antipsychotic drug levels during concomitant administration of sertraline and antipsychotic medication.,"To assess whether pharmacokinetic drug interactions occur when sertraline is added to antipsychotic medications. Forty-eight patients with remitted DSM-IV schizophrenia and comorbid major depression were randomized to placebo for 6 weeks or sertraline 50 mg for 4 weeks followed by sertraline 50 mg to 100 mg for 2 weeks for nonresponders. Treatment with the patients' usual antipsychotic continued. Weekly clinical outcome assessments occurred for 6 weeks, and serum samples for drug monitoring were collected at Weeks 1, 5, and 6. Serum concentrations of sertraline and antipsychotics were measured with standard assays. In both placebo- and sertraline-treated groups, most patients displayed minor fluctuations in antipsychotic serum levels over 6 weeks. There was no clinical evidence of drug interactions in the sertraline-treated group. Clinically significant adverse effects did not occur despite variable antipsychotic serum levels with or without sertraline. Concern about pharmacokinetic interactions should not deter the use of sertraline for depression in individuals with schizophrenia.","Methods
The study was approved by a research ethics committee, and
the details of the study design have been published elsewhere
(3). Participants were aged 18 to 65 years, with
DSM-IV major depression comorbid with schizophrenia (or
schizoaffective disorder) in partial or full remission. In this
double-blind trial, 48 participants (n = 44 with schizophrenia
and n = 4 with schizoaffective disorder) were randomized following
written informed consent to placebo for 6 weeks or
sertraline 50 mg for 4 weeks, followed by sertraline 50 to
100 mg for 2 weeks if they showed no evidence of response.
Participants were on a stable antipsychotic regimen.
Clinical outcomes were assessed weekly for 6 weeks with the
CDSS (4), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (5), the
Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (6), and the
HDRS (7). Serum samples were collected at Weeks 1, 5, and 6
for drug monitoring. The time and date of last dose taken and
of blood sampling were recorded. Serum drug concentrations
were measured with standard assays for both sertraline and
antipsychotics.
A 20% change in antipsychotic serum levels was defined as
meaningful on the basis of therapeutic drug monitoring studies
with risperidone (8) and olanzapine (9). FisherÍs exact
tests were performed with Stata, Version 8.0 (Stata Corporation,
College Station, TX; 2003) to compare fluctuations in
antipsychotic levels between groups.",DDI Randomized clinical trials
18754003,Effects of vitamin D supplementation in atorvastatin-treated patients: a new drug interaction with an unexpected consequence.,"The objective of this study was to determine vitamin D supplementation effects on concentrations of atorvastatin and cholesterol in patients. Sixteen patients (8 men, 8 women; 10 Caucasians, 4 African Americans, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian), aged 63 +/- 11 years (mean +/- SD, weight 92 +/- 31 kg) on atorvastatin (45 +/- 33 mg/day) were studied with and without supplemental vitamin D (800 IU/day for 6 weeks). Levels of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxy(OH) and 25 OH-metabolites), atorvastatin (parent, OH-acid metabolites, lactone, and lactone metabolites), and cholesterol (total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol) were determined at 0.5, 3, and 10 h after dosing. Vitamin D supplementation increased vitamin D-25-OH metabolites (P < 0.0001) without increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. Atorvastatin and active metabolite concentrations (P < 0.001) as well as LDL-cholesterol and total-cholesterol levels (97 +/- 28 mg/dl vs. 83 +/- 30 and 169 +/- 35 mg/dl vs. 157 +/- 37, P < 0.005) were lower during vitamin D supplementation. The conclusion of the study is that vitamin D supplementation lowers atorvastatin and active metabolite concentrations yet has synergistic effects on cholesterol concentrations.","Aging is often considered to result in decreases in drug clearance.
Most but not all studies of healthy humans report agerelated
decreases in clearance by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A.1_8
In contrast, our studies of nifedipine, verapamil, and amlodipine
in patient groups have not found age-related decreases in
apparent oral drug clearance of these oxidatively metabolized
medications.9_
11 We also found erythromycin breath test clearance
rates in elderly and frail patients to be within a range often
considered to reflect an ñinducedî state for drug metabolism.12
Use of clinically recognized CYP inducers13 was infrequent in
our older populations, but use of multivitamin preparations and
calcium plus vitamin D supplements was strikingly higher as age
increased, in nursing home residents compared with community-
dwelling participants and in women compared with men.
Formation of a 1,25-OH vitamin D_vitamin D receptor complex
has been shown to activate CYP3A in the intestine and in colon
and hepatic cell lines.14_16
Atorvastatin is a frequently prescribed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-
CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor that has low oral
bioavailability chiefly due to extensive first-pass metabolism by
CYP3A, both in the intestine and in the liver.17 Atorvastatin is
administered as atorvastatin acid, which is extensively metabolized
via lactonization and CYP3A4-mediated oxidations to
form two major active metabolites: 2-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid
and 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid. These hydroxylated metabolites
are excreted into bile in unchanged form or as glucuronide
conjugates.18 In vitro data have shown that active 1,25-hydroxy
vitamin D contributes to the regulation of CYP3A activity by
forming a complex with the vitamin D receptor that leads to
increased transcription of CYP3A protein and greater metabolism
of the CYP3A substrate midazolam.14,15 We thus hypothesized
that supplemental vitamin D might increase CYP3A
substrate clearance rates in patients.
This study was designed to test the hypothesis that supplemental
vitamin D intake lowers plasma concentrations of the
CYP3A substrate atorvastatin in stable patients, with the clinical
consequence of higher cholesterol concentrations.",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
19593168,ABCB1 and cytochrome P450 polymorphisms: clinical pharmacogenetics of clozapine.,"To examine the genetic factors influencing clozapine kinetics in vivo, 75 patients treated with clozapine were genotyped for CYPs and ABCB1 polymorphisms and phenotyped for CYP1A2 and CYP3A activity. CYP1A2 activity and dose-corrected trough steady-state plasma concentrations of clozapine correlated significantly (r = -0.61; P = 1 x 10), with no influence of the CYP1A2*1F genotype (P = 0.38). CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (*2/*2 genotype) had 2.3-fold higher (P = 0.036) clozapine concentrations than the extensive metabolizers (non-*2/*2). In patients comedicated with fluvoxamine, a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, clozapine and norclozapine concentrations correlate with CYP3A activity (r = 0.44, P = 0.075; r = 0.63, P = 0.007, respectively). Carriers of the ABCB1 3435TT genotype had a 1.6-fold higher clozapine plasma concentrations than noncarriers (P = 0.046). In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time a significant in vivo role of CYP2C19 and the P-gp transporter in the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. CYP1A2 is the main CYP isoform involved in clozapine metabolism, with CYP2C19 contributing moderately, and CYP3A4 contributing only in patients with reduced CYP1A2 activity. In addition, ABCB1, but not CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, nor CYP3A7 polymorphisms, influence clozapine pharmacokinetics.","MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Seventy-five inpatients from 2 psychiatric clinics, aged
18 years or older, on stable clozapine treatment and unchanged
comedication for at least 2 weeks (4 weeks for fluoxetine)
were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were any serious
uncontrolled illness, any organic psychiatric illness, or substance
dependence. To ensure compliance, patients took their
medication under supervision of a nurse for 4 days before
blood sampling. The study was approved by the local ethics
committees of the 2 participating centers (KoÂnigsfelden and

Blood Sampling
On the morning of day 1, before first drug intake, 75 Kg oral
midazolam was given to the patients for CYP3A phenotyping.16
A blood sample was taken 30 minutes later for determination of
1_OH-midazolam/midazolam plasma ratio16 and trough clozapine
and norclozapine plasma concentrations. They then received
their usual medication, together with 200 mg caffeine for
CYP1A2 phenotyping.19 A second blood sampling was performed
6 hours later for determination of the paraxanthinecaffeine
plasma ratio.19 No caffeine-containing food or beverage
was allowed on the test day until after the second blood sampling.
Plasma, after centrifugation, and K-EDTA whole blood
samples were kept frozen at j20-C until analysis. Measurement
of clozapine and norclozapine plasma concentrationswas repeated
on day 7 to control compliance and exclude within-subject variability.
Because there were no significant differences between
them (data not shown), results are expressed as the mean of the
2 blood samplings.
Assays of Drugs
Clozapine and norclozapine concentrations were determined
by gas chromatography with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector.20
Fluvoxamine,21 midazolam, and 1_OH-midazolam16,22 caffeine
and paraxanthine20 were measured by gas chromatographyYmass
spectrometry. Measured clozapine and norclozapine plasma concentrations
were corrected by clozapine daily dose and hereafter
are referred to as plasma concentrations.
Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA blood samples
with the FlexiGene DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland).
All the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with the
exception of CYP2D6*5 and CYP2D6*xN, were detected by
real-time PCR with 5_-nuclease allelic discrimination assays
(ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System; Applied Biosystems,
Rotkreuz, Switzerland) with primers and probes obtained
from Applied Biosystems. The CYP1A2*1F, CYP2B6*4,
CYP2B6*5, CYP2B6*6, CYP2B6*7, CYP2B6*9, CYP2C9*2,
CYP2C9*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2D6*3,
CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*6, CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3, ABCB1
61A9G, 2677G9T, and 3435C9T SNPs were analyzed as previously
described.20,23 CYP2D6 gene deletion (allele *5) and
duplication/multiduplication (allele *xN) were analyzed by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and long PCR,
respectively.23
CYP3A7*1C (j262T9A and j270T9G) allele was determined
as previously described.24 CYP2C19*17 (j806C9T)
allele was determined using the following primers, GTTTG
GAAGTTGTTTTGTTTTGCTAA (forward), CATCGTGGCG
CATTATCTCTT (reverse), and labeled probes, 6-FAMTTCTCAAAGcATCTCT-
MGBNFQ, and VICYTTCTGTTCT
CAAAGtATCT-MGBNFQ. The 25 KL PCR mixture contained
12.5 KL TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems),
900 nM of each primer, 200 nM of each TaqMan
minor groove binder nonfluorescent quencher probe, and 40 ng
(100 ng for CYP2C19*17) of genomic DNA. After an activation
step comprising AmpErase (50-C for 2 minutes) and AmpliTaq
Gold enzyme activation (95-C for 10 minutes), 60 PCR
cycles (50 cycles for CYP2C19*17) were performed with
15 seconds at 92-C and 1 minute at 58-C (1.5 minutes at
60-C for CYP2C19*17). CYP3A4 rs4646437C9T was analyzed
with commercial TaqMan Drug Metabolism Genotyping
Assays according to the manufacturerÍs instructions (Assay Ids
C_32306227_10; Applied Biosystems).
Clinical Assessments
Routine clinical chemistry and hematologic parameters
were measured at baseline. All patients underwent a physical
examination at screening; their medical history was recorded,
and psychiatric and somatic diagnoses were confirmed. On
days 1 and 7, vital signs, weight, spontaneously reported adverse
events, and lifestyle factors (smoking, caffeine, and grapefruit
intake) were noted. Weight gain data were collected retrospectively
from the patientÍs medical files.
Statistical Analysis
Clozapine and norclozapine blood concentrations were compared
between different genotypes by nonparametric analyses
(Kruskal-Wallis test for 92, Mann-Whitney U test for 2 groups).
Correlations between plasma concentrations and CYP1A2 or
CYP3A activity were assessed by Spearman test, and multivariate
analyses were performed using linear regression (backward
method). A P G 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance. All statistical tests were performed in the whole
group of patients and in the 2 subgroups with and without
fluvoxamine as inhibition by fluvoxamine could mask the
potential influence of other factors. Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). For
ABCB1 polymorphisms, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested,
and linkage disequilibrium (LewontinÍs DÍcoefficient) was
estimated with STATA (version 10; Stata Corporation, College
Station, Tex). Haplotypes were inferred using the haplo.em function
in R (http://www.r-project.org/), which uses expectationmaximization
algorithm. As none of the inferred haplotypes had a
posterior probability below 98%, haplotype uncertainty can be
considered as minimal. Genetic association studies were conducted
using the haplo.score function in R (which uses generalized
linear models and takes haplotype uncertainty into account)
with an additive effect and a Gaussian distribution for the trait.",Genotyped PK Trial
12172343,Inhibition of risperidone metabolism by fluoxetine in patients with schizophrenia: a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interaction.,"The effect of fluoxetine on the steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH-risperidone) was evaluated in 10 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients stabilized on risperidone (4-6 mg/day) received additional fluoxetine (20 mg/day) to treat concomitant depression. One patient dropped out after 1 week due to the occurrence of akathisia associated with markedly increased plasma risperidone concentrations. In the other subjects, mean plasma concentrations of risperidone increased during fluoxetine administration from 12 +/- 9 ng/mL at baseline to 56 +/- 31 at week 4 (p < 0.001), while the levels of 9-OH-risperidone were not significantly affected. After 4 weeks of combined treatment, the levels of the active moiety (sum of the concentrations of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone) increased by 75% (range, 9-204%, p < 0.01) compared with baseline. The mean plasma risperidone/9-OH-risperidone ratio also increased significantly. During the second week of adjunctive therapy, two patients developed Parkinsonian symptoms, which were controlled with anticholinergic medication. These findings indicate that fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 and a less potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, reduces the clearance of risperidone by inhibiting its 9-hydroxylation or alternative metabolic pathways. This interaction may lead to toxic plasma risperidone concentrations. In addition to careful clinical observation, monitoring plasma risperidone levels may be of value in patients given adjunctive therapy with fluoxetine.","Patients and Methods
Ten outpatients (seven men and three women, age
27_55 years) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n  7) or
schizoaffective disorder, depressive type (n   3) according
to the criteria of the DSM-IV and followed up at
the Centers of Mental Health participated in the study.
The protocol was approved by a local ethics committee,
and written informed consent was obtained from the patients
or their relatives. All patients were stabilized on
risperidone at a constant dosage (4_6 mg/day given as
two divided daily administrations) for at least 4 weeks
and received adjunctive fluoxetine treatment (20 mg/day
in the morning) for the management of concomitant depression.
The dosage of risperidone was maintained
constant throughout the duration of the study, and use
of other drugs known to act as inhibitors or inducers of
risperidone metabolism was not allowed.15 The study
was designed as an open pharmacokinetic investigation
with an observation period limited to the first 4 weeks of
combination therapy.
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were
drawn into heparinized tubes at 8:00 a.m. (12 to 13 hours
after the last dose of risperidone, immediately before the
morning fluoxetine and risperidone doses) in the week
before starting fluoxetine (baseline) and after 2 and 4
weeks of combination therapy. The plasma was separated
immediately and stored at  20 C until assayed.
Risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone concentrations were
measured by HPLC according to a validated method developed
in our laboratory, with a limit of quantitation of
2 nmol/L for both analytes.16 As a measure of compliance,
the plasma concentrations of the S- and R-enantiomers of
fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine were estimated
at week 4 by an enantioselective HPLC method.17
Patients were also genotyped for CYP2D6 by allelespecific
polymerase chain reaction.18
Tolerability was assessed by interview and a medical
examination at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks, and extrapyramidal
side effects were specifically investigated
at the same times by using the Simpson and Angus
Scale (SAS).19 Psychopathological state was assessed
by using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
(PANSS)20 for psychotic symptoms and the Hamilton
Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)21 for depressive
symptomatology.
Differences in plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-
OH-risperidone, and their sum (active moiety) after 2 and
4 weeks compared with baseline were evaluated statistically
by using the Student t-test with Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons. Changes in plasma risperidone/
9-OH risperidone ratio and in the SAS, PANSS, and
HAM-D scores before and during fluoxetine treatment
were compared by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results
are given in the text as mean   SD. A p value  0.05
was regarded as statistically significant",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
19865002,Effect of valproate on olanzapine plasma concentrations in patients with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder.,"The effect of valproate on the steady-state plasma concentrations of olanzapine was investigated in 18 patients with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder. Additional valproate, at a dose ranging from 600 to 2000 mg/d, was administered for 4 weeks to patients stabilized on olanzapine (5-20 mg/d). During valproate coadministration, mean plasma olanzapine concentrations decreased significantly from 32.9 +/- 9.7 ng/mL at baseline to 27.4 +/- 9.8 ng/mL at week 2 (P = 0.02), and to 26.9 +/- 9.2 ng/mL at week 4 (P = 0.001). Smoking also decreased plasma olanzapine concentrations. Valproate coadministration with olanzapine was well tolerated and no patient showed a worsening of his or her psychopathological condition. These findings indicate that valproate, at doses of up to 2000 mg/d, is associated with a minimal, presumably not clinically significant, decrease in plasma olanzapine concentrations, possibly as a result of induction of olanzapine metabolism. New studies are needed to confirm that valproate could have mild inductive effects.","PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Twenty-one outpatients (12 men and 9 women, aged 23_
54 years) participated in the study. They had a diagnosis of
bipolar (n = 14) or schizoaffective (n = 7) disorder according to
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
IV, and were stabilized on olanzapine but required treatment
with a mood stabilizer. The protocol was approved by a local
Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained
from the patients or their relatives.
Study Design
Before receiving adjunctive valproate as a mood
stabilizer, all patients received an olanzapine constant dose
(5_20 mg/d) for 1 month; this dose was kept constant
throughout the study. In addition to plasma concentration
monitoring, compliance with olanzapine treatment was also
checked by pill count. Initial valproate doses were decided by
the treating physician. Doses were subsequently individualized
according to clinical response, usually within 7_10 days, and
then maintained stable. Use of other drugs known to act as
inhibitors or inducers of olanzapine metabolism was not
allowed.3 Concomitant treatment with other medications,
when present, remained unchanged.
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were
drawn into heparinized tubes at 8:00 AM (12_13 hours after the
olanzapine dose) the week before starting valproate treatment
(baseline), and after 2 and 4 weeks of valproate coadministration.
Plasma was separated immediately and stored at
220 C until assayed.
Tolerability was evaluated by interview and medical
examination at baseline, and after 2 and 4 weeks of combined
therapy. Because this was an open, uncontrolled, design using
a small heterogeneous sample, the clinical efficacy of the
combination was not assessed.
Drug Assays
The steady-state plasma olanzapine concentrations were
measured by high-performance liquid chromatography according
to the method of DÍArrigo et al14; the assay quantification
limit was 5 ng/mL. To ensure treatment compliance,
plasma valproate concentrations were determined by enzymemultiplied
immunoassay; the limit of quantification was 1 mg/mL.
Statistics
Olanzapine plasma concentrations at baseline and
during valproate comedication were compared by pairedsamples
t tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons. Means 6 SD of variables are reported. A P
value ,0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
In an analysis of the repeated measures provided by the
patients, the effect of valproate concentrations on the possible
changes in olanzapine concentrations was investigated by
fitting a random intercept linear model.15 In this model, the
dependent variable was the difference between the patientÍs
olanzapine concentration measured at a particular time (after 2
or 4 weeks) and his or her baseline olanzapine concentration.
The independent variables were the patientÍs age, current
smoking status, valproate concentrations, and undergoing
4 weeks of valproate treatment (compared with 2 weeks). To
investigate a possible difference in valproate effects between
the fourth and second week of valproate treatment, a week_
valproate concentration interaction term was also included in
the model. Analyses of residuals and intercept predictors
suggested that the model fit well. Statistical analyses were
performed with the Stata software.16",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
