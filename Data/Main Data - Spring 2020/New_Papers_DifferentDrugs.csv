0,23738582,drug substantially increases steady-state drug exposure in healthy volunteers.,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the drug P450 (CYP) 3A4 and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 inhibitor drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug. We also aimed to evaluate the impact of CYP2C9 and SLCO1B1 (encoding for OATP1B1) genotypes and their drug. We assessed the effect of the OATP and CYP3A inhibitor drug on drug pharmacokinetics at steady state and concurrently quantified changes of CYP3A activity using drug as a probe drug. Sixteen healthy volunteers received therapeutic doses of drug (125_mg twice daily) for 14 days and drug (500_mg twice daily) concomitantly for the last 4 days, and drug pharmacokinetics was assessed on days 1, 10 and 14. drug significantly increased drug area under the drug concentration-time curve of the dosing interval 3.7-fold and peak concentration 3.8-fold in all participants irrespective of the genotype. drug also reduced CYP3A activity (drug clearance) in all participants; however, these changes were not correlated to the changes of drug clearance. drug substantially increases the exposure to drug, suggesting that dose reductions may be necessary.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC3895355,Methods Study quality standards After approval

1,12269976,"Effects of drug, drug and drug on intragastric pH in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers.","To investigate the inhibitory effects on gastric drug secretion of three drug pump inhibitors, drug, drug and drug, using a three-way crossover design in healthy Helicobacter pylori-negative,S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C19) homo- and hetero-extensive metabolizers. Eight healthy Japanese male volunteers were enrolled. After the administration of drug (10 drug/day), drug (30 drug/day) or drug (20 drug/day), intragastric pH monitoring was commenced from 24 h before the first drug pump inhibitor dose, and continued for days 1-3 after drug pump inhibitor administration. The pH electrode was used for 48 h and changed just before pH monitoring on day 2. For the administration of 10 drug/day drug, the mean ratios of the 24-h pH > or = 3 holding time were 5.7 +/- 1.1%,13.6 +/- 2.2%, 35.3 +/- 2.7% and 62.8 +/- 3.1% for the pre-treatment day and days 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The same ratios for drug (30 drug/day) were 5.7 +/- 0.7%, 7.4 +/- 1.5%, 13.6 +/- 3.4% and 26.6 +/- 4.9%; the same ratios for 20 drug/day drug were 5.9 +/- 0.9%, 6.1 +/- 1.2%, 11.4 +/- 2.8% and 16.4 +/- 4.6%. The mean ratio of the 24-h pH > or = 3 holding time of days 1-3 increased significantly compared to the pre-treatment day (P < 0.01) with the administration of drug and drug. The magnitude of inhibition of gastric drug secretion after drug administration was stronger than that after drug. A significant elevation of the mean ratio of the 24-h pH > or = 3 holding time was demonstrated on days 2 and 3 with drug (P < 0.01). In H. pylori-negative CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers, drug (10 drug/day) shows a faster onset of rising intragastric pH and a stronger inhibition of gastric drug secretion than do drug (30 drug/day) or drug (20 drug/day).","Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,Subjects methods Subjects The subjects eight healthy male volunteers aged 48_years weighing 52 78_kg All volunteers gave written informed consent study conducted accordance Declaration Helsinki The subjects negative anti_H pylori immunoglobulin G antibodies SRL Inc Tokyo Japan confirmed 13C_urea breath test Ubit_IR200 Ohtsuka Electronics Tokyo Japan CYP2C19 genotyping DNA samples obtained eight individuals The samples analysed polymerase chain reaction_restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR_RFLP method detect CYP2C19 genotype according previously reported technique 15 It reported two point mutations CYP2C19 gene The wild_type allele G position exon G position exon CYP2C19 One m1 allele mutated alleles A position exon Another mutated allele m2 allele A position exon 4 16 _17 Four individuals genotyped homozygous extensive metabolizers homo_extensive metabolizers two wild_type alleles Another four individuals genotyped heterozygous extensive metabolizers hetero_extensive metabolizers one wild_type allele one m1 allele SRL Inc Tokyo Japan Study protocol The first 24_h intragastric pH monitoring subjects represented pre_treatment period drug 10_mg Pariet Eisai Co Ltd Tokyo Japan drug 30_mg Takepron Takeda Co Ltd Osaka Japan drug 20_mg Omepral Fujisawa drug Co Ltd Osaka Japan administered following day 30_min evening meal drug administered days around time The order administration test agents subject randomized crossover manner The washout periods studies least 2_weeks subject completed study three test drug within 4_month period Subjects instructed take three meals day dinner 19 00_h breakfast 07 30_h lunch 12 30_h Meals standardized subjects asked keep contents meal similar possible 48_h pH_metry The pH electrode inserted transnasally local anaesthesia positioned fluoroscopically electrode located body stomach 5_cm distal cardia Monitoring performed continuously 48_h 17 00_h time pH electrode changed within 40_min monitoring continued 48_h The gastric pH measured 10_s intervals portable pH meter attached glass pH electrode Chemical Instrument Co Ltd Tokyo Japan The pH electrode calibrated recording using standard drug solutions pH_1 68 pH_7 00 At end recording data transferred personal computer stored analysed software Chemical Instrument Co Ltd Tokyo Japan The 24_h monitoring period divided daytime 07 00 23 00_h night_time 23 00 07 00_h periods Statistical analysis A 24_h profile intragastric pH obtained subject baseline days 1 3 dosing The mean percentage time intragastric pH_ _3 pH_ _3 holding time calculated subject dosing session suitable intervals daytime 07 00 23 00_h night_time 23 00 07 00_h All numerical data listed Table_1 given mean_ _s d range Differences pH_ _3 holding time day drug administration compared baseline data using paired t_test Bonferroni method correct multiplicity A P value less _0 05 3 considered statistically significant Statistical calculations performed using drug software system Table Intragastric pH_ _3 holding time  administration drug pump inhibitors 3_days

3,24246616,Effects of drug on the antiplatelet effects and pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy volunteers.,"Several studies have suggested that drug-pump inhibitors (PPIs), mostly drug, interact with drug efficacy by inhibiting the formation of its active metabolite via CYP2C19 inhibition. Whether this occurs with all PPIs is a matter of debate. As drug is a less potent CYP2C19 inhibitor than other PPIs, we studied the interaction between drug and the antiplatelet actions and pharmacokinetics of drug. To demonstrate the drug-inferiority of drug drug placebo using change in platelet reactivity index (PRI; drug-stimulated phosphoprotein [VASP] assay) in a predefined population of good drug responders. drug was used as the positive control. In this randomized three-period crossover study in healthy volunteers, 36 healthy men received drug (75 drug/day for 7 days) with placebo, drug (20mg/day) or drug (20mg/day). drug antiplatelet effects and disposition kinetics were assessed on day 7 of drug therapy. drug-inferiority threshold was predefined as an upper limit of the 90% confidence interval for the difference in change in PRI between placebo and drug of<10% in good drug responders. In good drug responders (inhibition of VASP index>30%), the drug antiplatelet effect remained drug-inferior to placebo during drug (difference 3.4% [-1.7; 8.5]) but not drug (difference 7.5% [2.5; 12.6]) co-administration. The AUC0-24 and Cmax of active drug metabolite decreased with both drug and drug, and conditions of bioequivalence were not met, except for AUC0-24 with drug. drug does not interact with drug to the same extent as drug. However, under our experimental conditions and drug-pump inhibitor doses, there was drug significant pharmacodynamic interaction between drug or drug and drug, despite a significant decrease in the formation of drug active metabolite.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,Methods Study design This prospective placeboand active controlled open

4,26597253,"The Effect of drug, a MATE1-drug Inhibitor, on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of drug.","Pharmacokinetic outcomes of transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions (TMDDIs) are increasingly being evaluated clinically. The goal of our study was to determine the effects of drug inhibition of multidrug and drug extrusion protein 1 (MATE1), using drug, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in healthy volunteers. Volunteers received drug alone or with drug in a crossover design. As a positive control, the longitudinal effects of drug on the drug levels of drug (an endogenous substrate of MATE1) were quantified in parallel. drug unbound concentrations in drug reached 1 M, thus exceeding the in vitro concentrations that inhibit MATE1 [concentration of drug producing 50 % inhibition (IC50) 0.25 M]. Based on current regulatory guidance, these concentrations are expected to inhibit MATE1 clinically [i.e. drug unbound drug drug concentration (C max,u)/IC50 >0.1]. Consistent with MATE1 inhibition, drug administration significantly altered drug drug and urine levels in opposing directions (p < 0.005). Interestingly, drug increased the estimated bioavailability of drug [cumulative amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine from time zero to infinity (A e )/dose; p < 0.005] without affecting its systemic exposure [area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) or drug concentration in drug (C max)] as a result of a counteracting increase in drug renal clearance. Moreover, drug-drug co-therapy caused a transient effect on drug drug tolerance tests [area under the drug drug concentration-time curve between time zero and 0.5 h (AUCglu,0.5); p < 0.005]. These results suggest that drug may improve the bioavailability and enhance the renal clearance of drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't ;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",None,Methods Clinical Study Procedures Healthy volunteers recruited described Supplemental Material In open label two phase crossover study equal number volunteers completed drug alone followed drug plus drug treatment sequence n 6 completed treatments reverse order i e drug plus drug followed drug alone n 6 See Clinical Study Design Fig The interval treatment phases set minimum 7days allow complete elimination study drug Study day procedures described drug Alone Phase Volunteers reported Clinical Research Center CRC San Francisco General Hospital SFGH three day drug controlled diet 200 250 g day overnight fast 10h remained drug visit 48h Vital signs obtained inclusion exclusion criteria confirmed 3h drug drug tolerance test OGTT g performed morning Day Subjects administered drug immediate release tablet IRT drug evening Day followed drug IRT 12h later Day On Day fasting 10h second OGTT administered 2h second dose drug Fig 1b A drug meal schedule standardized drug controlled meal resumed study days completion OGTT For 12h following second dose drug volunteers asked drink oz drug every 2h maintain urine flow pH A series venous drug samples drawn 2h first drug dose 24h second drug dose pharmacokinetic analysis drug drug samples collected minutes drug administration pharmacodynamic analysis drug concentrations Each drug sample collected heparinized tubes kept ice centrifugation rpm min 4 C Urine samples collected following time intervals pre dose 0 12h first drug dose 0 2 2 4 4 6 6 8 8 12 12 24h second drug dose Urine volume pH recorded interval Aliquots drug urine specimens stored _80 C pending bioanalysis drug Plus drug Phase Procedures drug Plus drug Phase repeated described addition six drug doses drug drug total administered course 48h visit A single dose drug drug administered 1h prior OGTT Day Multiple dosing drug drug given hourly intervals beginning hours second dose drug morning Day See Study Design Fig 1b Eight additional drug draws drug taken 4h Day single dose pharmacokinetic analysis drug Analytical Methods drug drug concentrations drug urine concomitantly quantified using drug chromatography  drug mass spectrometry drug MS MS The assay included modifications previously reported method follows aliquot clinical sample drug urine mixed volumes drug containing internal standards i e drug d6 drug phenformin drug The mobile phase consisted drug double distilled drug mM drug formate mM drug drug v v The assay validated range calibration curve drug 5 2000 drug drug urine 40 4000 drug drug drug drug Both intra day inter day assay coefficients variation less analytes drug concentrations drug drug concentrations drug urine determined CLIA certified Clinical Laboratory SFGH For vitro methodology see Supplemental Material Clinical Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters drug 0 24h second dose drug total drug 0 4h 12h single drug dose evaluated using drug compartmental analysis previously described Phoenix WinNonlin Pharsight Certara Company St Louis MO USA Participants treatment periods missing inaccurate urine volumes excluded statistical analysis Since inhibition MATE1 known alter drug concentrations drug affect glomerular filtration CKD EPI drug equation used calculate drug clearance CLCR estimate glomerular filtration rate GFR drug renal secretion clearance CLRS calculated based estimated GFR using equation CLRS  CLR _ drug   GFR drug fraction unbound drug drug drug total renal clearance calculated using total amount drug excreted urine Ae36 divided total area curve AUC36 two doses The drug AUC36 determined population approach using population pharmacokinetic parameters model previously developed healthy volunteers similar study conditions together integration techniques NONMEM Bioavailability calculated total amount drug excreted urine estimated infinity divided total dose drug drug assuming drug eliminated entirely kidney fe 1 For description pharmacometric modeling simulation methodologies drug drug see Supplemental Material Statistical Analysis The size study population n 12 calculated allow detection true difference AUC3 drug power significance level Data presented mean  SEM unless otherwise specified Paired nonparametric Student s t tests used analyze differences drug pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic parameters drug alone versus drug plus drug well genotypes using GraphPad Prism GraphPad Software Inc San Diego CA USA Geometric mean ratios GMR confidence interval drug GMR calculated using Stata StataCorp LP College Station Texas USA estimate clinically relevant differences drug pharmacokinetic parameters standard bioequivalence boundaries 80 125

6,24036846,drug drug does not affect drug pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.,"Gastric upset is a common side effect of drug therapy, and drug drug is frequently used concomitantly, either as drug or as drug supplementation. With the increasing number of drug agents in cancer therapy, drug drug-drug interactions are becoming more relevant. drug has already been shown to be absorbed to a much lesser extent when co-administered with drug pump inhibitors. Because exposure to sub-therapeutic concentrations of anticancer drug such as drug may result in selection of resistant clones and ultimately relapse, we studied the effect of a drug drug supplement (drug Ultra 1000 ) on drug pharmacokinetics. drug drug may be co-administered with drug without significantly affecting the pharmacokinetics of drug and potentially impacting efficacy. drug is a second-generation drug drug kinase inhibitor with superior efficacy compared with drug mesylate in the treatment for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. drug drug is commonly used as a source of drug supplementation or as drug to ameliorate the gastrointestinal side effects associated with drug, which could have unknown effects on drug drug. The purpose of this study was to provide information on the effect of drug drug on the PK of drug in healthy volunteers. Healthy subjects were enrolled in a two-period, open-label, single-institution, randomized, cross-drug, fixed-schedule study. In one period, each subject received 400 drug of drug p.o. In the other period, 4,000 drug of drug drug (4 X drug Ultra 1000 ) was administered p.o. 15 min prior to the drug dose. drug samples were collected at specified timepoints, concentrations of drug were quantitated by drug-MS, and data were analyzed drug-compartmentally. Eleven subjects were evaluable. drug supplementation did not significantly affect drug pharmacokinetic parameters including area under the drug concentration versus time curve (18.4 _g/drug h alone vs. 16.9 _g/drug h with drug drug, p = 0.83; 80 % power); drug drug concentration (C(max)) (0.670 _g/drug alone vs. 6.18 _g/drug with drug drug, p = 0.97); or half-life (18.9 h alone vs. 17.2 h with drug drug, p = 0.18).

7,28867665,Pharmacogenomic Variability of drug Baclofen Clearance and Clinical Response in Children With Cerebral Palsy.,"Pharmacogenomic variability can contribute to differences in pharmacokinetics and clinical responses. Pediatric patients with cerebral palsy with genetic variations have not been studied for these potential differences. To determine the genetic sources of variation in drug baclofen clearance and clinical responses. Pharmacogenomic add-on study to determine variability in drug baclofen clearance and clinical responses. Multicenter study based in academic pediatric cerebral palsy clinics. A total of 49 patients with cerebral palsy who had participated in an drug baclofen pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study. Of 53 participants in a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic trial, 49 underwent genetic analysis of 307 key genes and 4535 single-nucleotide polymorphisms involved in drug drug, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Associations between genotypes and phenotypes of baclofen disposition (weight-corrected and allometrically scaled clearance) and clinical endpoints (improvement from baseline in mean hamstring Modified Tardieu Scale scores from baseline for improvement of R1 spastic catch) were determined by univariate analysis with correction for multiple testing by false discovery rate. Primary outcome measures were the genotypic and phenotypic variability of drug baclofen in allometrically scaled clearance and change in the Modified Tardieu Scale angle compared to baseline. After univariate analysis of the data, the SNP of ABCC9 (rs11046232, heterozygous AT versus the reference TT genotype) was associated with a 2-fold increase in drug baclofen clearance (mean 0.51   standard deviation 0.05 L/h/kg for the AT genotype versus 0.25   0.07 L/h/kg for the TT genotype, adjusted P < .001). Clinical responses were associated with decreased spasticity by Modified Tardieu Scale in allelic variants with SNPs ABCC12, SLC28A1, and PPARD. Genetic variation in ABCC9 affecting drug baclofen clearance highlights the need for continued studies of genetic polymorphisms to better characterize variable drug response in children with cerebral palsy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCC12, SLC28A1, and PPARD were associated with varied responses, which warrants further investigation to determine their effect on spasticity.

9,22464259,"A randomized, 2-period, crossover design study to assess the effects of drug, drug, drug, and drug on the steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in healthy volunteers.","The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different drug pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug. Metabolism of drug requires drug P450s (CYPs), including CYP2C19. However, PPIs may inhibit CYP2C19, potentially reducing the effectiveness of drug. A randomized, open-label, 2-period, crossover study of healthy subjects (n = 160, age 18 to 55 years, homozygous for CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer genotype, confined, standardized diet) was conducted. drug 75 drug with or without a drug (drug 60 drug, drug 30 drug, drug 40 drug, or, as a positive control to maximize potential interaction and demonstrate assay sensitivity, drug 80 drug) was given daily for 9 days. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed on days 9 and 10. Pharmacodynamic end-points were drug-stimulated phosphoprotein P2Y(12) platelet reactivity index, maximal platelet aggregation to 5 and 20 _mol/l adenosine diphosphate, and VerifyNow P2Y12 platelet response units. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses with drug demonstrated assay sensitivity. The area under the curve for drug active metabolite decreased significantly with drug but not with drug or drug. Similarly, drug but not drug or drug significantly reduced the effect of drug on drug-stimulated phosphoprotein platelet reactivity index. All PPIs decreased the peak drug concentration of drug active metabolite (drug > drug > drug > drug) and showed a corresponding order of potency for effects on maximal platelet aggregation and platelet response units. Generation of drug active metabolite and inhibition of platelet function were reduced less by the coadministration of drug or drug with drug than by the coadministration of drug or drug. These results suggest that the potential of PPIs to attenuate the efficacy of drug could be minimized by the use of drug or drug rather than drug or drug.","Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,Methods The study design enrollment criteria drug PK PD statistics described detail Online Appendix To eliminate variables known influence drug and or drug metabolism homozygous CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer genotype healthy subjects enrolled confined clinical research unit
10,29377228,Developmental pharmacogenetics of CYP2C19 in neonates and young infants: drug as a probe drug.,"Although substantial progress has been made in understanding of ontogeny of drug metabolism, there is still a gap of knowledge in developmental pharmacogenetics in neonates. We hypothesized that both age and pharmacogenetics might explain the developmental pattern of CYP2C19. We conducted a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenetic study to quantify the developmental pharmacogenetics of CYP2C19 in neonates and young infants using drug as a probe drug. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected from 51 Caucasian neonates and young infants, who were receiving drug treatment. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenetic analysis of drug and its metabolites was performed using NONMEM. Data fitted a one-compartment parent and metabolite model with first-order drug and elimination. CYP2C19 and drug are predominantly involved in the metabolism of drug despite their relatively low activities compared to adults. The clearance of drug converted to 5-hydroxy-drug (CL Developmental pharmacogenetics of CYP2C19 was quantitatively described in neonates and young infants using drug as a probe drug.

13,20233203,Effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy Korean subjects.,"drug is a drug 5 inhibitor used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It is metabolized to drug-8164, a major metabolite, by drug. This study was performed to investigate the effect of drug, a known drug inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of drug. An open-label, two-period, fixed-sequence crossover study was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers. They received a single 100-drug drug dose of drug. Following a 5-day interval, 400 drug of drug was administered once a day for three consecutive days. On day 3 of drug treatment, a second 100 drug of drug was dosed concomitantly. drug samples were collected at time points up to 48 h without drug treatment and up to 72 h with drug co-administration. The drug concentration of drug was determined using drug chromatography-drug mass spectrometry. Following drug co-administration, the mean C(max) and AUC(last) of drug (95% confidence interval) increased 1.9-fold (1.60, 2.27) and 3.2-fold (2.82, 3.63), respectively. The median time to reach the C(max) was delayed in the co-administrated treatment, while the mean terminal elimination half-life (t(1/2)) remained relatively unchanged regardless of drug co-administration. The metabolic AUC ratio (AUC(last) of drug-8164/AUC(last) of drug) was 1.71 when drug was administered alone, and the value decreased to 0.19 when drug was dosed in the presence of drug. Regarding safety assessments, drug clinically significant difference or serious adverse event was observed. The systemic exposure of drug increased significantly when it was administered with drug.

15,24722393,Geneva cocktail for drug p450 and P-glycoprotein activity assessment using dried drug spots.,"The suitability of the capillary dried drug spot (DBS) sampling method was assessed for simultaneous phenotyping of drug P450 (CYP) drug and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) using a cocktail approach. drug volunteers received an drug cocktail capsule containing low doses of the probes drug (CYP2B6), drug (CYP2C9), drug (CYP2C19), drug (CYP2D6), drug (CYP3A), and drug (P-gp) with coffee/Coke (CYP1A2) on four occasions. They received the cocktail alone (session 1), and with the CYP inhibitors fluvoxamine and drug (session 2) and drug (session 3). In session 4, subjects received the cocktail after a 7-day pretreatment with the inducer drug. The concentrations of probes/metabolites were determined in DBS and drug using a single drug chromatography-drug mass spectrometry method. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug were comparable in DBS and drug. Important modulation of CYP and P-gp activities was observed in the presence of inhibitors and the inducer. Minimally invasive one- and three-point (at 2, 3, and 6 h) DBS-sampling methods were found to reliably reflect CYP and P-gp activities at each session.","Evaluation Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC4151019,"Subjects. This study (registration NCT01731067) was approved by the ethics committee of Geneva University Hospitals (ID: 12085) and the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic).

After giving written informed consent, 10 healthy male volunteers were included in the study. Their median age was 23 years (range: 2036 years) and median body mass index was 22.0 (range: 19.924.4) (see Supplementary Table S1 online for details). One subject was from North Africa, one was of mixed Caucasian and African origin, and all the others were Caucasians. All of the subjects were nonsmokers and had normal results on physical examination, electrocardiogram, and liver function test and were not taking any medications. Poor CYP2D6 (*4/*4; *4/*5; *5/*5), CYP2C9 (*2/*2; *2/*3; *3/*3), or CYP2C19 (*2/*2) metabolizers were not included in the study. Subjects were not permitted to drink grapefruit juice for at least 1 week before and throughout the study period and were required to abstain from alcohol and caffeine-containing products at least 48_h before each study session.

Study design. This open-label study was performed in four sessions with at least 1-week washout period between each session. Cocktail capsules containing low-dose bupropion (25_mg), flurbiprofen (25_mg), dextromethorphan (10_mg), omeprazole (5_mg), midazolam (1_mg), and fexofenadine (25_mg) were produced by the pharmacy of Geneva University Hospitals under good manufacturing practice conditions. At each session, after an overnight fast, volunteers received an oral cocktail capsule together with a cup of coffee (caffeine: 100_mg) or Coke (caffeine: 25_mg). They were given their first meal 1_h after cocktail administration and a second meal 3_h later. All the volunteers received the treatments in the same order. At session 1, volunteers received only the cocktail capsule with coffee or Coke. At session 2, volunteers received one dose of fluvoxamine (50_mg) 12_h before cocktail administration, followed by a second dose of fluvoxamine (50_mg) together with voriconazole (400_mg) 2_h before cocktail administration (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A inhibition). At session 3, each subject was given 200_mg of quinidine (CYP2D6 and P-gp inhibitor) 2_h before cocktail administration. The CYP and P-gp inhibition was divided in two sessions due to the potential interaction (QT interval prolongation) between voriconazole and quinidine. Seven days before the fourth session, volunteers were given seven tablets of rifampicin (600_mg) and were asked to take one tablet every evening until the evening before the session (induction of CYP isoforms and P-gp). They were specifically asked about their compliance with the rifampicin regimen.

At each session, capillary and venous blood samples were collected simultaneously before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8_h after cocktail administration. Capillary whole blood (10 l) was collected on a Whatman 903 filter paper card (Westborough, MA) after a small finger prick (BD Microtainer; Contact-Activated Lancet, Plymouth, UK) using a volumetric micropipette (Rainin, Oakland, CA), whereas venous blood was collected into tubes containing EDTA (BD Vacutainer, Plymouth, UK). Plasma from venous blood was obtained after centrifugation at 2,500_rpm for 10_min and stored together with dried DBS cards at _20 C.

Analytical methods. The cocktail substrates and their CYP-specific metabolites were quantified in plasma and DBS using a single reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry method operating in dual electrospray ionization mode, as previously described.15 The substances of interest were extracted from DBS samples using methanol, whereas protein precipitation using acetonitrile was used for plasma extraction. Both methods (those for DBS and plasma) were fully validated according to international criteria.15

Genotyping. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood (200 l) using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Switzerland). The detection of CYP2C19 (alleles *2 and *3) and 33 CYP2D6 alleles was performed using the AmpliChip CYP450 test (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) as previously described.49 CYP2B6*6 and CYP2C19*17 genotypes were determined using commercially available TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 genotypes, as well as ABCB1 G2677T/A and C3435T polymorphisms, were determined by means of multiplex PCR with fluorescent probes (Lightmix; TibMolbiol, Berlin, Germany) and melting curve analysis on a LightCycler480 (Roche Diagnostics).

Data analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by standard noncompartmental methods using WinNonlin version 6.2.1 (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). The results are presented as mean values ( SD) and geometric mean ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Single-point MRs were determined as the concentration ratio between the metabolite and the administered substance, i.e., par/caf, OH-bup/bup, OH-flb/flb, OH-opz/opz, dor/dem, and OH-mdz/mdz, at different time points. MRs at the inhibition or induction sessions were compared with those of the cocktail-alone session using a nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlation between AUC ratios and single-point MRs was established using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 21 (Chicago, IL). P values  0.05 were considered statistically significant."

17,16232205,Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic study of drug administered once every 21 days.,"drug is a novel drug anticancer drug that disrupts the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. The objectives of this phase I study of drug were to estimate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), to determine the recommended dose for phase II, and to clarify the pharmacokinetic profile of drug and its relation to polymorphisms of CYP2C9 (*2, *3) and CYP2C19 (*2, *3) in Japanese patients. Patients received 1-2-h i.v. infusions of drug (400, 600, 700, 800 or 900 drug/m2) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Twenty-one patients received between one and eight cycles of drug. The dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) comprised leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, elevation of aspartate aminotransferase, colitis, and ileus. The mean area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) for successive dose levels increased in a drug-dose-proportional manner. Two patients were heterozygous for the CYP2C9 mutation. For CYP2C19, eight patients were wild type and the remainder had heterozygous (n = 8) or homozygous mutations (n = 5). Regarding the CYP2C19 genotype, the AUC of patients with mutant alleles were higher than those of patients with wild type at a dose of 600 drug/m2 or more. The severity of toxic effects, such as myelosuppression, seemed to depend on the AUC. drug partial responses were observed. One patient treated at a dose of 700 drug/m2 experienced a drug tumor volume reduction of 22.5%. The MTD was estimated to be 900 drug/m2. A dose of 800 drug/m2 is recommended for further phase II studies. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of drug seemed to be influenced by CYP2C19 genotype. The observed safety profile and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity warrant further investigation of this drug in monotherapy or in drug drug.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal

18,11851639,"Effect of chronic drug administration on the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and N-acetyltransferase in healthy human subjects.","Short-term drug administration has been shown to selectively inhibit CYP2E1 activity but the effects of chronic drug administration on the activities of drug metabolizing drug is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of drug given for 11 days on selected drug metabolizing enzyme activities. Seven healthy volunteers were given drug 250 drug daily for 11 days. Activities of the drug metabolizing drug CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and N-acetyltransferase were determined using the probe drug drug, mephenytoin, drug, drug, and drug, respectively. drug was administered before drug administration and after the second and eleventh doses of drug, while the other probe drug were given before drug administration and after the eleventh drug dose. drug administration markedly inhibited drug 6-hydroxylation by more than 95%, but did not affect metabolism of drug or mephenytoin. drug N3-demethylation was decreased by 34% (P < 0.05). drug concentrations were markedly elevated by drug administration resulting in a nearly 16-fold increase in the drug acetylation index, calculated as the drug concentration ratio of drug to drug. CYP-mediated drug N-hydroxylation was not significantly altered. These data suggest that drug-mediated inhibition is predominantly drug for CYP2E1. The magnitude of CYP2E1 inhibition was similar after both acute and chronic drug administration. The effects on drug N3-demethylation (CYP1A2) and drug metabolism suggest that chronic drug administration may affect multiple drug metabolizing drug, which could potentially complicate the use of chronically administered drug as a diagnostic inhibitor of CYP2E1.",Journal Article,None,Methods Eight drug healthy male volunteers agreed participate study providing written informed consent This study approved local Institutional Review Board All subjects nonsmokers self reported healthy confirmed medical history physical examination drug chemistries urinalysis Subjects instructed abstain drug drug containing products least two days study visit none subjects receiving counter drug drug Subjects received probe drug drug 250_mg three occasions prior drug administration second daily drug dose eleventh daily drug dose Subjects also received drug drug probe drug drug 100_mg drug 100_mg drug 10_mg mephenytoin 100_mg prior drug administration eleventh daily dose Subjects received drug 250_mg orally morning doses administered clinic personnel All probe drug given orally eight ounces drug morning overnight fast The five probe drug administered simultaneously cocktail previously shown devoid interaction doses used In session heparinized drug samples collected prior drug administration 10_h probe administration Urine collected 0 8_h container ascorbic drug preservative unstable drug hydroxylamine metabolite drug harvested centrifugation urine aliquots stored frozen _20_ _C analysed Analytical techniques The following drug metabolites measured high performance drug chromatographic techniques described previously drug paraxanthine drug drug 6 hydroxychlorzoxazone drug 6 hydroxychlorzoxazone urine drug DDS drug hydroxylamine HDA urine drug drug drug drug DB 4 hydroxydebrisoquine HDB urine 4_ hydroxymephenytoin HMP urine The within between day coefficients variation assays  10 All assay procedures utilized study tested probe drug metabolites ensure analytical interference would occur simultaneous administration Data analysis drug 6 hydroxychlorzoxazone pharmacokinetic data presented detail previously In report drug metabolic ratio calculated concentration ratio 6 hydroxychlorzoxazone drug 4_h drug sample used index CYP2E1 activity The concentration paraxanthine dimethylxanthine divided concentration drug 8_h drug sample used assess CYP1A2 activity The ability N hydroxylate drug CYP mediated estimated urinary recovery ratio equation image HDA urinary recovery drug hydroxylamine 8_h urine sample DDS 8_h urinary recovery drug Acetylator phenotype defined ratio drug drug 8_h drug sample subjects acetylation ratio greater classified drug acetylators The area concentration time curve AUC drug drug 10_h drug administration calculated trapezoidal rule The activity CYP2D6 estimated using drug recovery ratio equation image HDB DB urinary recoveries 4 hydroxydebrisoquine drug 8_h respectively The total urinary recovery 4_ hydroxymephenytoin  mol used phenotypic measure CYP2C19 activity Statistical analysis Data presented median range Statistical test values Hodges Lehmann estimates median differences exact confidence intervals Computations performed using StatXact Cytel Software Corporation USA Differences considered statistically significant confidence intervals excluded zero
19,21726410,Effects of the CYP2C9*1/*13 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of drug.,"drug is extensively metabolized by CYP2C9, and a CYP2C9*13 is one of the principal variant alleles in East Asian populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CYP2C9*1/*13 on the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug in healthy individuals. A single drug dose of 8 drug drug was given to 22 Korean volunteers with different CYP2C9 genotypes (8, 8 and 6 carriers of CYP2C9*1/*1, *1/*3 and *1/*13 genotypes, respectively). drug and 5'-hydroxylornoxicam levels were analysed using HPLC-UV in drug samples collected up to 24 hr after taking the drug. In individuals with CYP2C9*1/*13, drug had a higher C(max) (p < 0.001), a longer half-life (p < 0.001), a lower drug clearance (p < 0.001) and a higher area under the drug concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC(drug) ) than in CYP2C9*1/*1 individuals (p < 0.001). The C(max) and AUC(drug) of 5'-hydroxylornoxicam were lower in CYP2C9*1/*13 individuals than in CYP2C9*1/*1 individuals, but the half-life of 5'-hydroxylornoxicam did not differ between the two groups. The half-life, drug clearance and AUC(drug) of drug were similar in individuals with CYP2C9*1/*13 and those with CYP2C9*1/*3. The C(max) , half-life and AUC(drug) of 5'-hydroxylornoxicam were also similar in both groups, although C(max) was higher in CYP2C9*1/*13 individuals (p < 0.01).

20,29411268,"A Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Study of drug Bitartrate Delayed-Release Capsules Following drug Administration with Orange Juice, drug, or drug in Cystinosis.","Cystinosis is a rare, metabolic, autosomal recessive, genetic lysosomal storage disorder characterized by an accumulation of drug in drug organs and tissues. drug bitartrate (CB) is a drug-depleting aminothiol drug approved in the United States and Europe in immediate-release and delayed-release (DR) formulations for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in children and adults. It is recommended that CBDR be administered with fruit juice (except drug juice) for drug drug. drug is a drug pump inhibitor that inhibits gastric drug secretion and, theoretically, may cause the premature release of drug by increasing intragastric pH, thereby affecting the PK of CBDR. This open-label, three-period, randomized study in healthy adult subjects was designed primarily to compare the pharmacokinetics of CBDR capsules after a single drug dose administered with orange juice, drug, or multiple drug doses of drug with drug at steady state. A total of 32 subjects were randomly assigned to receive study agents in one of two treatment sequences. All subjects completed the study and baseline characteristics of the overall population and the two treatment sequence populations were similar. Peak mean drug drug concentrations following co-administration of CBDR capsules with orange juice (1892 drug/drug) were higher compared with co-administration with drug (1663 drug/drug) or drug 20 drug and drug (1712 drug/drug). Mean time to peak drug concentration was shorter with drug co-administration (2.5 h) compared with orange juice (3.5 h) or drug (3.0 h). Statistical comparisons between treatment groups indicated that exposure as assessed by AUC Overall, the pharmacokinetics of drug bitartrate DR capsules are not significantly impacted by co-administration with orange juice, drug only, or drug (with drug).

21,28865153,Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential of drug (drug 197) using cocktail probes in patients with advanced solid tumours.,"This phase 1, open-label, crossover study sought to evaluate drug-drug interactions between drug and drug P450 (CYP) substrates and drug and P-glycoprotein. The effect of drug doses on the pharmacokinetics of the probe drug for CYP1A2 (drug), CYP2C9 (S-drug), CYP2C19 (drug), and drug (drug), and for P-glycoprotein (drug) was investigated in 28 patients with advanced cancer using a cocktail probe approach. Patients received single doses of probe drug alone and, after 5 days of treatment, with drug 360 drug twice daily. The ratios of geometric least squares mean (90% confidence interval) for the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration in the presence/absence of drug were 0.97 (0.89-1.05) for drug, 0.88 (0.76-1.02) for S-drug, 0.89 (0.60-1.31) for drug, 0.83 (0.67-1.02) for drug, and 0.69 (0.51-0.94) for drug. Similar effects were observed for drug drug concentrations; the ratio for drug in the presence/absence of drug was 0.75 (0.60-0.95). The data suggest that drug 360 drug twice daily has either a minimal or drug effect on the pharmacokinetics of probe drug for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and drug substrates, and decreases the systemic exposure of P-glycoprotein substrates when administered with drug.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal Article",PMC5736844,Methods This Phase crossover study ClinicalTrials gov Identifier NCT01517399

22,27518170,Evaluation of a Potential Metabolism-Mediated drug-drug Interaction Between drug and drug in Healthy Volunteers.,"To evaluate the impact of drug on the pharmacokinetic profile of drug and its main active metabolite (glucuronidated form), 4-hydroxyatomoxetine-O-glucuronide, in healthy volunteers. An open-label, drug-randomized, two-period, sequential clinical trial was conducted as follows: during Period I (Reference), each volunteer received a single drug dose of 25 drug drug, whilst during Period II (Test), a drug of 25 drug drug and 300 drug drug was administered to all volunteers, after a pretreatment regimen with drug for 7 days. Next, after determining drug and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine-O-glucuronide drug concentrations, their pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental method and subsequently compared to determine any statistically significant differences between the two periods. drug intake influenced all the pharmacokinetic parameters of both drug and its metabolite. For drug, Cmax increased from 226 96.1 to 386 137 drug/drug and more importantly, AUC0-  was significantly increasedfrom 1580 1040 to 8060 4160 drug*h/drug, while the mean t1/2 was prolonged after drug pretreatment. For 4-hydroxyatomoxetine-O-glucuronide, Cmax and AUC0-   were decreased from 707 269 to 212 145 drug/drug and from 5750 1240 to 3860 1220 drug*h/drug, respectively. These results demonstrated that the effect of drug on CYP2D6 activity was responsible for an increased systemic exposure to drug (5.1-fold) and also for a decreased exposure to its main metabolite (1.5-fold). Additional studies are required in order to evaluate the clinical relevance of this pharmacokinetic drug interaction.This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

23,7586928,drug: a new drug substrate for the polymorphic CYP2D6 in humans.,"The drug drug (DHC) is frequently used as an drug and drug drug. However, until now there have been drug detailed data on drug metabolism in humans. We therefore investigated pathways that contribute to elimination of drug, and we tested the hypothesis that drug O-demethylation to drug (DHM) is catalyzed by the polymorphic CYP2D6. A single drug dose of drug was administered to six extensive (metabolic ratio [MR] < or = 1), two intermediate (1 < MR < 20) and six poor metabolizers (MR > or = 20) of drug/debrisoquin. Serum concentrations of drug and drug were measured up to 25 hours, and urinary excretion of conjugated and unconjugated drug, drug, and drug were determined. There were drug differences in the pharmacokinetics of drug between extensive and poor metabolizers. However, the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), partial metabolic clearance, and total urinary recovery of drug were significantly lower in poor metabolizers (10.3 +/- 6.1 nmol.hr/L; 7.0 +/- 4.1 drug/min; 1.3% +/- 0.9% of dose) compared with extensive metabolizers (75.5 +/- 42.9 nmol.hr/L; 49.7 +/- 29.9 drug/min; 8.9% +/- 6.2%; p < 0.01). There was a strong correlation between the AUCDHC/AUCDHM ratio and the urinary metabolic ratio of drug (rS = 0.89, p = 0.001). drug significant differences between extensive and poor metabolizers were detected in urine for conjugated drug (extensive metabolizers, 27.7% of dose; poor metabolizers, 31.5%), unconjugated drug (extensive metabolizers, 31.1%; poor metabolizers, 31.1%), conjugated drug (extensive metabolizers, 6.3%; poor metabolizers, 5.4%), or unconjugated drug (extensive metabolizers, 15.8%; poor metabolizers, 19.5%). drug O-demethylation to drug is impaired in poor metabolizers of drug.

24,27552251,"Use of a cocktail probe to assess potential drug interactions with drug P450 after administration of drug, a costimulatory drug.","This open-label study investigated the effect of drug on cytokine levels and on the pharmacokinetics of drug, drug, drug, drug and drug, as CYP probe substrates after drug administration of the Inje cocktail in healthy volunteers. Twenty-two evaluable subjects received the Inje cocktail on Days 1, 4, 7 and 11 and drug infusion on Day 4. Since drug caused drug major alterations to cytokine levels, there were drug major effects on CYP-substrate pharmacokinetics, except for a slight (16-30%) increase in drug exposure, which was probably due to drug-mediated, time-dependent CYP inhibition. drug did not cause major alterations in the pharmacokinetics, as measured by the geometric mean ratios and associated 90% confidence interval for area under the drug concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity on Day 7 comparing administration with and without drug for drug (1.002 [0.914, 1.098]), drug (1.031 [0.885, 1.200]), drug (1.016 [0.938, 1.101)], drug (0.968 [0.892, 1.049]) or their respective metabolites.

We also aimed to explore the optimal dosing regimens for patients who developed invasive fungal infections. A total of 105 patients (342 concentrations) were included prospectively in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Nonlinear mixed-effects models were developed using Phoenix NLME software. Dosing simulations were performed based on the final model. A one-compartment model with first-order drug and elimination was used to characterize drug pharmacokinetics. Population estimates of clearance, volume of distribution and drug bioavailability were 2.88 l h Using a drug of CYP2C19 genotype and postoperative time to determine the initial drug dosing regimens

28,27154174,"A clinical drug-drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of a drug-pump inhibitor, a combined P-glycoprotein/drug 450 enzyme (CYP)3A4 inhibitor, and a CYP2C9 inhibitor on the pharmacokinetics of drug.","The drug pathway inhibitor drug exhibits pH-dependent solubility, and in vitro studies have shown that drug is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is metabolized by drug P450 (CYP) 2C9 and 3A4. The objective of this four-arm parallel study in healthy subjects was to evaluate the effect of the drug-pump inhibitor drug, the P-gp/drug inhibitor drug, and the CYP2C9 and 3A4 inhibitor drug on drug steady-state pharmacokinetics. Cohorts included a control arm (n = 22), in which drug 150 drug was administered once daily (QD) for 7 days, and 3 arms in which drug was co-administered QD for 7 days with drug 20 drug (including a 4-day lead-in; n = 24); drug 200 drug (n = 22); or drug 400 drug (n = 22). Area under the drug concentration-time curve from zero to 24 h (AUC0-24h) at steady state was lower with concomitant drug administration relative to drug alone [geometric mean ratio (GMR), 86.2 (associated 90 % confidence interval [drug], 76.1, 97.7)]. There was drug effect of drug on steady-state exposure of drug [GMR, 96.4 (90 % drug 84.9, 109.6)]. Co-administration with drug increased drug steady-state AUC0-24h [GMR, 130.9 (90 % drug 115.2, 148.7)]. Co-administration of drug, drug, and drug had similar effects on the exposure of unbound drug and total drug. The results of this study suggest that drug can be administered with drug-reducing agents and P-gp and CYP inhibitors without the risk of a clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction.

29,23520311,drug increases linezolid exposure in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients.,"The use of linezolid for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is limited by dose- and time-dependent toxicity. Recently, we reported a case of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between linezolid and drug that resulted in increased linezolid exposure. The aim of this prospective pharmacokinetic study is to quantify the effect of drug on the exposure of linezolid. Subjects were included in an open-label, single-centre, single-arm, fixed-order pharmacokinetic interaction study. All subjects received 300 drug linezolid twice daily during the entire study, consecutively co-administered with 250 drug and 500 drug drug once daily. Steady-state serum curves of linezolid and drug were analysed using validated methods, and differences between pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Linezolid exposure increased by a median (interquartile range) of 44% (23-102%, p=0.043) after co-administration of 500 drug drug (n=5) compared to baseline, whereas 250 drug drug had drug statistically significant effect. Co-administration was well tolerated by most patients; none experienced severe adverse effects. One patient reported common toxicity criteria grade 2 gastrointestinal adverse events. In this study, we showed that drug significantly increased linezolid serum exposure after combining drug with linezolid in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients. The drug-drug interaction is possibly P-glycoprotein-mediated. Due to large interpatient variability, therapeutic drug monitoring is advisable to determine individual effect size.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,Method

30,8582470,Lack of relationship between drug pharmacokinetics and the drug oxidation polymorphism.,"drug is a very potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, but the role of the enzyme in the biotransformation of drug has only been investigated in a single in vitro study and in two small in vivo experiments, with contradictory results. The present investigation was designed to present definite evaluation of whether drug is metabolised by CYP2D6. Eight poor metabolizers (PM) and 8 extensive metabolizers (EM) of drug each took one drug dose of 200 drug drug. In the EM, the total clearance, the clearance via 3-hydroxylation and the clearance via N-oxidation, were 33, 3.7 and 0.23 l.h-1, respectively. In the PM, the corresponding values were 29, 3.1 and 0.18 l.h-1, respectively. There were drug statistically significant differences between EM and PM in any of these pharmacokinetic parameters.

32,9776437,Influence of the drug P4502D6*4 allele on the pharmacokinetics of controlled-release drug.,"The aim of the present paper was to compare the pharmacokinetics of drug in homozygous Caucasian volunteers for the wild-type CYP2D6 allele (CYP2D6*1/CYP2D6*1) and heterozygous (CYP2D6*1/CYP2D6*4) Caucasians. Thirty-six unrelated healthy male Caucasians were screened for two of the most frequently occurring mutant alleles (CYP2D6*3 and CYP2D6*4) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty-four volunteers with a genotype suggesting a drug hydroxylator phenotype were enrolled in a bioequivalence trial and each received in a randomized, cross-drug fashion one of the three formulations compared. Each formulation contained 200 drug drug tartrate/(tablet). In each of the three periods of the trial, one of the formulations was administered under fasting conditions in the morning on 4 consecutive days. drug for quantification of drug was drawn immediately before the last dose and in selected time intervals thereafter. A sensitive and specific high-performance drug chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection was applied for the quantification of drug. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for each subject and statistically compared in two groups of 16 homozygous (CYP2D6*1/CYP2D6*1) and six heterozygous (CYP2D6*1/CYP2D6*4) volunteers. Significant differences between homozygous and heterozygous individuals were observed for all pharmacokinetic parameters. The AUC in the course of one those interval of 24 h (AUCtau), minium steady-state concentration (C(min)ss) and average steady-state concentration (C(av)ss) values for heterozygous individuals were more than twice those of individuals. Significantly higher values for C(max)ss, t1/2, half-value drug (HVD) and mean residence time (MRT) were also observed in heterozygous volunteers.

33,8971425,Involvement of CYP2D6 but not CYP2C19 in drug metabolism in humans.,"1. drug, an drug derivative previously used as a drug, has gained a new indication in treating the symptoms of senile dementia. 2. drug is rapidly hydrolysed to an drug derivative, 1-methyl-10-drug-methoxy-9,10-dihydrolysergol (MMDL), which is further N-demethylated to form 10-drug-methoxy-9,10-dihydrolysergol (MDL). A few individuals display aberrant metabolism of this drug, as shown by their diminished capacity to form the MDL metabolite. The aim of this study was to determine whether defective drug metabolism is associated with the drug and/or the S-mephenytoin hydroxylation polymorphisms. 3. After a single, drug 30 drug dose of drug, the drug concentrations of its two metabolites were studied in 15 subjects, divided into three groups with respect to their drug and S-mephenytoin hydroxylation phenotypes. 4. The pharmacokinetic parameters of MMDL and MDL were similar in the drug subjects who were extensive metabolisers of drug (five of whom were poor metabolisers of S-mephenytoin) (mean MMDL Cmax 59 nmol l-1 and AUC (0, th) 144 nmol l-1h, mean MDL Cmax 183 nmol l-1 and AUC 2627 nmol l-1h) but were markedly different from the five subjects who were poor metabolisers of drug (mean MMDL Cmax 356 nmol l-1 and AUC 10512 nmol l-1h, MDL concentrations below limit of quantitation). 5. We drug that the formation of MDL from MMDL in the metabolism of drug is catalysed to a major extent by CYP2D6 and that the observed interindividual variation in the metabolic pattern of the drug is related to the drug hydroxylation polymorphism.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,The pharmacokinetic evaluation carried means pharmacokinetic software TopFit The following parameters determined subject drug AUC course one dose interval h AUCs half value drug HVD  per cent peak trough  uctuation PTF minimum steady state concentration Css min average steady state concentration Css av elimination half life t1 2 mean residence time MRT All parameters listed determined model independent way HVD de ned time span within dosing cycle serum concentration deviated drug concentration less The PTF calculated follows PTF  Css max   Css min Cav whereby Cav  AUC The pharmacokinetic parameters drug homozygous heterozygous individuals compared means Wilcoxon rank sum test di erence medians relatively small number observations per group The pharmacokinetic evaluation carried means pharmacokinetic software TopFit The following parameters determined subject drug AUC course one dose interval h AUCs half value drug HVD  per cent peak trough  uctuation PTF minimum steady state concentration Css min average steady state concentration Css av elimination half life t1 2 mean residence time MRT All parameters listed determined model independent way HVD de ned time span within dosing cycle serum concentration deviated drug concentration less The PTF calculated follows PTF  Css max   Css min Cav whereby Cav  AUC The pharmacokinetic parameters drug homozygous heterozygous individuals compared means Wilcoxon rank sum test di erence medians relatively small number observations per group

35,17495881,"drug disposition and ABCB1 (MDR1, P-glycoprotein) genotype.","The aim of this study was to explore the impact of individual variation in drug elimination on drug disposition. Twenty-two patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor or chronic myeloid leukemia initially received drug 600 drug daily with dosage subsequently toxicity adjusted. Pharmacokinetic parameters on day 1 and at steady-state were compared with elimination phenotype and single-nucleotide polymorphisms of CYP3A5 and ABCB1. A fivefold variation in estimated drug clearance (CL/F) was present on day 1 and mean CL/F had fallen by 26% at steady state. This reduction in drug CL/F was associated with ABCB1 genotype, being least apparent in thymidine homozygotes at the 1236T>C, 2677G>T/A and 3435C>T loci. Toxicity-related dose reduction also tended to be less common in these individuals. ABCB1 genotype was associated with steady-state CL/F due to an apparent genotype-specific influence of drug on elimination. Further evaluation of ABCB1 genotype and drug dosage is warranted.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,"METHODS
Patients with either GIST with immunohistochemical documentation

/l, hemoglobin 49 g/l, no known primary liver
disease and no other severe or uncontrolled concurrent medical
condition. None of the patients in this study were taking medications
known to inhibit or induce CYP3A or ABCB1.
Patients in this study were included in two previous published
reports.17,11 The study was approved by the Human Research and
Ethics Committee of Sydney West Area Health Service and informed
consent was obtained from participants.
Imatinib treatment. All patients received a fixed dose of imatinib
(GLIVECs Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia Pty Rd, North Ryde,
Australia), 600 mg pd as 100 mg capsules, taken with food in the
morning. Dose reductions were allowed based on toxicity but dose
escalation was not allowed.
Imatinib pharmacokinetics. Imatinib pharmacokinetic assessment
was undertaken on day 1 and steady state. Steady-state concentrations were measured after a minimum of 26 days of treatment;
actual steady-state measurements were made after a median of 29
days (min.: 26 days; max.: 107 days). Pharmacokinetic assessment
was undertaken at Westmead Hospital for all patients.
A limited blood sampling regimen was used with accurately
timed blood samples taken pre-dose and then at approximately 1.5,
3, 6, and 24 h after imatinib administration. Plasma concentrations
of imatinib and the major active metabolite CGP74588 were
determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry method.4 The lower limit of quantification of imatinib
and the metabolite was 4 ng/ml. Assay accuracy (% of nominal) and
precision (standard deviation for replicate analyses) at the lower
limit of quantification were, respectively, 104 and 5.64% for imatinib
and 99.2 and 4.19% for the metabolite. Accuracy and precision over
the two assays entire concentration range from 4 to 10,000 ng/ml,
respectively, was from 98.9 to 108% and 4.56 to 5.09% for imatinib,
and from 94.1 to 106% and 3.75 to 5.07% for the metabolite.4
Posterior Bayesian estimates of clearance were determined for
each patient using a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with
first-order input (P-Pharm Version 1.5, Innaphase, Philadelphia,
PA). AUC was calculated for imatinib on day 1 (AUC0N) and at
steady state (AUCss). The AUC of CGP74588 was estimated on day 1
(AUC0N,M) and steady state (AUCss,M) using a population
approach. The mean (7SD) for day 1 imatinib AUC 024 h and
extrapolated AUC0N were 47.4 (734) and 55.3 (734) mg h/ml,
respectively. The use of sparse sampling and extrapolation to infinity
in this study is supported by another study that used more extensive
sampling points including 24, 32, and 48 h post dose which gave
similar day 1 imatinib AUC results (AUC 024 h 39.7725.9 and
AUC0N of 52.4733.7).4

Hepatic technetium labeled sestamibi (99mTc-MIBI) clearance. Within 7 days before commencement of treatment and within 7 days of
steady-state pharmacokinetic measurements, hepatic elimination of
99mTc-MIBI was determined and interpreted as an indicator of
ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, MDR1) activity. An elimination rate
constant (kH) for 99mTc-MIBI was determined as described
previously11 and was used in comparisons with genotype.11 Hepatic 99mTc-MIBI clearance (kH*liver volume) was used for comparison
with drug clearance with liver volume estimated from body surface
area18,19 as described previously.20
Erythromycin breath test. EBT was undertaken within 7 days of
commencement of imatinib and repeated within 7 days of imatinib
steady-state measurement using a previously described method.21
The parameters used to represent erythromycin clearance included
the flux of expired 14CO2 at 20 min (C20) and the inverse of the time
to maximum 14CO2 flux (1/Tmax).21,22 The EBT was interpreted as
an indicator of both ABCB1 and CYP3A activity.
Midazolam clearance. Oral midazolam clearance, as an indicator of
CYP3A activity, was evaluated within 7 days before the commencement of treatment as described previously.17
CYP 3A5 and ABCB1 SNP analysis. Presence of the CYP3A5*1 allele
encoding active CYP3A5 and the truncating CYP3A5*3 allele as well
as common SNPs in ABCB1 (MDR1): exon 12 1236T4C, exon 21
2677G4T/A and exon 26 3435C4T were detected as described
previously.17,11
Statistical considerations. The primary objective of this study was
to evaluate the relationships between ABCB1 genotype and imatinib
CL/F. A priori, it was estimated that a sample size of 20 patients
would be sufficient to detect a correlation with 95% confidence and
90% power for a single SNP.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v 12.0 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL). Significance level was set at 5% and two-sided tests
were used throughout. Day 1 and steady-state measures were
compared by paired t-test. The Spearmans rank correlation was
used to quantify the association between continuous variables. The
Jonckheere-Terpstra non-parametric test was used to test for an
association between ABCB1 and CYP3A5 genotypes and clearance
parameters with heterozygotes arranged as the middle group.
Imatinib clearance in subjects with GIST or CML was compared
by MannWhitney test. Logistic regression was used to determine
the relationship between genotype and dose reduction. Repeated
measure analysis of variance was used to investigate the relationship
between within-patient change from day 1 to steady state and the
presence of TT genotypes at the three ABCB1 loci examined. Odds
ratios were used to quantify the degree of association between TT
genotype and dose reduction. All analyses were exploratory and
therefore no adjustments for multiple comparisons have been made."
36,23325481,Effect of concomitant administration of drug chloride extended release on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy adults.,"Overactive bladder (OAB) is often associated with a number of co-morbid medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus. This may necessitate several concomitant treatments, thus creating the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs). drug is renally eliminated, not metabolized via drug P450; therefore, drug P450 DDIs are unlikely. However, coadministration with another renally eliminated drug (e.g., drug) may theoretically result in a drug. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (drug and urine) and safety/tolerability of the coadministration of drug chloride extended release (XR) and drug under steady-state conditions in healthy male and female subjects. In a single-centre, randomized, open-label, two-group, two-period study in healthy males and females aged 18-45 years, 44 subjects received drug drug 500 drug twice daily for 3.5 days during one period, and drug drug chloride XR 60 drug once daily for 10 days, followed by drug chloride XR 60 drug once daily for 4 days plus drug 500 drug twice daily for 3.5 days during the other period. The two periods occurred in a crossover fashion, separated by a 3-day washout period. drug chloride XR coadministration did not alter drug steady-state pharmacokinetics. drug coadministration reduced drug steady-state drug drug concentration (by 34 %) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0-24 hours (by 29 %). Neither drug's renal clearance was affected. drug safety/tolerability issues of concern were observed with coadministration. drug dosage adjustment is necessary for drug when coadministered with drug chloride XR.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC3561611,Methods This single centre randomized open label two period crossover study Fig enrolled

37,9010701,"drug and drug in extensive and poor metabolizers of drug: pharmacokinetics, drug effect and side effects.","drug O-demethylation to drug is catalysed by the genetic polymorphic drug oxygenase (CYP2D6). The objective of the present study was to assess the drug effect of drug on different types of experimental pain in relation to drug phenotype. Fourteen extensive (EMs) and 14 poor metabolizers (PMs) of drug completed a randomized, double-blind, three-way, cross-drug study with a single drug dose of drug (75 or 100 drug) against drug (20 or 30 drug) and placebo. Pain tests performed before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after drug included the cold pressor test and pain thresholds for heat and pressure stimulation. Adverse effects were rated by a structured interview. After drug, drug and drug-6-glucuronide were present in equal amounts in drug of PMs and EMs. After drug, neither drug nor drug-6-glucuronide could be detected in 13 of the 14 PMs, whereas at least one of the compounds could be detected in all EMs. Peak pain and discomfort rated on a VAS scale during the cold pressor test were significantly reduced by drug in both EMs and PMs, with a median peak change of 8.5 and 7.0 mm, respectively, for peak pain, and 11.5 and 15.5 mm, respectively, for discomfort. drug only reduced these pain measures significantly in EMs, with a median peak change of 5.5 mm for peak pain and 10.5 mm for discomfort. Pain detection and tolerance thresholds to heat and pressure were not consistently altered by either drug or drug. In PMs, adverse effects were significantly more pronounced on drug than on drug and only showed a slight difference between drug and placebo. In EMs, there was drug difference between drug and drug and more pronounced adverse effects on both drug as compared to placebo. This study confirms that drug O-demethylation depends on CYP2D6; it shows that the 6-glucuronidation of drug is independent of CYP2D6; it supports the theory that the drug effect of drug depends on its O-demethylation; and it indicates that this is probably also the case for the adverse effects. The results lend drug support to the suggestion of a drug-drug drug effect of drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,Subjects

38,11929404,Comparison of drug and drug for gastric drug inhibition during the daytime and night-time in different CYP2C19 genotype groups.,"The drug inhibitory effect of drug depends on the S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C19) genotype status. The effect of drug is independent of this genotype. To investigate the drug inhibitory effects of drug vs. drug during the daytime and night-time with reference to different CYP2C19 genotypes. Fifteen healthy volunteers were given 20 drug drug twice a day or 30 drug drug once a day for 8 days. On post-dose day 8, 24-h intragastric pH monitoring was performed. During the daytime, the intragastric pH with drug was significantly higher than that with drug in the heterozygous extensive metabolizer group, whereas drug significant difference was observed in the homozygous extensive metabolizer group. During the night-time, the intragastric pH with drug was quite similar to that with drug in the heterozygous extensive metabolizer and poor metabolizer groups. However, during the night-time, the intragastric pH with drug was significantly higher than that with drug in the homozygous extensive metabolizer group. An insufficient drug inhibition by drug during the night-time in the homozygous extensive metabolizer group could be compensated for by drug.

39,24602137,"Effects of drug, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in healthy volunteers.","drug is a third generation P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor currently under development. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of a single dose of drug on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drug, a P-gp substrate, and to compare them with those of drug. Eighteen healthy male subjects were administered drug alone (period 1) or with drug plus drug or drug in period 2 or 3, respectively. In period 3, subjects randomly received one of three drug doses: 15, 60 or 180_mg. Changes in pupil size, alertness, drug saturation and the drug bioavailability of drug were assessed in each period. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of drug were determined. Pupil size, alertness and drug saturation did not change drug time when drug alone or drug plus drug was administered while drug significantly increased the systemic exposure to drug, i.e. the geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) of AUC(0,tlast ) for drug with and without drug was 1.48 (1.08, 2.02). Co-administered drug significantly increased the systemic exposure to drug 2.2-fold (1.53, 3.18), which also markedly reduced pupil size, resulting in a decrease of 24.7_mm_h in the area under the effect curve of pupil size change from baseline compared with drug alone. drug inhibits P-gp mainly in the intestinal endothelium, which can be beneficial because pan-inhibition of P-gp, particularly in the brain, could lead to detrimental adverse events. Further studies are warranted to investigate adequately the dose-exposure relationship of drug, along with its drug of effect.","Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial

41,19094160,"Influence of domperidone on pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of the drug agonist drug.","drug transdermal patch is a new drug-ergolinic drug agonist developed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome. Peripheral dopaminergic side-effects of drug agonists such as nausea and vomiting can be prevented by the drug drug domperidone. The study results show drug evidence for an interaction of domperidone on bioavailability and steady-state pharmacokinetics of transdermal drug. Co-administration of domperidone and drug does not require dose adjustments for drug transdermal patch. To evaluate the influence of the drug drug domperidone on steady-state pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of multiple-dose treatment of the transdermally applied drug-ergolinic drug agonist drug. Sixteen healthy male subjects (mean age 30.3 years) participated in a randomized, two-way crossover clinical trial. Treatment A consisted of transdermal drug patch (2 drug (24 h)(-1), 10 cm(2), total drug content 4.5 drug) applied daily for 4 days, and concomitant drug domperidone (10 drug t.i.d.) for 5 days. For treatment B, subjects received only transdermal drug treatment (daily for 4 days). Pharmacokinetic variables describing systemic exposure and renal elimination of drug and metabolites, and safety and tolerability of the treatment were assessed. The primary steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters (C(max,ss) and AUC((0-24),ss)) were similar with or without co-administration of domperidone. Geometric mean ratios were close to 1 and respective 90% confidence intervals were within the acceptance range of bioequivalence (0.8, 1.25): C(max,ss) 0.96 (0.86, 1.08) and AUC((0-24),ss) 0.97 (0.87, 1.08). t(max,ss), t(1/2), secondary parameters calculated on days 4/5 after repeated patch application (C(min,ss), C(ave,ss), AUC((0-tz))) and renal elimination for unconjugated drug and its metabolites were also similar with and without comedication of domperidone. A reduction in the dopaminergic side-effect nausea was seen with domperidone comedication. drug changes of pharmacokinetic parameters describing systemic exposure and renal elimination of drug were observed when domperidone was administered concomitantly with drug.

Prospective, open-label, single-dose pharmacokinetic study. University of Colorado Hospital Clinical and Translational Research Center. Healthy African-American volunteers between 21 and 60 years of age were enrolled in the study based on CYP2C8 genotype: CYP2C8*1/*1 (9 participants), CYP2C8*1/*2 (7 participants), and CYP2C8*2/*2 (1 participant). Participants received a single 15-drug dose of drug in the fasted state, followed by a 48-hour pharmacokinetic study. drug concentrations of drug and its M-III (keto) and M-IV (hydroxy) metabolites were compared between participants with the CYP2C8*1/*1 genotype and CYP2C8*2 carriers. drug area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC)0-  and half-life (t1/2 ) did not differ significantly between CYP2C8*1/*1 and CYP2C8*2 carriers (AUC0-  7331 2846 vs 10431 5090 drug*h/drug, p=0.15, t1/2 7.4 2.7 vs 10.5 4.0 h, p=0.07). M-III and M-IV AUC0-48 also did not differ significantly between genotype groups. However, the M-III:drug AUC0-48 ratio was significantly lower in CYP2C8*2 carriers than CYP2C8*1 homozygotes (0.70 0.15 vs 1.2 0.37, p=0.006). Similarly, CYP2C8*2 carriers had a significantly lower M-III:M-IV AUC0-48 ratio than participants with the CYP2C8*1/*1 genotype (0.82 0.26 vs 1.22 0.26, p=0.006). These data suggest that CYP2C8*2 influences drug pharmacokinetics in vivo, particularly the AUC0-48 ratio of M-III:parent drug, and the AUC0-48 ratio of M-III:M-IV. Larger studies are needed to further investigate the impact of CYP2C8*2 on the pharmacokinetics of CYP2C8 substrates in individuals of African descent.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research

43,22900583,Pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug in healthy volunteers.,"The new drug-aggregating drug drug is bioactivated by cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3A and 2B6. drug is a potent CYP3A inhibitor and was shown in vitro as a CYP2B6 inhibitor. The aim of this open-label cross-drug study was to assess the effect of drug on drug active metabolite (drug AM) pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. drug healthy male volunteers received 10 drug drug. After at least a week washout, they received 100 drug drug, followed by 10 drug drug 2 hr later. We used dried drug spot sampling method to monitor drug AM pharmacokinetics (C(max) , t(1/2) , t(max) , AUC(0-6 hr) ) at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4 and 6 hr after drug administration. A 'cocktail' approach was used to measure CYP2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A activities. In the presence of drug, drug AM C(max)  and AUC were decreased by 45% (mean ratio: 0.55, drug 90%: 0.40-0.7, p = 0.007) and 38% (mean ratio: 0.62, drug 90%: 0.54-0.7, p = 0.005), respectively, while t(1/2)  and t(max)  were not affected. drug metabolic ratio (MR) dramatically decreased in presence of drug (6.7 2.6 versus 0.13 0.07) reflecting an almost complete inhibition of drug, whereas drug, drug and drug MR were not affected. These data demonstrate that drug is able to block drug drug bioactivation. This CYP-mediated drug-drug interaction might lead to a significant reduction of drug efficacy in HIV-infected patients with acute coronary syndrome.","Controlled Clinical Trial ;Journal Article

44,25752914,Impact of CYP2C19 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of drug in patients with pancreatic cancer.,"This study evaluated the influence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of drug and its metabolite M8 in patients with pancreatic cancer. drug was administered orally to patients for drug 10 days. The drug concentrations of drug and M8 were measured by HPLC. The genotypes of CYP2C19*1, CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Pharmacokinetic profiles of drug and M8 were characterized by wide interindividual variability. The mean Cmax of drug in CYP2C19*1/*1 patients was 3.89_ _0.40 (n_=_3) and 5.12_ _0.41 (n_=_30)  g drug(-1) , while that of CYP2C19*1/*2 patients was 3.60 (n_=_1) and 6.14_ _0.31 (n_=_5)  g drug(-1) at the doses of 625 and 1250_mg drug twice daily, respectively.

45,20705902,The impact of drug coadministration on stereospecific drug pharmacokinetics.,"to assess the impact of drug coadministration on the stereoselective pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of drug. prospective, randomized, 2-phase crossover. the University of Michigan General Clinical Research Unit and Michigan Clinical Research Unit. twelve healthy volunteers aged 18 to 45 years, male and female, receiving drug treatment with drug or drug drug. participants received single dose drug drug (12.5 drug) with and without coadministration of immediate-release drug (10 drug orally twice daily), in random order. drug samples were collected at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours post-drug dose for determination of R and S drug drug enantiomer concentrations by high pressure drug chromatography. pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated for each enantiomer by noncompartmental methods and compared between study phases by analysis of variance (ANOVA) controlling for study phase order and subject, with Tukey's studentized range test post hoc. Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased significantly with drug coadministration, approximately 2.5-fold and 1.9-fold for the R and S enantiomers, respectively. R/S AUC ratio increased significantly, from approximately 2.3 to 3.0. Individual increases in enantiomeric AUCs with drug coadministration ranged from 0% to 571% and changes in R/S ratio ranged from -8% to 108%. Heart rate, P-R interval, and drug pressure were monitored and drug clinically significant changes in drug effects were noted. this study demonstrated a PK drug-drug interaction between drug and drug, with considerable interparticipant variability in drug PK parameters and magnitude of drug interaction. Stereoselectivity of drug metabolism is preserved with drug coadministration, and R/S AUC ratio generally widens. Although this drug interaction could potentially increase drug antagonism and have significant clinical effects in patients, these effects were not seen in our healthy volunteer participants.","Clinical Trial, Phase II ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,METHODS AND MATERIALS Study Design

46,21545485,"Effects of the moderate drug inhibitor, drug, on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy subjects.","Available data suggest that drug dosage should not exceed 4 drug once daily when taken concomitantly with potent drug inhibitors, such as drug. Currently, drug information is available on whether dose adjustment is necessary when drug is administered with a moderate drug inhibitor. This study shows that adjustment of drug dose is not warranted when co-administered with a moderate drug inhibitor. To assess the effects of drug, a moderate drug inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety/tolerability of drug. In this open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study, 28 healthy subjects (18-55 years) received single doses of drug 8 drug alone or with drug 200 drug. PK endpoints, including the area under the drug concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC(0, )), drug drug concentration (C(max) ), time to C(max) (t(max) ), and half-life (t(1/2) ), were assessed for 5-hydroxymethyl drug (5-drug), the active moiety of drug. Concomitant administration of drug with drug increased AUC(0, ) and C(max) of 5-drug by approximately 27% and 19%, respectively, with corresponding 90% confidence intervals of (18%, 36%) and (11%, 28%). There was drug apparent effect of drug on 5-drug t(max) or t(_) . drug was generally well tolerated regardless of drug co-administration, with drug reports of death, serious adverse events (AEs) or severe AEs. Following co-administration of drug with drug, 13 subjects (48%) experienced a total of 40 AEs; following administration of drug alone, six subjects (22%) experienced a total of 19 AEs. The majority of AEs were of mild intensity. There were drug clinically significant changes in laboratory or physical examination parameters. drug 8 drug single dose was well tolerated when administered alone or with drug. Based on the observed increase in 5-drug exposures being within the inherent variability of 5-drug pharmacokinetics, adjustment of drug dose is not warranted when co-administered with a moderate drug inhibitor provided they are not also inhibitors of transporters.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC3162656,Methods Study design This open label

47,23615868,Pharmacokinetics of coadministered drug extended release and drug dimesylate.,"In clinical practice, __-drug agonists have been adjunctively administered with psychostimulants for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Two studies have examined the adjunctive use of drug extended release (GXR, drug ; Shire Development LLC, Wayne, PA, USA) with psychostimulants in children and adolescents with a suboptimal response to psychostimulant treatment. However, the potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between GXR and drug dimesylate (LDX, drug ; Shire US LLC, Wayne, PA, USA) has not been thoroughly evaluated. The primary objective of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of GXR 4 drug and LDX 50 drug given as single doses alone and in drug. This was an open-label, randomized, three-period crossover, drug study. The study was conducted in a single clinical research center. Forty-two healthy adults were randomized in this study. Subjects were administered single drug doses of GXR 4 drug, LDX 50 drug, or GXR and LDX in drug. drug samples collected predose and up to 72 h postdose assessed drug, LDX, and d-drug levels. Bioequivalence was defined as the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios of the area under the drug concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0- ) and drug drug concentration (Cmax) falling within the bioequivalence reference interval (0.80-1.25). Safety measures included adverse events, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Forty subjects completed the study. Following administration of LDX alone or in drug with GXR, the statistical comparisons of the AUC0-  and Cmax of d-drug fell entirely within the reference interval. For drug, the 90% drug of the geometric mean ratio of AUC  for the two treatments was within the bioequivalence criteria, but for Cmax the upper bound of the 90% drug exceeded the standard range for bioequivalence by 7%. This relatively small change is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 42.9% of subjects; the most commonly reported TEAEs included dizziness (5.0, 7.3, and 7.3%) and headache (7.5, 4.9, and 7.3%) following administration of GXR, LDX, and GXR and LDX in drug, respectively. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurred in one subject following administration of LDX and in one subject following coadministration of GXR and LDX. In healthy adults, coadministration of GXR and LDX did not result in a clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug compared with either treatment alone. drug unique TEAEs were observed with coadministration of GXR and LDX compared with either treatment alone.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC3689918,Materials Methods This open label

48,22381043,Contribution of CYP2C19 and drug to the formation of the active drug from the prodrug drug.,"The drug activity of drug is mediated by its active metabolite, drug, which easily penetrates the drug-brain barrier and binds to the  -drug receptor as a potent agonist. drug undergoes an extensive first-pass metabolism, which has been suggested to be mediated by drug and CYP2C19; furthermore, strong inhibition of drug and CYP2C19 by drug increased exposure of drug, probably by inhibition of further metabolism. The novel CYP2C19 gene variant CYP2C19*17 causes ultrarapid drug metabolism, in contrast to the *2 and *3 variants, which result in impaired drug metabolism. Using a panel study with CYP2C19 ultrarapid and poor metabolizers, a major contribution of polymorphic CYP2C19 on drug metabolic elimination can be excluded. _The potent drug inhibitor drug alters the sequential metabolism of drug, substantially reducing the partial metabolic clearances of drug to drug and drug to drug, which increases the drug exposure twofold. The lowest clearance in overall drug elimination is the N-demethylation of drug to drug. Inhibition of this step leads to accumulation of the active drug. To investigate in vivo the effect of the CYP2C19 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of drug and the contribution of drug and CYP2C19 to the formation of drug using potent drug inhibition by drug. Fourteen healthy volunteers (seven CYP2C19 poor and seven ultrarapid metabolizers) received drug orally (300_mg twice daily) for 3 days or placebo, together with a single drug dose of drug and drug (100_mg and 4_mg, respectively). drug samples and urine were collected for 72_h. Noncompartmental analysis was performed to determine pharmacokinetic parameters of drug, drug, drug and drug. drug exposure increased sevenfold and terminal elimination half-life fivefold during drug treatment, but drug significant differences were observed between the CYP2C19 genotypes. During drug treatment, drug area under the concentration-time curve was on average doubled, with drug differences between CYP2C19 poor metabolizers [2242_h_ng_ml(-1) (95% confidence interval 1811-2674) vs. 996_h_ng_ml(-1) (95% confidence interval 872-1119)] and ultrarapid metabolizers [2074_h_ng_ml(-1) (95% confidence interval 1353-2795) vs. 1059_h_ng_ml(-1) (95% confidence interval 789-1330)]. The drug concentration-time curve of the secondary metabolite, drug, showed a threefold increase of time to reach maximal observed drug concentration; however, area under the concentration-time curve was not altered by drug. The sequential metabolism of drug is inhibited by the potent drug inhibitor, drug, independent of the CYP2C19 genotype, with a twofold increase in the exposure of the active drug.",Journal Article

49,22382316,Influence of drug P450 2C19 gene variations on pharmacokinetic parameters of drug in Japanese patients.,"drug P450 (CYP)2C19 polymorphisms may partly explain the variability of drug concentration and adverse drug effects by altering its metabolism. To compare the genetic and clinical factors responsible for the adverse effects and efficacy of drug treatment, we investigated CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms in Japanese subjects. Variations in the CYP2C19 gene in 6 patients treated with drug were analyzed. The dosage of drug, concentrations of (R)- and (S)-drug in whole drug, and clinical laboratory test results were used as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indices. Using genomic DNA, CYP2C19*2 and *3 allele frequencies were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays. The frequencies of CYP2C19 PM and hetero EM (hetEM) genotypes in Japanese patients taking drug were 2 (33.3%) and 4 (66.7%), respectively. The areas under the curve (AUC) of (R)-drug were 3.42 and 5.33 _g h/L, and those of (S)-drug were 1.64 and 2.46 _g h/L for hetEM and PM, respectively. This study provided new insights regarding the contribution of CYP2C19 gene variations to adverse responses to drug. Genotyping of CYP2C19*2 and *3 can be considerably simplified by using drug FX as a polymerase for prediction of adverse effects to drug by the PCR-RFLP method.

50,28776352,Role of the ABCB1 drug Transporter Polymorphisms in the Pharmacokinetics of drug in Humans: a Preliminary Report.,"drug is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, an efflux drug transporter encoded by ABCB1. The objective of this study was to assess the role of ABCB1 (c.1236C>T, c.2677G>T/A, and c.3435C>T) polymorphisms in the pharmacokinetics of drug and its active metabolite, drug carboxylate in humans. Nineteen healthy male subjects were enrolled, and their ABCB1 polymorphisms were evaluated. After the drug administration of 75 drug drug, the drug concentrations of drug and drug carboxylate were measured. Pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out. Systemic exposure to drug and drug carboxylate was higher in the mutant group than in the wild-type and heterozygous groups. We suggest that ABCB1 polymorphisms affect the pharmacokinetics of drug in humans.

52,21352267,Comparison of pharmacokinetic variability of drug vs. drug extended release in drug P450 2D6 extensive and poor metabolizers.,"drug and 5-hydroxymethyl drug (5-drug) are equipotent active moieties of drug; 5-drug is the singular active moiety of drug. The formation of 5-drug from drug occurs via CYP2D6, and some subjects are poor metabolizers CYP2D6. On the other hand, the formation of 5-drug from drug occurs via ubiquitous esterases. Cross-study comparisons of data from phase 1 studies suggest that active moiety exposures are considerably more variable following drug extended release vs. drug. This head-to-head study confirmed the findings of reduced pharmacokinetic variability of drug and further delineates that drug, and not 5-drug, was the principal source of variability after administration of drug extended release. The data suggest that drug delivers 5-drug consistently, regardless of CYP2D6 status, with up to 40% higher bioavailability compared with drug. drug and 5-hydroxymethyl drug (5-drug) are equipotent active moieties of drug; 5-drug is the singular active moiety of drug. Formation of 5-drug from drug and drug occurs via esterases and CYP2D6 respectively. This randomized, crossover, open-label, multiple-dose study in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) compared the pharmacokinetics of drug vs. drug extended release (ER). Subjects received drug and drug ER with a  3-day washout period. Treatment comprised 4-drug once daily doses for 5 days escalated to 8-drug once daily for 5 days. Pharmacokinetics of active moieties were compared by drug, dose and genotype. Active moiety exposures following drug and drug ER increased proportional to dose in EMs and PMs. In EMs only, coefficients of variation for AUC and C(max) following drug (up to 46% and 48% respectively) were lower than those following drug ER (up to 87% and 87% respectively). Following drug and drug ER administration, active moiety exposures ranged up to sevenfold and 40-fold respectively. Mean urinary excretion of 5-drug following drug 4 and 8 drug, respectively, was 0.44 and 0.89 drug in EMs and 0.60 and 1.32 drug in PMs. Following drug ER 4 and 8 drug, it was 0.38 and 0.71 drug respectively (EMs only). Renal clearance was similar regardless of administered drug, dose or genotype. drug, not 5-drug, was the principal source of variability after drug ER administration. drug delivers 5-drug with less variability than drug, regardless of CYP2D6 status, with up to 40% higher bioavailability. The pharmacokinetics of drug were considerably less variable than TER.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC3162652,Methods Study design This randomized

54,12132671,Optimal dose of drug for CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers in drug-Helicobacter pylori therapy: pharmacokinetic considerations.,"In drug-Helicobacter pylori therapy using drug and drug, the efficacy can be related to the CYP2C19 genotype groups; the eradication rates were 83% in extensive metabolizers and 100% in poor metabolizers. The present study was undertaken to help predict the optimal dosage of drug for extensive metabolizers in this therapy. Seven healthy Japanese subjects, classified based on the CYP2C19 genotype into extensive metabolizers (n=4) and poor metabolizers (n=3), participated in this study. Each subject received a single drug dose of drug 20, 40, and 80 drug, with at least a 1-week washout period between each dose. drug concentrations of drug and its two metabolites were monitored for 12 h after each dose of drug. After each dose was administered, the pharmacokinetic profiles of drug and its two metabolites were significantly different between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers. The area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) of drug in extensive metabolizers was disproportionally increased 3.2- or 19.2-fold with dose escalation from 20 to 40 or 80 drug drug, respectively. In contrast, the AUC of drug was proportionally increased with the higher dose in poor metabolizers. The AUC of drug after 20 drug administration to poor metabolizers was almost equal to the AUC in extensive metabolizers after 80 drug administration. In drug-H. pylori therapy, the recommended dose of drug for extensive metabolizers is suggested to be a drug of 80 drug x 2/d based on pharmacokinetic considerations.",Journal Article,None,MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals drug two metabolites 59 drug drug drug obtained July Notes Biol Pharm Bull 923 927 _ To correspondence addressed e mail okumurak kobe u ac jp  drug Society Japan Optimal Dose drug CYP2C19 Extensive Metabolizers drug Helicobacter pylori Therapy Pharmacokinetic Considerations Tomoko KITA Toshiyuki SAKAEDA Nobuo AOYAMA b Toshiyuki SAKAI c Yuko KAWAHARA Masato KASUGA c Katsuhiko OKUMURA a Department Hospital Pharmacy School Medicine Kobe University b Department Endoscopy School Medicine Kobe University c Division Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases Department Clinical Molecular Medicine Graduate School Medicine Kobe University Chuo ku Kobe 650 0017 Japan Received January accepted April In drug Helicobacter pylori therapy using drug drug efficacy related CYP2C19 genotype groups eradication rates extensive metabolizers poor metabolizers The present study undertaken help predict optimal dosage drug extensive metabolizers therapy Seven healthy Japanese subjects classified based CYP2C19 genotype extensive metabolizers n54 poor metabolizers n53 participated study Each subject received single drug dose drug drug least 1 week washout period dose drug concentrations drug two metabolites monitored h dose drug After dose administered pharmacokinetic profiles drug two metabolites significantly different extensive metabolizers poor metabolizers The area drug concentration time curve AUC drug extensive metabolizers disproportionally increased 3 2or 19 2 fold dose escalation drug drug respectively In contrast AUC drug proportionally increased higher dose poor metabolizers The AUC drug drug administration poor metabolizers almost equal AUC extensive metabolizers drug administration In drug H pylori therapy recommended dose drug extensive metabolizers suggested drug mg32 d based pharmacokinetic considerations Key words CYP2C19 genotype nonlinear kinetics drug Fig Metabolic Pathways drug The thickness arrows indicates approximate contribution CYP isoforms metabolic pathways AstraZeneca Ltd London U K All chemicals reagent grade obtained commercially Subjects Seven unrelated H pylori negative males agreed participate study The CYP2C19 genotype determined using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR RFLP 13 14 They classified two groups subjects extensive metabolizers CYP2C19 1 CYP2C19 1 remaining subjects poor metabolizers CYP2C19 2 CYP2C19 2 n51 CYP2C19 2 CYP2C19 3 n52 The demographics age weight extensive metabolizers poor metabolizers different years mean6S D kg respectively None subjects hepatic renal dysfunction taken drug including drug drug the counter drug least week study Written informed consent obtained subjects study commenced The protocol study approved advance Institutional Review Board Kobe University School Medicine Kobe Japan Study Protocol Each subject received single drug dose drug Omepral tablet AstraZeneca Ltd drug least 1 week washout period dose Each dose taken h breakfast lunch served h drug ingestion Venous drug samples collected prior h taking drug drug samples separated centrifugation 9003g min stored C analysis It confirmed alteration concentrations drug two metabolites storage Concentration Measurements drug concentrations drug two metabolites 59 drug drug drug measured described previously 11 12 Briefly drug drug phenacetin drug drug internal standard drug drug etherdichloromethane  v v added drug drug sample They extracted twice shaking min mixture centrifuged 9003g min Then drug propylene glycol added supernatant solvent evaporated nitrogen stream C The residue dissolved drug mobile phase filtered using 0 2 mm filter HPLC Sample Prep LCR4 LG Nihon Millipore Ltd Tokyo Japan Fifty microliter aliquots injected HPLC system Pharmacokinetic Analysis The drug drug concentration Cmax obtained graphically The areas drug concentration time curve AUC drug two metabolites calculated using linear trapezoidal rule h According rational pharmacokinetic notation AUC 59 drug drug drug depended drug AUC metabolite corrected dividing drug consider metabolic processes appropriately Statistical Analysis Equivalence variance tested using F test Statistical comparisons performed using unpaired t test p values less considered significant

Full PK profiles were determined for drug and its drug metabolite on days 4 and 18 and for EFV or DRV on days 14 and 18. In the EFV arm, the geometric mean area under the concentration time curve (AUC0-_) and Cmax of drug were 85.3 drug h drug and 15.6 drug/drug, respectively, when given alone, versus 76 drug h drug and 18.8 drug/drug when coadministered with EFV. The geometric mean ratio for drug with EFV versus alone was 0.89 [90% confidence interval (drug): 0.73 to 1.09] for AUC0-_ and 1.20 (90% drug: 0.79 to 1.83) for Cmax. In the DRV/r arm, AUC0-_ and Cmax were 62.8 drug h drug and 24.0 drug/drug, respectively, when drug was administered alone, versus 56.9 drug h drug and 23.2 drug/drug when coadministered with DRV/r. The geometric mean ratio for drug with DRV/r versus alone was 0.91 (90% drug: 0.78 to 1.06) for AUC0-_ and 0.93 (90% drug: 0.72 to 1.19) for Cmax. There were drug significant PK interactions between drug and EFV or DRV/r. drug significant safety issues or drug changes were noted.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal Article ;Research Support,

56,18294333,Increased drug metabolism in carriers of the CYP2C19*17 allele; a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers.,"The only existing study of CYP2C19*17-associated alterations in drug pharmacokinetics was retrospective and compared probe drug metabolic ratios. The CYP2C19*17 allele had been associated with a two- and fourfold decrease in drug and S/R-mephenytoin metabolic ratios. This study characterized the single-dose pharmacokinetics of drug, along with the 5-hydroxy and drug metabolites, in CYP2C19*17/*17 and CYP2C19*1/*1 subjects. The observed differences in drug AUC(infinity) suggest that the CYP2C19*17 allele is an important explanatory factor behind individual cases of therapeutic failure. AIMS To investigate the influence of the CYP2C19*17 allele on the pharmacokinetics of drug, a commonly used CYP2C19 probe drug, in healthy volunteers. In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study, 17 healthy White volunteers genotyped as either CYP2C19*17/*17 or CYP2C19*1/*1 received an drug dose of 40 drug of drug. drug was sampled for up to 10 h postdose, followed by quantification of drug, 5-hydroxy drug and drug drug by high-performance drug chromatography. The mean drug AUC(infinity) of 1973 h nmol l(-1) in CYP2C19*17/*17 subjects was 2.1-fold lower [95% confidence interval (drug) 1.1, 3.3] than in CYP2C19*1/*1 subjects (4151 h nmol l(-1), P = 0.04). A similar trend was observed for the drug metabolite with the CYP2C19*17/*17 group having a mean AUC(infinity) of 1083 h nmol l(-1), 3.1-fold lower (95% drug 1.2, 5.5) than the CYP2C19*1/*1 group (3343 h nmol l(-1), P = 0.03). A pronounced correlation (r(2) = 0.95, P < 0.0001) was seen in the intraindividual drug AUC(infinity) and drug drug AUC(infinity) values. The pharmacokinetics of drug and drug drug differ significantly between homozygous CYP2C19*17 and CYP2C19*1 subjects. For clinically important drug that are metabolized predominantly by CYP2C19, the CYP2C19*17 allele might be associated with subtherapeutic drug exposure.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial

57,21496064,"Effects of strong CYP2D6 and 3A4 inhibitors, drug and drug, on the pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular safety of drug.","drug metabolism involves both CYP2D6 and 3A4. However, data on potential drug-drug interactions between drug and inhibitors of CYP2D6 and 3A4 are limited and information on potential pharmacodynamic consequences of such pharmacokinetic interactions is missing. This study provides information on the drug-drug interactions of drug with strong CYP2D6 and strong drug inhibitors after single dose administration in healthy subjects. To determine the effect of the strong CYP2D6 inhibitor drug and strong drug inhibitor drug on the pharmacokinetics and safety (orthostatic challenge) of drug. Two open-label, randomized, two-way crossover studies were conducted in healthy male volunteers (extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers). Co-administration of multiple drug doses of 20 drug drug once daily with a single drug dose of the 0.4 drug drug HCl capsule increased the adjusted geometric mean (gMean) values of C(max) and AUC(0, ) of drug by factors of 1.34 (90% drug 1.21, 1.49) and 1.64 (90% drug 1.44, 1.85), respectively, and increased the terminal half-life (t(1/2) ) of drug HCl from 11.4 h to 15.3 h. Co-administration of multiple drug doses of 400 drug drug once daily with a single drug dose of the 0.4 drug drug increased the gMean values of C(max) and AUC(0, ) of drug by a factor of 2.20 (90% drug 1.96, 2.45) and 2.80 (90% drug 2.56, 3.07), respectively. The terminal half-life was slightly increased from 10.5 h to 11.8 h. These pharmacokinetic changes were not accompanied by clinically significant alterations of haemodynamic responses during orthostatic stress testing.

59,20078609,The effects of drug on drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy subjects.,"* drug-A receptor antagonists (ETRAs) and drug-type 5 inhibitors are approved monotherapies for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension; combining agents from these two drug classes could be beneficial. * There is a significant pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between the ETRA drug and the drug-type 5 inhibitor drug. * This study assessed whether the ETRA drug similarly impacts the PK of drug. * This study demonstrates that drug has little effect on drug PK and pharmacodynamics and that drug dose adjustment of either drug is required upon co-administration of drug with drug. This study evaluated the effects of drug on the pharmacodynamic [systemic drug pressure (BP)] and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of drug in healthy volunteers. Healthy subjects (18-60 years, n= 24) were randomized into two sequence groups. Group 1 received drug drug 100 drug daily (7 days), followed by placebo (7 days). Group 2 received placebo (7 days), followed by drug drug 100 drug (7 days). On day 7 of each treatment period, participants received drug 100 drug. PK parameters and BP were analysed on day 7 in each treatment period. drug exposure was slightly higher [AUC(infinity) geometric mean ratio (GMR), 128%] when co-administered with drug 100 drug vs. placebo, demonstrating a weak, but statistically significant interaction (90% confidence interval 115.5%, 141.2%). The mean drug positive (E(max)+) and drug negative (E(max)-) changes from baseline in both systolic and diastolic BP were comparable for drug and placebo (range 4.8-7.3 mmHg) with three of four geometric mean ratios falling within the equivalence window, suggesting that the drug interaction was not clinically significant.

(treatment B); and 11 days of 40 drug drug q.d. (treatment C). A single dose of 100 drug drug was co-administered on day 8 of sessions 2 and 3. Each session was separated by a 14-day wash-out. Nineteen volunteers (seven female) participated. When a single dose of drug was administered in the presence of steady-state drug, drug least squares means ratios (90% confidence interval) for AUC(last) and C(max) were 0.86 (0.76, 0.97) and 0.94 (0.75, 1.17), respectively, compared with administration of drug alone. When administered with steady-state drug, these values were 1.41 (1.22, 1.62) and 1.17 (0.96, 1.43), respectively. Co-administration of a single dose of drug and drug or drug was generally safe and well tolerated. drug slightly decreased drug exposure, whereas drug increased it by approximately 41%. The increased exposure of drug when co-administered with drug is attributed to CYP2C19 inhibition. Considering the favourable safety profile of drug, these changes are not clinically relevant. drug can be co-administered with drug pump inhibitors and H(2) antagonists without dose

61,21171670,Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic interaction between drug (drug) and drug in healthy subjects.,"Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) have been identified as a primary cause of reflux events in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). drug(B) receptor agonists such as drug (drug) have been shown to inhibit TLESRs in healthy subjects and patients with GERD, and, therefore, offer a novel therapeutic add-on strategy to drug suppression for the management of GERD. As drug is being developed as an add-on treatment for the management of patients with GERD who have a partial response to drug pump inhibitor (drug) therapy, it is important to rule out any clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between drug and PPIs. To evaluate the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics and safety of drug and vice versa. This was an open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study. The study was open to healthy adult male and female subjects. The study subjects received treatment with, in random order, drug (150_mg twice daily [dose interval 12 hours]), drug (40_mg once daily), and a drug of both, during 7-day treatment periods. The presence or absence of pharmacokinetic interactions between drug and drug was assessed by measuring the steady-state area under the drug concentration-time curves during the dosing interval (AUC(_)) and the drug observed drug concentration (C(max)) for drug and drug. Thirty male subjects (mean age 23.2 years, 97% Caucasian) were randomized to treatment and 28 subjects completed the study (one subject was lost to follow-up, and one subject discontinued due to an adverse event). The 95% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios for AUC(_) and C(max) of drug and drug administered alone and concomitantly were within the recognized boundaries of bioequivalence (0.8-1.25). drug new safety concerns were raised during this study. The number of patients with adverse events during treatment with drug alone (n_=_17) and concomitantly with drug (n_=_18) were comparable but higher than with drug alone (n_=_10). Paresthesia (episodic, mild, and transient), pharyngitis, and flatulence were the most frequently reported adverse events. There was drug observed pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug when concomitantly administered to healthy subjects, and concomitant therapy was well tolerated.

62,24100471,"Effects of drug on the activity of drug, CYP2C19 and CYP2C8 drug and BCRP and OATP1B1 transporters using probe substrates.","drug is a CCR9 chemokine receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of Crohn's disease. As a variety of concomitant drug are often required for the treatment of Crohn's disease, it is important to characterise the drug interaction profile of drug. To confirm the results of previous in vitro inhibition studies, this study assessed the in vivo effect of drug on the activity of drug P450 drug (drug, CYP2C19 and CYP2C8) and drug transport proteins (BCRP and OATP1B1) using probe substrates. This was an open-label, single-sequence, repeat-dose study conducted in 24 healthy adult subjects. On days 1-4, subjects received probe substrates (drug, drug, drug and drug; in that order), followed by administration of drug 500 drug twice daily (BID) on days 5-14. On days 11-14, in addition to drug 500 drug BID, subjects also received probe substrates as on days 1-4. drug samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of probe substrates, drug and two of its metabolites. Geometric least-squares mean ratios (90 % confidence interval) of area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity for probe administered with drug (test) compared with probe alone (reference) for drug, drug, drug and drug were 0.92 (0.85, 0.99), 1.01 (0.95, 1.07), 0.99 (0.76,1.31) and 0.98 (0.88, 1.09), respectively.

This study evaluated the inhibitory effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates of the drug P450 (CYP) drug CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and drug. Healthy adult volunteers received single-dose cocktail probe substrates [drug (100 drug), drug (20 drug), drug (30 drug), and drug (2 drug)] followed by a 6-day washout. Subjects then received a single dose of drug 50 drug followed by a single dose of cocktail probe substrates. Nineteen of twenty subjects (drug were male) completed the study. Mean age, body weight, and body mass index were 41.8 years, 73.0 kg, and 24.4 kg/m drug is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 and a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 and the most clinically important CYP enzyme, drug. drug is unlikely to significantly increase the exposures of other drug cleared by drug. These findings are clinically relevant given that Cushing's disease is a chronic condition often requiring multiple drug and that most other therapies have significant drug interaction

64,20590587,The effects of CYP2D6 and CYP3A activities on the pharmacokinetics of immediate release drug.,"There is high interindividual variability in the activity of drug-metabolizing drug catalysing the oxidation of drug [drug P450 (CYP) 2D6 and 3A], due to genetic polymorphisms and/or drug-drug interactions. The effects of CYP2D6 and/or CYP3A activity modulation on the pharmacokinetics of drug remains poorly explored. A randomized crossover double-blind placebo-controlled study was performed with 10 healthy volunteers genotyped for CYP2D6 [six extensive (EM), two deficient (PM/IM) and two ultrarapid metabolizers (UM)]. The volunteers randomly received on five different occasions: drug 0.2 drug x kg(-1) and placebo; drug and drug (CYP2D6 inhibitor); drug and drug (CYP3A inhibitor); drug and drug+drug; placebo. drug samples for drug concentrations of drug and metabolites (drug, drug and drug) were collected for 24 h after dosing. Phenotyping for CYP2D6 (with drug) and CYP3A (with drug) were assessed at each session. CYP2D6 activity was correlated with drug and drug AUCs and C(max) (-0.71 < Spearman correlation coefficient rhos < -0.92). drug C(max) was 62% and 75% lower in PM than EM and UM. drug C(max) reduction was even more pronounced (90%). In UM, drug and drug concentrations increased whereas drug exposure was halved. Blocking CYP2D6 (with drug) reduced drug and drug C(max) by 40% and 80%, and increased drug AUC(infinity) by 70%. Blocking drug (with drug) tripled drug AUC(infinity) and reduced drug and drug AUCs by 80%.

66,15520506,drug inhibits CYP2D6 activity in vivo.,"drug is a drug drug formulated as a mixture of E-(trans) and Z-(cis) stereoisomers. drug P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) catalyzes the hydroxylation of E-drug and E-N-drug stereospecically. There is evidence that drug antidepressants might inhibit CYP2D6 activity but there is drug data about the influence of drug on CYP2D6. Eleven patients diagnosed with depression according to ICD-10 criteria were included in the study. After wash-out period, before drug treatment, drug metabolic ratio (MR1) was assessed. After 2-weeks of drug treatment, MR2 was estimated. drug and its metabolites were determined in urine by gas chromatographic method of Eichelbaum et al. Based on MR1 values, 10 patients were classified as EM (extensive metabolizers) and 1 patient as PM (poor metabolizer). During the study, after drug treatment, none of patients has changed phenotype status. However, MR2 values were statistically significantly higher than MR1. These results show the inhibitory effect of drug on CYP2D6 activity and may be of clinical value, especially in polymedicated patients treated with other CYP2D6 substrates or inhibitors.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,MATERIALS METHODS The protocol study approved Ethics Committee University Medicine Wroc_aw Poland The verbal written informed consent obtained study Patients Eleven patients women men aged 45 64 years mean age years diagnosed depression according ICD 10 criteria   F32 0 n  F32 1 n  F33 1 n  F33 2 n 2   included study ICD 10 Polish translation version drug health status confirmed drug physical examination drug analysis urinalysis hepatic function test electrocardiogram Exclusion criteria treatment substrates inhibitors CYP2D6 half life longer h baseline measurement washout period study study drug kidney dysfunction hematologic disorders medical contraindication drug antidepressants Phenotyping procedure CYP2D6 activity measured twice estimation drug MR one week wash out period MR1 2 weeks fixed dose drug treatment MR2 Each patients ingested one tablet containing drug drug drug All patients treated simultaneously Urine excrected following h collected The volume urine recorded 50 drug aliquot stored  20 C analyzed drug metabolites 2and 5 dehydrosparteine determined urine gas chromatographic method Eichelbaum et al The MR calculated  dose excreted drug dose excreted 2and 5 dehydrosparteine Based MR value patients classified CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers EM MR  poor metabolizers PM MR  Precision specifity method Quantitation done use peak area ratios drug metabolites internal standard A linear relationship obtained range tested 0 05 200 g drug The precision method determination drug metabolites good coefficient variation With sample volume drug urine concentrations low g drug could detected The specificity method assessed recording mass spectra drug metabolites GC MS Varian MAT CH drug treatment The dose drug established individually according clinical status tolerability treatment The daily fixed doses drug time second phenotyping drug n  drug n  drug n  drug n  Statistical analysis Exact one sided Wilcoxon signed ranks test used probability level p  considered statistically significant The statistical analysis performed using SPSS version Windows

68,10208643,The stereoselective metabolism of drug in poor and extensive metabolizers of drug.,"The drug serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug is administered as a racemic mixture, and R- and S-drug are metabolized in the drug by N-demethylation to R- and S-drug, respectively. R- and S-drug and S-drug are equally potent drug serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but R-drug is 20-fold less potent in this regard. Racemic drug and drug are potent inhibitors of drug P450 (CYP) 2D6 in vivo and in vitro and recent studies in vivo have shown that racemic drug is metabolized by CYP2D6. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the stereoselective metabolism of drug and drug by CYP2D6 in vivo. A single drug dose of drug (60 drug) was administered to six poor and six extensive metabolizers of drug. drug samples were collected during 6 weeks for poor metabolizers and 3 weeks for extensive metabolizers. Once a week a drug test was performed. The R- and S-enantiomers of drug and drug were determined by a stereoselective gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy method. In the poor metabolizers, the drug clearance of R- and S-drug was 3.0 l/h and 17 l/h, respectively, the corresponding values in the extensive metabolizers were 36 l/h and 40 l/h, respectively. For both enantiomers, the phenotype difference was statistically significant. In poor metabolizers, the elimination half-lives were 6.9 days and 17.4 days for R- and S-drug, respectively, and in the extensive metabolizers it was 5.5 days for both enantiomers, a significant phenotypical difference only for S-drug. For drug the elimination half-lives were 9.5 and 6.1 days in poor metabolizers for the R- and S-enantiomer, respectively. The corresponding values in the extensive metabolizers were 2.6 and 1.1 days, respectively. Also for this parameter, the differences were statistically significant. This study shows that CYP2D6 catalyses the metabolism of R- and S-drug and most likely the further metabolism of S-drug but not of R-drug.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article,None,Materials methods Study population This study designed panel study including healthy volunteers All volunteers drawn database approximately individuals phenotyped drug Six poor six extensive metabolizers drug fulfilled requirements inclusion exclusion criteria included study Persons included years age passed physical examination drug clinical chemistry haematology immunology electrocardiogram Volunteers excluded history drug disease severe allergic reactions deviated ideal weight forheight abused drug donated drug drug within last months None volunteers allowed take drug except drug drug throughout entire study period allowed drink drug day drug administration The volunteers consented participate drug written verbal information The study protocol approved regional Ethics Committee Danish National Board Health Study procedure drug Fontex Eli Lilly A S Denmark administered single drug dose drug day study period As baseline reference drug sample drawn immediately volunteer took drug O h subsequently drug sampled hand days In poor metabolizers additional drug samples drawn days The volunteers confined research facility first day drug samples drawn using indwelling intravenous catheter Venflon ii 2 Ohmeda Sweden possible On occasions drug drawn venous puncture The drug samples centrifuged drug stored C analysis When volunteers finished study drug samples transferred ice analytical laboratory Lausanne Switzerland Rand S drug Rand S drug assayed gas chromatography mass spectroscopy The limit quantification drug drug enantiomers drug Stereoselective metabolism drug drug drug enantiomers drug coefficients variance range Eap et al All volunteers agreed report adverse effect taking drug These reports registered case report forms During study volunteers also carried drug tests week In short volunteer selfadministered drug drug Depasan1 Giulini Pharma Germany hand collected urine next h hon day new drug test The first test performed day drug administered drug tests thus performed days volunteers additionally days poor metabolizers Urine volume measured drug specimen stored C analysis The urine analysed gas chromatography Vinks et al  Plwrmacokinetics statistics The apparent drug clearance enantiomer drug determined use trapezoidal rule calculating area curve AUC The elimination half life enantiomers drug drug determined according equation Finally AUC ratio drug drug determined enantiomer This ratio reflects relationship nf drug f drug With respect phenotype pharmacokinetic parameter compared Rand S enantiomer Wilcoxon s matched pair sign test enantiomer result extensive poor metabolizers compared Mann Whitney U test Calculations performed SPSS Windows statistical significance level Table I Calculated pharmacokinetic data racemic drug corresponding P values intake drug racemic drug six poor PM six extensive EM metabolizers drug Cleam11ce Eli111i11atio11 1alf life days AUC1 11g 1r l Plle11otype S J111oxeti11e R j111oxeti11e S j111oxeti11e R J111oxeti11e S Jluoxeti11e R fluoxeti11e PMl PM2 PM3 PM4 PMS PM6 Median Wilcoxon Rversus S enantiomer P value EMl EM2 EM3 EM4 58 h EMS EM6 Median 40 l Wilcoxon Rversus enantiomer P valuc Mann Whitney PM versus EM P values From urine data concentrations drug 2and 5 dehydrosparteine obtained metabolic ratio drug divided dehydrosparteines calculated Extensive metabolizers defined according metabolic ratio lower poor metabolizers according metabolic ratio greater The metabolic ratios calculated urine data compared calculating confidence limits median differences Calculations performed Medstat Herlev University Hospital
69,12644842,Correlation of drug P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity using drug phenotyping and drug disposition in healthy volunteers.,"drug has previously been shown to have predominant metabolism by drug (CYP) P450 1A2. drug has been shown to provide an accurate phenotypic probe for measuring CYP1A2 activity. The purpose of this study is to determine if a significant correlation exists between drug disposition and drug metabolic ratios. Subjects were phenotyped for CYP1A2 activity with drug probe methodology. After 200-drug drug administration, drug (4 h), saliva (6 and 10 h), and urine (8 h total) were collected for high-performance drug chromatography (HPLC) analysis of drug and its metabolites.CYP1A2 activity was measured as drug (PMR(4 h)), saliva (SMR(6 h) and SMR(10 h)), and three urinary metabolic (UMR1(8 h), UMR2(8 h), and UMR3(8 h)) ratios. Each of the 14 healthy nonsmokers (13 male) received a single 10 drug drug dose after which drug was collected for HPLC determination of drug concentrations at predose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h postdose. drug pharmacokinetic parameters in this study were similar to those previously published. All drug metabolic ratios (PMR(4 h), SMR(6 h), SMR(10 h), UMR1(8 h), and UMR2(8 h)) significantly correlated with each other (p <0.001) except for UMR3(8 h), which did not correlate. A significant correlation (p <0.05) was also found between drug clearance and PMR(4 h) (r=0.701), SMR(6 h) (r=0.644), SMR(10 h) (r=0.701), UMR1(8 h) (r=0.745), and UMR2(8 h) (r=0.710). A negative correlation was observed between drug clearance and UMR3(8 h) (r=-0.029, p=NS). A significant correlation was found between drug clearance and drug drug metabolic ratios. Interpatient variability in CYP1A2 activity may explain the wide interpatient variability in drug disposition. Compounds that modulate CYP1A2 activity may be expected to alter drug pharmacokinetics accordingly.","Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,"METHODS
Subjects
The Mercer University Institutional Review Board approved this study and each participant provided written informed consent. In all, 15 healthy nonsmokers (14 male, one female) participated in this study. Subjects were included in our investigation if they met the following inclusion criteria: medically healthy volunteers, men and women over 18 years of age, women of childbearing potential on medically acceptable birth control excluding oral contraceptives, hormonal implants, or depo-injections. Subjects were also excluded if they met any of the following exclusion criteria: presence of any chronic medical condition, pregnancy and/or breastfeeding, history of alcohol, tobacco or drug abuse, use of any prescription or over-the counter medications or herbal remedies metabolized by the CYP P450 1A2 system, or an inability to comply with a diet free of caffeine, ethanol, and grapefruit juice and products 48_h before the overnight stay prior to the study day. The health status of our subjects was assessed by a thorough health and medication history, physical examination, and a complete metabolic and hematologic blood profile, prior to study protocol initiation.

Study Design
Subjects were asked to comply with a diet free of caffeine, ethanol, and grapefruit juice/products for 48_h, and come to the Center for Clinical Research (CCR) for an overnight stay of approximately 12_h prior to the initiation of the study day. The investigator confirmed compliance with the protocol-specified diet via detailed subject interviews. After eating a standardized breakfast, subjects received 200_mg of caffeine (No-Doz). Previously standardized procedures were used for obtaining plasma; saliva and urine samples were established by previous investigators (Carrillo et al, 2000; Spigset, 1999b). Each subject had two 10_ml blood samples drawn; one sample was obtained prior to caffeine administration and the second sample 4_h postcaffeine dosing. All samples were collected in EDTA vacutainer tubes and centrifuged at 3200_g for 10_min after which plasma was harvested and stored at 80C until it was analyzed for caffeine and paraxanthine.

Immediately after caffeine administration, subjects began to collect their urine and continued to do so over the next 8_h. All urine samples were measured individually for total volume and then aliqoted into smaller samples, which were subsequently acidified to a pH of 4.0 with 0.1_M hydrochloric acid before storage at 80C (preservation of caffeine metabolites). At 6 and 10_h after caffeine administration subjects were asked to chew on a piece of paraffin wax film to stimulate saliva production and a 2_ml sample of saliva was collected and stored at 80C until the time of analysis.

Each of the 14 subjects received a single 10_mg olanzapine dose. Venous blood samples were collected for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) determination of olanzapine concentrations at predose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120_h postdose. All samples were stored at _80C until assayed. One male subject withdrew from the study for personal reasons and did not participate in olanzapine dosing.

Analytic Methods
Olanzapine plasma concentrations were assayed by Bioanalytical Services (BAS; west Lafayette, IN) by a published HPLC method developed by the drug's manufacturer (Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, IN) by HPLC (Catlow et al, 1995). Plasma, urine and salivary caffeine (137X) metabolites (17X, 13X, 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil (AAMU), 1-methylxanthine (1X), 1-methyl uric acid (1U), and 1,7 dimethyl uric acid (17U) were analyzed using validated HPLC methodology (El-Yazigi et al, 1999; Fuhr and Rost, 1994). CYP1A2 activity was measured as plasma (PMR), salivary (SMR), and urinary metabolite (UMR) to caffeine metabolic ratios were validated in previous phenotypic studies (Fuhr et al, 1996; Spigset et al, 1999; Carrillo et al, 2000).

Data and Statistical Analysis
Olanzapine pharmacokinetic parameters values for each subject were determined with the use of noncompartmental methods and are displayed in Table 1. Maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were determined by visual inspection of the concentrationtime profiles. The elimination rate constant (_z) was estimated as the absolute value of the slope of a linear regression of natural logarithm of concentration vs time. Half-life was calculated as ln_2/_z. The area under the plasma concentrationtime curve (AUC0) was determined by the linear trapezoidal rule with extrapolation to infinity (AUC0) by dividing the last concentration measured by the elimination rate constant (_z). Oral clearance (CL/F) was determined by dividing the dose administered by AUC0 and the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was calculated as the ratio of CL/F to _z. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the differences in means for the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter values were transformed back to the original scale to give 95% CIs for the geometric means.

Full size table
CYP1A2 activity was determined as molar ratios (MRs) of caffeine metabolites in plasma (P) at 4_h (PMR4_h) calculated as 17X/137X, and saliva (S) at 6 and 10_h (SMR6_h and SMR10_h) calculated as 17X/137X. The urinary (U) MR at 8_h (UMR8_h) were determined in three different calculations with different metabolite concentrations: UMR18_h=17X/137X; UMR28_h=17X+17U/137X; and UMR38_h=AAMU+1X+1U/17U (Fuhr et al, 1996; Spigset et al, 1999; Carrillo et al, 2000). Olanzapine clearance data and caffeine metabolic ratios were tested for normality with ShapiroWilk tests. Olanzapine clearance covariation with CYP1A2 activity PMR4_h, SMR6_h, SMR10_h, UMR18_h, UMR28_h, and UMR38_h was tested with Pearson's correlation coefficient. Statistical significance is defined as p<0.05 and calculations were performed with Statistica 6.0."
70,17148773,CYP3A phenotyping approach to predict systemic exposure to EGFR drug kinase inhibitors.,"drug is an orally active inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drug kinase (TK) with activity in drug-small-cell lung cancer. The response to drug is variable, possibly because of interindividual variation in the activity of drug P450 3A (CYP3A), the principal enzyme that metabolizes drug. We prospectively assessed the influence of CYP3A activity on drug disposition and toxicity. Twenty-seven patients with advanced cancer were treated with daily drug drug at 250 drug (n = 13) or 500 drug (n = 14) for 28 days. Concentration-time profiles of drug and geftinib were constructed based on measurement of their concentration in serial drug samples using high-performance drug chromatography and mass spectroscopy. CYP3A activity was determined at baseline by assessment of drug apparent drug clearance. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed for a period of 28 days, and population modeling was performed using NONMEM software. A structural pharmacokinetic model was developed to describe the concentration-time profiles of unbound and total drug drug concentrations, and patient-specific covariates were added to the model to account for unexplained interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. Statistical tests were two-sided. drug pharmacokinetics exhibited wide interindividual variability (interindividual variability on total and unbound drug apparent drug clearance was 79% and 74%, respectively). drug clearance (mean = 40 L/h, range = 10-111) was highly correlated with that of total and unbound drug (R2 = .60 and R2 = .68, respectively) and with steady-state drug trough concentrations of drug (R2 = .58 and R2 = .60, respectively), and it accounted for approximately 40% of interindividual variability in drug clearance in the pharmacokinetic model. Both total and unbound drug steady-state drug trough concentrations were associated with the development of diarrhea (P<.05), but not skin rash. At a dose of 250 drug drug, 11 of 13 patients achieved steady-state drug trough concentrations above the IC50 for inhibition of mutant EGFR in vitro (0.015 microM), but only one achieved a steady-state drug trough concentration above the IC50 for inhibition of wild-type EGFR (0.1 microM). As an in vivo phenotypic probe of CYP3A, drug drug clearance may have utility for prediction of drug exposure and dose selection. A pharmacokinetic model incorporating this indicator of CYP3A activity has potential for optimization of treatment with drug and other TK inhibitors that are metabolized in a similar

71,22240839,Impact of concomitant drug administration on drug drug exposure and drug bioavailability in healthy adult subjects.,"The aim of this open-label, randomized, and 3-period crossover study was to evaluate the influences of concomitant drug administration on the drug disposition, intestinal drug, and urinary excretion of drug in humans. drug (200 drug) was orally administered alone, with 1 g drug oxide (MgO), or with 20 drug drug to 13 healthy adult subjects. drug bioavailability (BA) of drug was estimated by 24-h urine collection. The C(max), T(max) and AUC(0- ) of drug + MgO were significantly lower than that of drug alone (by 33%, 36% and 43%, respectively) and drug + drug (by 29%, 46% and 40%, respectively). In contrast, drug significant differences were observed in the drug disposition parameters of drug between the treatments with and without drug. The drug BA in the MgO treatment was significantly lower, by 32% and 39%, compared to the drug alone and with drug treatment, respectively. There was drug significant difference in the drug BA between the drug alone and with drug treatment. Concomitant MgO and drug did not affect the renal clearance of drug. In conclusion, concomitant MgO decreased the drug exposure through the reduction of intestinal drug extent and rate.

72,26773420,Cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics in children with B-cell drug-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,"Variation in cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics and metabolism has been highlighted as a factor that may impact on clinical outcome in drug tumour types. The current study in children with B-cell drug-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was designed to corroborate previous findings in a large prospective study incorporating genotype for common polymorphisms known to influence cyclophosphamide pharmacology. A total of 644 drug samples collected drug a 5 year period, from 49 B-cell NHL patients   18 years receiving cyclophosphamide (250 drug/m(2)), were used to characterise a population pharmacokinetic model. Polymorphisms in genes including CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 were analysed. A two-compartment model provided the best fit of the population analysis. The mean cyclophosphamide clearance value following dose 1 was significantly lower than following dose 5 (1.83   1.07 versus 3.68   1.43 L/h/m(2), respectively; mean   standard deviation from empirical Bayes estimates; P < 0.001). The presence of at least one CYP2B6*6 variant allele was associated with a lower cyclophosphamide clearance following both dose 1 (1.54   0.11 L/h/m(2) versus 2.20   0.31 L/h/m(2), P = 0.033) and dose 5 (3.12   0.17 L/h/m(2) versus 4.35   0.37 L/h/m(2), P = 0.0028), as compared to homozygous wild-type patients. drug pharmacokinetic parameters investigated were shown to have a significant influence on progression free survival. The results do not support previous findings of a link between cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics or metabolism and disease recurrence in childhood B-cell NHL. While CYP2B6 genotype was shown to influence pharmacokinetics, there was drug clear impact on clinical outcome.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Multicenter Study ;Research Support, Non-U.S.

73,26991517,Therapeutic protein-drug interaction assessment for daclizumab high-yield process in patients with multiple sclerosis using a cocktail approach.,"To characterize the potential effect of daclizumab high-yield process (DAC HYP), a monoclonal antibody that blocks the high-affinity interleukin-2 receptors for treatment of multiple sclerosis, on activity of drug P450 (CYP) drug. Twenty patients with multiple sclerosis received an drug cocktail of probe substrates of CYP1A2 (drug 200 drug), CYP2C9 (drug 10 drug/vitamin K 10 drug), CYP2C19 (drug 40 drug), CYP2D6 (drug 30 drug) and CYP3A (drug 5 drug) on two sequential occasions: 7 days before and 7 days after subcutaneous administration of DAC HYP 150 drug every 4 weeks for three doses. Serial pharmacokinetic drug samples up to 96 h post dose and 12-h urine samples were collected on both occasions. Area under the curve (AUC) for drug, S-drug, drug and drug, and urine drug to drug ratio were calculated. Statistical analyses were conducted on log-transformed parameters using a linear mixed-effects model. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the geometric mean ratio (probe substrate with DAC HYP/probe substrate alone) for drug AUC from 0-12 h (0.93-1.15), S-drug AUC from 0 to infinity (AUC[0-drug]) (0.95-1.06), drug AUC(0-drug) (0.88-1.13) and drug AUC(0-drug) (0.89-1.15) were within the drug-effect boundary of 0.80-1.25. The geometric mean ratio for urine drug to drug ratio was 1.01, with the 90% drug (0.76-1.34) extending slightly outside the drug-effect boundary, likely due to high variability with urine collections and CYP2D6 activity. DAC HYP treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis had drug effect on CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A activity.","Clinical Trial, Phase II ;Journal Article ;Multicenter Study",PMC4917816,Methods

74,26974526,The Effect of drug on the Pharmacokinetics of drug in Healthy Subjects.,"drug is an drug strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) licensed for use in HIV-1 infection and is an inhibitor of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2). This study assessed the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug, an OCT2 substrate. This was an open-label, parallel-group, 3-period crossover study in healthy adult subjects. Subjects were enrolled into 1 of 2 treatment cohorts (15 subjects/cohort) receiving drug 500 drug q12h for 5 days in period 1; drug 500 drug q12h plus drug 50 drug q24h (cohort 1) or 50 drug q12h (cohort 2) for 7 days in period 2; and drug 500 drug q12h for 10 days in period 3. There were drug washout periods between treatments. Effects of drug on drug transport and paracellular permeability were evaluated in vitro. Co-administration of drug 50 drug q24h increased drug area under the curve(0-_) by 79% and Cmax by 66%, whereas drug 50 drug q12h increased drug area under the curve(0-_) and Cmax by 145% and 111%, respectively. drug t(1/2) remained unchanged. Increased drug exposure during drug co-administration returned to period 1 levels after drug discontinuation in period 3. Co-administration of drug and drug was well tolerated. In vitro, drug was not a clinically relevant inhibitor of OCT1, OCT3, multidrug and drug extrusion protein 1, multidrug and drug extrusion protein 2-K, or drug membrane monoamine transporter, and it did not affect drug paracellular permeability or uptake into an intestinal cell line. drug significantly increased drug drug exposure, which can be partially explained by OCT2 inhibition. It is recommended that dose adjustments of drug be considered to maintain optimal glycemic control when patients are starting/drug drug while taking drug.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal Article

75,25913040,drug relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug in renal transplant patients: a randomized crossover study.,"drug drug (MPA) suppresses lymphocyte proliferation through inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibition. Two formulations have been approved: drug mofetil (drug) and enteric-coated drug drug (EC-MPS). drug (PAN) inhibits gastric drug secretion, which may alter MPA exposure. Data from healthy volunteers suggest a significant drug-drug interaction (DDA) between drug and MPA. In transplant patients, a decreased MPA area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) may lead to higher IMPDH activity, which may lead to higher acute rejection risk. Therefore this DDA was evaluated in renal transplant patients under maintenance drug therapy. In this single-centre, open, randomized, four-sequence, four-treatment crossover study, the influence of PAN 40_mg on MPA pharmacokinetics such as (dose-adjusted) AUC0-12_h (dAUC) was analysed in 20 renal transplant patients (>6_months post-transplantation) receiving drug (1-2_g day(-1) ) and EC-MPS in drug with ciclosporin. The major metabolite MPA glucuronide (MPAG) and the IMPDH activity were also examined. MMF_+_PAN intake led to a lowest mean dAUC for MPA of 41.46_ng h drug(-1) drug(-1) [95% confidence interval (drug) 32.38, 50.54], while MPA exposure was highest for EC-MPS_+_PAN [dAUC: 46.30_ng h drug(-1) drug(-1) (95% drug 37.11, 55.49)]. Differences in dAUC and dose-adjusted drug concentration (dCmax) were not significant. Only for drug [dAUC: 41.46_ng h drug(-1) drug(-1) (95% drug 32.38, 50.54)] and EC-MPS [dAUC: 43.39_ng h drug(-1) drug(-1) (95% drug 33.44, 53.34)] bioequivalence was established for dAUC [geometric mean ratio: 101.25% (90% drug 84.60, 121.17)]. Simultaneous EC-MPS_+_PAN intake led to an earlier time to Cmax (tmax) [median: 2.0_h (min-max: 0.5-10.0)] than EC-MPS intake alone [3_h (1.5-12.0); P = 0.037]. Tmax was not affected for drug [1.0_h (0.5-5.0)]_ _pantoprazole [1.0_h (0.5-6.0), P = 0.928). drug impact on MPAG pharmacokinetics or IMPDH activity was found. drug influences EC-MPS and drug

76,25862215,"drug Dimesylate Effects on the Pharmacokinetics of drug P450 Substrates in Healthy Adults in an Open-Label, Randomized, Crossover Study.","This open-label, randomized, two-period drug interaction study assessed drug dimesylate (LDX) effects on drug P450 (CYP) enzyme (CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A) activity. Thirty healthy volunteers were administered the Cooperstown cocktail (CYP1A2 [drug 200 drug], CYP2D6 [drug 30 drug], CYP2C19 [drug 40 drug], and CYP3A [drug 0.025 drug/kg] substrates) or Cooperstown cocktail + drug LDX 70 drug. drug samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-dose and serially for 72 h post-dose. Treatment differences in the primary endpoints, drug drug concentration (C max) and area under the drug concentration versus time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0- ), were assessed using geometric mean ratios with 90 % CIs. Geometric least squares (LS) means (without versus with LDX) for C max (drug/drug) were 5370 versus 5246 for drug, 2.43 versus 2.87 for drug, 35.23 versus 35.11 for drug, and 677.9 versus 466.9 for drug; and for AUC0-  (drug   h/drug) were 56,207 versus 56,688 for drug, 34.85 versus 37.27 for drug, 92.07 versus 93.04 for drug, and 1428 versus 1499 for drug. Geometric LS mean ratios were within the standard bioequivalence testing range, except for drug and drug C max. Parent/metabolite C max and AUC0-  ratios were similar between treatments except for drug/drug AUC0-  ratio, which was lower with LDX. drug serious or severe treatment-emergent adverse events were reported. LDX did not alter CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A activity. A small C max reduction for drug and its metabolite was observed, possibly reflecting an effect either on the activity of CYP2C19 or drug drug.",Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled

77,30212395,Effect of Hormonal Contraception on Pharmacokinetics of Vaginal drug in Healthy Women: Increased drug Diphosphate in Injectable Depot Medroxyprogesterone drug Users.,"Endogenous and exogenous drug hormones may affect mucosal pharmacokinetics (PKs) of topical antiretrovirals such as drug. We present PK data from healthy women using drug vaginal gel, at baseline (follicular and luteal phases) and after drug drug drug (OCP) or depot medroxyprogesterone drug (DMPA) use. CONRAD A10-114 was a prospective, interventional, open-label, parallel study. We enrolled 74 women and 60 completed the study (32 and 28 who selected OCPs or DMPA, respectively). Participants used 2 doses of drug gel separated by 2 hours, without intercourse, and were examined 3 or 11 hours after the last dose. We assessed pharmacokinetics in drug, cervicovaginal (CV) aspirate, and vaginal tissue. In general, there were drug significant differences in mucosal drug and drug diphosphate concentrations (P > 0.23) in the follicular and luteal phases, except for lower mean drug tissue concentrations (P < 0.01) in the follicular phase. drug concentrations significantly decreased in CV aspirate (P < 0.01) after drug use, but overall remained very high (>10 drug/drug). Mean tissue drug diphosphate increased to 6229 fmol/drug after DMPA use compared with 3693 and 1460 fmol/drug in the follicular and luteal phases, respectively (P < 0.01). The molecular conversion of drug into drug diphosphate was more effective in DMPA users (molecular ratio of 2.02 versus 0.65 luteal phase, P < 0.01). Both menstrual cycle phase and exogenous hormones affect topical drug mucosal and systemic PKs. However, high levels of drug and drug diphosphate were observed in the CV mucosa in the presence or absence of OCPs and DMPA, with tissue levels exceeding benchmarks of predicted mucosal drug-HIV efficacy (drug >1.00 drug/drug in CV aspirate and drug diphosphate >1000 fmol/drug).","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",None,METHODS Clinical

78,19129086,Influence of SLCO1B1 and CYP2C8 gene polymorphisms on drug pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.,"Polymorphisms in drug transporter genes and/or drug-metabolising enzyme genes may contribute to inter-individual variability in drug pharmacokinetics in humans. We sought to determine the joint effects of polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 drug transporter gene and the drug P450 ( CYP ) 2C8-metabolising enzyme gene on drug pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. Healthy Caucasian subjects were prospectively enrolled on the drug of SLCO1B1 521 T > C genotype. Additionally, subjects were genotyped for SLCO1B1 -11187 G > A, -10499 A > C and 388 A > G polymorphisms, and the CYP2C8*3 polymorphism. SLCO1B1 haplotypes and diplotypes were computationally assigned. drug drug concentrations were determined by high-performance drug chromatography and analysed using drug-compartmental methods. The study population consisted of 26 subjects, with a mean age of 33 +/- 9 years, and a mean weight of 66.6 +/- 11.7 kg. There were drug significant differences in drug pharmacokinetic parameters between SLCO1B1 diplotype groups. Subjects with the CYP2C8*1/*3 genotype ( n = 7), however, had significantly lower drug area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) and significantly higher drug drug clearance, compared with CYP2C8 wild-type homozygotes ( n = 19). Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that CYP2C8 genotype ( p = 0.006) and weight ( p = 0.022) were significant predictors of drug AUC (overall p = 0.002; R 2 = 41.6 per cent). We concluded that polymorphisms in the CYP2C8 drug-metabolising enzyme gene, but not the SLCO1B1 drug transporter gene, significantly influence drug disposition in humans. Future studies examining the influence of CYP2C8 genotypes and haplotypes on drug disposition and response in patients with type 2 diabetes are warranted.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research

This double-blind six-way crossover euglycemic drug clamp study was conducted in 14 healthy volunteers. Each analog was injected subcutaneously (0.15 units/kg) with or without drug. The commercial formulations had comparable drug time-exposure and time-action profiles as follows: 50% exposure at 123-131 min and 50% total drug infused at 183-186 min. With drug, the analogs had faster yet still comparable profiles: 50% exposure at 71-79 min and 50% drug infused at 127-140 min. The accelerated drug with drug led to twice the exposure in the first hour and half the exposure beyond 2 h, which resulted in 13- to 25-min faster onset and 40- to 49-min shorter mean drug of drug action. Coinjection of drug with drug-acting analogs accelerated drug exposure, producing an ultra-drug time-action profile with a faster onset and shorter drug of drug action.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC3554283,RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This double blind six way crossover study conducted healthy fasting volunteers The active comparators U drug drug drug injection Humalog Lilly drug drug injection NovoLog Novo Nordisk drug glulisine injection Apidra sanofi aventis drug drug prepared diluting U drug drug final concentration _g drug drug All study drug injected subcutaneously units kg abdomen random sequence Eight hour euglycemic drug clamps statistical analyses conducted previously described described detail Fig Mean drug action equivalent drug infusion measure mean residence time PK curves measures arithmetic mean first moment drug infusion rate GIR function time curve like mean residence time calculated area first moment curve product time GIR function time divided area GIR curve total drug infused
82,19177449,"Pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of drug mofetil in drug with standard-dose or reduced-dose drug in drug transplant recipients.","The pharmacokinetics of drug mofetil (drug) in drug transplant recipients may change because of pharmacokinetic interactions with coadministered drug or because changes in the enterohepatic anatomy may affect biotransformation of drug to drug drug (MPA) and enterohepatic recirculation of MPA through the hydrolysis of drug drug glucuronide to MPA in the gut. In the latter case, the choice of formulation (drug versus intravenous) could have important clinical implications. We randomized drug transplant patients (n = 60) to standard (10-15 drug/drug) or reduced (5-8 drug/drug) trough levels of drug plus intravenous drug followed by drug drug (1 g twice daily) with drug. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed after the last intravenous drug dose, after the first drug drug dose, and at selected times drug 52 weeks. The efficacy and safety of the 2 regimens were also assessed. Twenty-eight and 27 patients in the drug standard-dose and reduced-dose groups, respectively, were evaluated. drug significant differences between the drug standard-dose and reduced-dose groups were seen in dose-normalized MPA values of the time to the drug drug concentration (1.25 versus 1.28 hours), the drug drug concentration (15.5 +/- 7.93 versus 13.6 +/- 7.03 microg/drug), or the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC(0-12); 53.0 +/- 20.6 versus 43.8 +/- 15.5 microg h/drug) at week 26 or at any other time point. drug relationship was observed between the drug trough or AUC(0-12) and MPA AUC(0-12). Exposure to MPA after drug and intravenous administration was similar. Safety and efficacy were similar in the two treatment groups. In conclusion, exposure to MPA is not a function of exposure to drug. The similar safety and efficacy seen with drug plus standard or reduced doses of drug suggest that drug could be combined with reduced doses of drug.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial

83,23519656,Pharmacokinetics of coadministration of drug extended release and drug extended release.,"_2-drug agonists are used adjunctively to psychostimulants in treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when psychostimulants alone do not sufficiently reduce symptoms. However, data on the pharmacokinetic profiles and safety of drug treatments in ADHD are needed. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of drug extended release (GXR) and drug hydrochloride (MPH) extended release, alone and in drug. This was an open-label, randomized, three-period crossover, drug-drug interaction study. The study was conducted at a single clinical research center. Thirty-eight healthy adults were randomized in this study. Subjects were administered single drug doses of GXR (drug( ); Shire Development LLC, Wayne, PA, USA) 4 drug, MPH (drug( ); McNeil Pediatrics, Titusville, NJ, USA) 36 drug, or GXR and MPH combined. drug, drug (d-MPH), and l-drug (l-MPH) levels were measured with drug samples collected predose and up to 72 h postdose. Safety evaluations included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Thirty-five subjects completed the study. Analyses of the 90 % confidence intervals (CIs) for the geometric mean ratios of the drug drug concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC ) values for drug and d-MPH following administration of GXR or MPH alone or combined met strict bioequivalence criteria (90 % CIs within the interval of 0.80-1.25). Overall, combining GXR and MPH did not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of either drug. Sixteen subjects (42.1 %) had at least one TEAE. The most commonly reported TEAEs included headache and dizziness following GXR, MPH, and GXR and MPH combined. Two subjects had clinically significant abnormalities in ECG results following coadministration: both events were mild and resolved the same day. In this short-term, open-label study of healthy adults, coadministration of GXR and MPH did not result in significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. drug unique TEAEs were observed with coadministration of GXR and MPH compared with either treatment alone.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC3627016,Materials Methods This open label

84,26309401,Effects of drug/clavulanic drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug drug.,"drug drug (VPA) is mainly metabolized via glucuronide, which is hydrolyzed by _-glucuronidase and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. drug/clavulanic drug (AMC) administration leads to decreased levels of _-glucuronidase-producing bacteria, suggesting that these antibiotics could interrupt enterohepatic circulation and thereby alter the pharmacokinetics of VPA. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of AMC on the pharmacokinetics of VPA. This was an open-label, two-treatment, one-sequence study in 16 healthy volunteers. Two treatments were evaluated; treatment VPA, in which a single dose of VPA 500 drug was administered, and treatment AMC + VPA, in which multiple doses of AMC 500/125 drug were administered three times daily for 7 days and then a single dose of VPA was administered. drug samples were collected up to 48 hours. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods. Fifteen subjects completed the study. Systemic exposures and peak concentrations of VPA were slightly lower with treatment AMC + VPA than with treatment VPA (AUClast, 851.0 h drug/L vs 889.6 h drug/L; C max, 52.1 drug/L vs 53.0 drug/L). There were drug significant between-treatment effects on pharmacokinetics (95% confidence interval [drug]) of AUClast and C max (95.7 [85.9-106.5] and 98.3 [91.6-105.6], respectively). Multiple doses of AMC had drug significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of VPA; thus, drug dose adjustment is necessary.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC4539086,Methods Study design This open label two treatment single sequence drug interaction study This study coordinated Clinical Trial Center Samsung Medical Center Seoul Republic Korea Healthy male subjects drug years years body mass index BMI 19 27 kg m2 extremes included eligible enrollment On day subjects received single dose VPA drug Depakote Abbott Laboratories drug drug After washout 5 9 days subjects received AMC drug Augmentin GlaxoSmithKline plc three times daily days On day subjects received single dose VPA confined center morning day The highest approved dosage drug used study maximize ability detect significant pharmacokinetic interaction This AMC dose considered sufficient affecting intestinal microbiota based previous study 6 The study approved Institutional Review Board Samsung Medical Center The study conducted accordance Good Clinical Practice Declaration Helsinki The study registered cris nih go kr cris KCT0001165 Written informed consent obtained participants prior screening evaluations drug sampling Venous drug samples collected hour predose hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours study drug administration two subjects samples obtained hour hours instead hours hours respectively Samples placed heparinized tubes centrifuged 2 000_ g minutes 4 C drug samples stored _70 C bioanalysis drug analysis Assays drug VPA concentrations performed validated fluorescence polarization immunoassay COBAS INTEGRA Roche Diagnostics Mannheim Germany duly licensed laboratories Assays conducted compliance applicable standard operating procedures place time analysis Clinical Chemistry Laboratory Samsung Medical Center The assay coefficient variation lower sensitivity drug L The lower limit quantification drug L calibration ranged drug L drug L Safety analysis Safety evaluations included observations clinically significant changes physical examinations clinical laboratory tests drug chemistry hematology urinalysis vital signs systolic diastolic drug pressure pulse rate drug pressure values obtained seated position upper arm using semi automated cuff oscillometric sphygmomanometer Adverse events AEs monitored evaluated frequency severity relationship treatment recorded using MedDRA Version Maintenance Support Services Organization Chantilly VA USA Pharmacokinetic analysis The pharmacokinetic parameters VPA calculated noncompartmental analysis individual drug concentration time data using Phoenix WinNonlin software Certara St Louis MO USA The drug concentration Cmax time Cmax tmax obtained observed data The area drug concentration time curve time last quantifiable concentration AUClast partial AUC hours hours AUC4 12 estimate EHC determined using linear log trapezoidal method The elimination half life t1 2 calculated t1 2 ln 2 kel kel elimination rate constant kel calculated linear regression log linear concentration time curve Statistical methods All statistical analyses conducted using drug Enterprise Guide software drug Institute Inc Cary NC USA The Cmax AUClast estimates log transformed analyzed generalized linear model Back transformed summary statistics includes geometric least squares means geometric mean ratio GMR between treatment comparisons confidence intervals CIs The analysis tmax based untransformed data using drug parametric methods Wilcoxon signed rank test A sample size calculated sufficient power significance level assuming difference exposure VPA without AMC intrasubject coefficient variation VPA
85,8300893,A study of pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug at steady state.,"The steady-state pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug was evaluated in a parallel study with two groups of 12 male volunteers each. On days 1 to 7, group I subjects received a 1-drug drug tablet every 8 hours (q8h) (TRT 1) and group II subjects received 2 x 5-drug drug tablets q8h (TRT 2). On days 8 through 14, all subjects received a drug of 1-drug drug and 2 x 5-drug drug tablets q8h (TRT 3). drug samples, collected 0 to 8 hours after the morning dose on days 7 and 14, were analyzed for drug, drug and their metabolites, 1-PP, and drug-HO-drug, respectively. Additional samples were collected before the morning dose on days 5 and 6 of each session to monitor the attainment of steady state. Steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-8, and Cmin were calculated. The results indicated that for drug, there was a small (< 10%) increase in Cmax and AUC when coadministered with drug. For drug, there was a 10% and 29% increase in Cmax and AUC, when coadministered with drug. These values were within the drug variability observed with this class of drug. Except for a 14% decrease in Cmin for drug-HO-drug, coadministration of drug and drug did not affect the parameters for the metabolites. The results of this study suggest that coadministration of drug and drug did not markedly affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either drug.",Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article,None,MATERIAI S AND METHODS Study Design This study employed parallel group design healthy male volunteers The subjects classified two groups I II subjects subjects assigned Group I subjects assigned Group II On study days subjects Group I received 1 drug drug tablet every hours q8h TRT subjects Group II received X 5 drug drug tablets q8h TRT On days subjects received drug 1 drug drug tablet X 5 drug drug tablets q8h TRT Serial drug samples pharmacokinetic evaluation collected dosing interval hours postdose study days Additional drug samples collected morning dose study days monitor attainment steady state groups subjects Subjects A total male volunteers completed study The mean age years mean body weight kg The subjects judged healthy based physical examination clinical laboratory evaluations The subjects confined clinical facility entire drug study hours administration last dose monitor withdrawal reactions abruptly drug drug dosing drug Administration On day morning dose administered overnight fast AM Additional doses administered PM PM Each dose administered drug drug The meal times kept constant study days The subjects received light breakfast hours lunch hours dinner hours receiving morning dose Collection Processing drug Samples Serial drug samples pharmacokinetic evaluation collected study days The samples collected O pre dose hours morning dose Additional drug samples collected mornCNS AGENTS ing dose study days monitor attainment steady state subject groups All venous drug samples drug collected Becton Dickinson Vacutainers containing K3 ethylenediaminetetra drug drug drug Immediately collection sample gently inverted complete mixing drug centrifuged minutes 1000g 5 C separate drug The separated drug transferred screw capped tubes kept frozen 20 C analysis Analysis drug Samples The drug samples group I subjects analyzed drug a HO drug GC electron capture detector method modified previously published method 9 drug a HO drug triazolam internal standard extracted drug using drug isoamyl drug derivatized drug anhydride The sample injected onto gas chromatograph equipped DB wide bore column The column temperature maintained 265 C The standard curves fitted linear regression equation range drug drug Quality control samples containing drug a HO drug analyzed analytical run evaluate accuracy precision sample stability storage The drug samples group II subjects analyzed drug 1 PP using previously published GC MS method 10 The standard curves fitted linear regression equation concentration range drug drug drug drug drug 1 PP using software developed BristolMyers Squibb Co Syracuse New York 11 Quality control samples containing drug 1 PP analyzed analytical run evaluate accuracy precision sample stability storage The standard curves drug drug metabolites showed high correlation coefficients betweenand within day variability quality control values generally less These data indicated assays precise accurate Pharmacokinetic Analyses The pharmacokinetic parameters drug PP drug a HO drug calculated drug concentration time profile using noncompartmental methods 12 The highest observed drug concentration sampling prefile corresponding sampling time de1105 BUCH ET AL fined Cmax Tmax respectively The area drug concentration versus time curve AUC calculated using drug linear log trapezoidal rules Trough Cmin concentrations morning dose days session used assessing attainment steady state The drug concentra tions determined sample collected hours morning dose study days defined Cmin ss used treatment comparison Statistical Analyses Statistical comparisons pharmac okinetic parameters made within group For Group I subjects statistical analyses day data performed pharmacokinetic parameters drug a HO drug Similarly Group Il subjects parameters drug 1 PP subjected statistical analyses Attainment steady state assessed evaluation CMIN data obtained AM days session For Group I subjects attainment steady state evaluated respect drug a HO drug For Group II subjects Cmin values 1 PP used subjects drug levels less lower limit quantitation Because 1 PP longer elimination half life drug steady state respect 1 PP would also indicate drug A randomized block analysis variance model used assess attainment steady state Paired t tests used compare Cmax Cmin ss AUCo a obtained days within group subjects The paired Wilcoxon signed rank test14 used compare Tmax day day group subjects
86,21496065,Effects of drug on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in healthy volunteers.,"drug-drug interactions with drug are common with potentially harmful consequences. Preclinical in vitro studies suggest that drug or 5-hydroxymethyl drug are not likely to affect drug metabolism, but a lack of interaction has not been demonstrated in a clinical study. This study shows that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug 25 drug in healthy adults are unaffected by drug 8 drug, and that co-administration of drug 25 drug and drug 8 drug is safe and well tolerated. To confirm the lack of an interaction of drug 8 drug with drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy adults. In this open-label, two-treatment, crossover study, subjects (n= 14) aged 20-41 years with drug prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were randomized to receive a single dose of drug 25 drug alone in one period and drug 8 drug once daily on days 1-9 with a single dose of drug 25 drug co-administered on day 3 in the other period. There was a 10-day washout between treatments. Pharmacokinetic endpoints were area under the drug concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0, )), drug drug concentration (C(max)), AUC from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC(0,last)), time to C(max) (t(max) ), and half-life (t(1/2)) for S- and R-drug. Pharmacodynamic endpoints were area under the INR-time curve (AUC(INR) ), drug INR (INR(max)), area under the PT-time curve (AUC(PT)) and drug PT (PT(max)). Across all pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparisons, the point estimates of treatment ratio (drug co-administered with drug vs. drug alone) were 92-100%. The 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the adjusted geometric means were contained within (80%, 125%). There were drug clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests, vital signs or ECG recordings. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug 25 drug in healthy adults are unaffected by drug 8 drug. Concomitant administration of drug and drug was well tolerated.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC3162655,Methods Inclusion exclusion criteria

88,27096250,Pharmacokinetics of drug and its metabolite N-2-glucuronide: Influence of polymorphism of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and drug transporters.,"This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for quantitative evaluation of the influence of genetic variants in metabolic drug and transporters on drug pharmacokinetics while taking into account the influence of drug clinical, biochemical and demographic factors. We included 100 patients with epilepsy on stable dosing with drug as mono or adjunctive therapy. drug and drug N-2-glucuronide concentrations were determined in up to two drug samples per patient. Patients were genotyped for UGT1A4, UGT2B7, ABCB1 and SLC22A1. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by drug-linear mixed effects modelling. Prior knowledge from previous pharmacokinetic studies was incorporated to stabilize the modelling process. A parent-metabolite model was developed to get a more detailed view on the covariate effects on drug metabolism. With a base model drug rate (interindividual variability) was estimated at 1.96 h(-1) (72.8%), drug clearance at 2.32 l h(-1) (41.4%) and distribution volume at 77.6 l (30.2%). drug clearance was associated with genetic factors, patient's weight, renal function, smoking and co-treatment with enzyme inducing or inhibiting drug. In patients with UGT2B7-161TT genotype clearance was lower compared with GT and GG genotypes. Clearance was particularly high in patients with UGT2B7 372 GG genotype (compared with AA genotype it was 117%; 95% drug 44.8, 247% higher). Variability in drug pharmacokinetics is large and quantification of its sources may lead to more precise individual treatment.

89,21883386,"Pharmacokinetic interaction between domperidone and drug leads to QT prolongation in healthy volunteers: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study.","To assess the steady-state pharmacokinetic and QT(c) effects of domperidone and drug, given alone and together. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study was carried out. Healthy subjects (14 men, 10 women; age 18-39 years; mean weight 73.5kg, range 53.8-98.8kg; 23 Europid, 1 Afro-Caribbean) received orally, for 7 days each, placebo, domperidone 10mg, four doses daily, at 4h intervals, drug 200mg 12-hourly and domperidone and drug together. The washout period was 15 days. Pharmacokinetics and serial 12-lead ECGs were assessed on day 7, and serial ECGs on day -1 and at follow-up. Two subjects withdrew before the third treatment period, so data were available for 22-24 subjects. RESULTS drug tripled domperidone concentrations at steady-state. Domperidone, drug and their drug significantly increased QT(c) F in men. Overall adjusted mean differences from placebo were 4.20 (95% drug 0.77, 7.63), 9.24 (95% drug 5.85, 12.63) and 15.90 (95% drug 12.47, 19.33) ms, respectively. In women, QT(c) F was not significantly different from placebo on either domperidone or drug alone, or in drug.

90,9129563,Effect of drug on gastrointestinal motility in relation to CYP2D6 phenotype.,"drug is widely used as an drug and drug drug. The drug effect of drug is mediated by its metabolite drug, which is formed by the polymorphically expressed enzyme CYP2D6; therefore poor metabolizers have drug analgesia after administration of drug. Like other drug, drug causes a delay of gastric emptying and spastic constipation. It is not yet known whether the effect on gastrointestinal motility is mediated by drug or its metabolite drug. To test the hypothesis that the metabolite drug is responsible for the effects of drug on gastrointestinal motility, a randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover study was performed. The orocecal transit time was studied in five extensive and five poor metabolizers of drug with the sulfasalazine-sulfapyridine method, assuming that drug effects are observed in poor metabolizers because negligible amounts of drug are formed. drug differences of orocecal transit times were observed between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers after drug placebo administration. However, after drug drug administration orocecal transit time was significantly prolonged in extensive metabolizer but not poor metabolizer subjects. All pharmacokinetic parameters of drug showed drug differences between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers. The pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- SD) of the metabolite drug were significantly different between extensive metabolizer and poor metabolizer subjects (peak serum concentration, 13.9 +/- 10.5 versus 0.68 +/- 0.15 pmol/drug; area under the serum concentration-time curve, 27.8 +/- 16.0 versus 1.9 +/- 0.7 hr.pmol/drug; total amount of drug excreted in urine, 0.160 +/- 0.036 versus 0.015 +/- 0.007 mumol). Because the orocecal transit time prolongation after drug administration was observed only in extensive metabolizers, the effect of drug on gastrointestinal motility, like the analgesia, is mediated by its metabolite drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,METHODS Study population The study protocol approved ethics committee

When coadministered with drug, the AUC and C","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC5836847,"Study design and patients
The study was performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. This single_center study was conducted at Parexel International (Berlin, Germany) and approved by the local independent Ethics Committee (State Office of Health and Social Affairs, Berlin, Germany). All patients provided written informed consent prior to study participation.

This was an open_label, three_period, single sequence study in male patients with mild_to_moderate hypertension aged 1865 years. Patients received a single dose of sildenafil 50 mg on Day 1, sacubitril/valsartan 400 mg q.d. for 5 days on Days 3 to 7, and sacubitril/valsartan 400 mg coadministered with a single dose of sildenafil (50 mg) on Day 8 (Supplemental Figure S2). The effect of sildenafil on BP are transient and not clinically significant in both hypertensive and normotensive patients.20, 33 The BP_lowering effect of sildenafil (at 40 mg and 80 mg doses) in healthy subjects lasted 5 h postdosing.34 Therefore, a 1_day washout between periods 1 and 2 does allow for a 48_h separation between first dose of sildenafil and sacubitril/valsartan, which is adequate to avoid a carryover effect with regard to BP reduction. Steady_state levels of sacubitril/valsartan are achieved in 3 days with twice daily administration of sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg or 400 mg q.d. in healthy individuals.13, 35

Untreated patients (either newly diagnosed or with a history of hypertension but not receiving any antihypertensive treatment for 8 weeks prior to screening) with a mean SBP 140 mmHg and <170 mmHg, or pretreated patients (receiving stable treatment with not more than two antihypertensive agents for 8 weeks prior to screening) with a mean SBP 160 mmHg at screening were enrolled.

The key exclusion criteria were use of antihypertensive prescription drugs, herbal supplements, and/or over_the_counter (OTC) medications and dietary supplements (including vitamins) within 2 weeks prior to initial dosing, severe hypertension (mean supine diastolic blood pressure (sDBP) 100 mmHg and/or mean supine systolic blood pressure (sSBP) 170 mmHg), or hypotension (mean sDBP <50 mmHg and/or mean sSBP <90 mmHg) at screening or at baseline. A 14_day washout period was sufficient to eliminate the potential for additional drug interactions, other than those under investigation in this study, as it is longer than five half_lives of all antihypertensive drugs used prior to screening.

Pharmacokinetic assessments
Plasma concentrations of sildenafil and its metabolite N_desmethyl_sildenafil were measured following a single dose of sildenafil (Day 1) and coadministration of sildenafil and sacubitril/valsartan (Day 8). Plasma concentrations of sacubitril/valsartan analytes (sacubitril, sacubitrilat, and valsartan) were measured at steady state of sacubitril/valsartan (Day 7) and following coadministration of sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil (Day 8). Additional predose samples were collected during sacubitril/valsartan administration (Days 3, 4, 5, and 6). A validated liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectroscopy (LC_MS/MS) method was used for quantification of sildenafil, N_desmethyl_sildenafil, and sacubitril/valsartan analytes in plasma.1, 36 The lower limit of quantification values were 1.00 ng/mL for sildenafil, N_desmethyl_sildenafil, and sacubitril; 20.0 ng/mL for sacubitrilat; and 10.0 ng/mL for valsartan.2, 16

The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using Phoenix (Build 6.2.0.495)/WinNonlin (6.2): area under plasma concentrationtime curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUCinf) and to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast), terminal half_life (T1/2), observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) for sildenafil and N_desmethyl_sildenafil. The pharmacokinetic parameters for sacubitril/valsartan analytes (sacubitril, sacubitrilat, and valsartan) were area under plasma concentrationtime curve from time zero to the end of dosing interval _ (tau) at steady state (AUCtau,ss), observed maximum plasma concentration following drug administration at steady state (Cmax,ss), and time to reach Cmax,ss after drug administration in the dosing interval (Tmax,ss)

Pharmacodynamic and biomarker assessments
Pharmacodynamic assessments, which comprised 24_h ABPMs, including mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (aDBP), mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP), and ambulatory mean arterial pressure (aMAP) were obtained every 30 min during daytime (6 am to 10 pm) and every 2 h during night time (10 pm to 6 am) prior to any drug treatment (baseline, Day 1), following single dose of sildenafil administration (Day 1), steady state of sacubitril/valsartan (Day 7), and coadministration of sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil (Day 8). Change in night time and daytime ABPM from baseline were calculated using respective baseline night time and daytime ABPM values during the three treatment periods. BP measurements were performed on the nondominant arm using a validated portable recording device and an appropriate cuff size.

For biomarkers (cGMP and ANP) and creatinine measurements, 24_h urine samples were collected in two intervals (0 to 6 h and 6 to 24 h) prior to drug treatment (baseline, Day 1), following single dose of sildenafil treatment (Day 1), single dose and steady state sacubitril/valsartan (Days 3 and 7), and following coadministration of sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil (Day 8). cGMP and ANP were measured at SGS Cephac (Saint_Benoit, France) by radioimmunoassay using commercial kits from Amersham International (Amerhsam, UK) and Izotop (Budapest, Hungary), respectively.2 Urine creatinine was analyzed at Clinical Reference Laboratory (CRL, Cambridgeshire, UK). Urinary cGMP and ANP levels were normalized to creatinine levels, and reported as creatinine_indexed urine cGMP and creatinine_indexed urine ANP. The lower and upper limit of quantification values were 17.4 and 926.0 nmol/L, respectively, for urine cGMP, and 36.1 and 231.2 pg/mL, respectively, for urine ANP measurements.

Safety assessments
Safety assessments consisted of recording all AEs and SAEs with respect to their severity and relationship to the study drug, assessments of vital signs, physical examinations, hematology, blood chemistry, and urine laboratory assessments.

Statistical analyses
Log_transformed pharmacokinetic parameters of sildenafil, N_desmethyl_sildenafil, and sacubitril/valsartan analytes were analyzed using a fixed effects model with treatment and patient as fixed factors to study the pharmacokinetic interactions between sacubitril/valsartan analytes and sildenafil. The pharmacokinetic parameters derived following combination treatment were considered as test and those following monotherapy were considered as reference treatments for statistical evaluations. The estimated geometric mean (sacubitril/valsartan and sildenafil coadministration/single drug treatment) and corresponding 90% confidence interval (CI) of treatment difference were back_transformed to obtain the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and 90% CI.

Descriptive statistics were provided for BP measurements, including ABPM (daytime, night time, and 24_h mean), and urine biomarkers (cGMP and ANP). The 24_h ABPM data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis_of_covariance model with treatment, hours postdose, and treatment by hours postdose interaction as fixed factors, patients as random factor, and time_matched baseline as covariate. The area under the effect vs. time curve (AUC0_24h) was calculated for cGMP. Test to reference (or baseline) ratios and CIs were calculated for cGMP, ANP, and ABPM.

Summary statistics were provided for all safety assessments of AEs by treatment and visit/time. The number and percentage of subjects with AEs were categorized by body system and treatment. Deviations from normal ranges were classified as abnormalities."

93,3221745,"Comparative Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Pharmacology of
Propafenone Enantiomers after Oral Administration to Man*","The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic behavior of (R)- and (S)-propafenone was investigated in a group of seven healthy volunteers,
one of whom belonged to the phenotype of poor debrisoquine hydroxy/ators. Each volunteer received 250 mg of either enantiomer as a solution
in randomized order with a washout period of one week in between. The pharmacodynamic evaluation comprised cardiovascular parameters
(HR, PQ, QRS, QT, BP) and tolerability (self-assessment questionnaire, hematology, clinical chemistry). For pharmacokinetic purposes plasma
/el'els of the parent compounds (R, S) and their 5-hydroxylated metabolites (5-R, 5-S) were measured.
As expected, there was a small but distinct increase of PQ interval with a maximum 2 h after drug intake. No difference was observed between
both enantiomers tested. In the poor hydroxy/a/Or prolongation of PQ interval was less compared to extensive metabolizers, though plasma concentrations of the unchanged drug were considerably higher. Inspection of the individual concentration time profiles in the other subjects provided
adduional evidence that the 5-OH-metabolite also contributes to this effect. Other ECG parameters, heart rate and blood pressure remained
unaffected.
Both enantiomers were well tolerated: no drug-related side effects concerning general well-being and laboratory parameters were observed.
In contrast to pharmacodynamic effects (on ECG) a distinct enantioselectivity of metabolic and/ or distributive processes can be observed
in the group of efficient hydroxylators manifesting itself in a lower clearance for R (ratio 0.500.19, probability of error < 1%), in spite of
a higher terminal elimination rate constant (ratio 1.64 0.63, probability of error< 10%). This difference cannot be accounted for by the different
degrees of protein binding of the enantiomers (fu(R) = 0.076; fu(S) = 0.049). The experience obtained with one poor hydroxy/a/Or seems to
indicate that enantioselectivity in terms of oral clearance CI/F might be lost in this phenotype. The distinctly lower clearance values/or the poor
hydroxylaror when compared to the corresponding data for efficient hydroxylators, seem to be the reflecrion of /he lower merabolic capaciry
of this phenotype.

HCI R-PPF, 50 mg, hard gelatin snap-fit capsules, lot No. EB 6001, and S-PPF, 50 mg, hard gelatin snap-fit capsules, lot No. EB 6002 were administered. For administration the contents of 5 capsules each were dissolved in approximately 100 ml warm (""-35C) tap water and given to the subjects. The container used was rinsed with another 100 ml of tap water which was also taken by the subjects together with the empty gelatin capsules. Treatment scheme and dosage After having been randomly assigned to the 2 substance groups, the subjects received a single dose of 250 mg at two different times with a washout period of 1 week in between (Table 1). Study course The study was carried out in the clinical research facility of the Department of Human Pharmacology, Experimental-Medical Research and Development, Knoll AG, Ludwigshafen, under controlled conditions. On the specific study days the fasting subjects (i.e., 10 h without food and 1 h without liquid) appeared at 6.40 a.m. in the ward, where the cardiovascular parameters (HR, PR, QRS, Ps, Pd) and the subjective well-being were recorded. After a cannula (Brauniile, size No. 1) had been inserted in a lower arm vein and 10 ml of blood (as the blank value) had been sampled in a heparinized monovette between 7.00 and 7.30 a.m., the substance was administered with approximately 200 ml of tap water at 8.00 a.m. Further blood samples were taken under the same conditions at the time stated in Table 3. Immediately after blood sampling, plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 2300-g and stored at <-20C until analyzed. Standardized (3) blood pressure and ECG control (limb leads I-a VF) were carried out after 5 and 10 min of rest in supine position at 2 h intervals. The standard Knoll self-assessment questionnaire (KF 82) (4) was filled in both before and after substance administration. Undesired effects were entered in case record forms. Two hours post application the subjects received a standard breakfast (approximately 600 calories), 5.5 h post application a standard lunch (approximately 800 calories) and 10.5 h post application a standard dinner (approximately 800 calories). The intake of liquid was at least 1500 ml per day in order to maintain sufficient diuresis. Pharmacodynamic evaluation The data obtained are evaluated using absolute values and arithmetic means with standard deviations. The individual values are analyzed for relevant differences to the baseline value. This consideration is based on the Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of (R)- and (S)-propafenone 719 results of a reference sample with n = 18 subjects without substance administration under the usual conditions and procedures of a human pharmacological tudy (3). The d,,;, values obtained from the reference sample (a= 0.05, two-sided test) which serve as relevance measure, are as follows: heart rate: 12.7 beats/ min; PQ interval: 11. 7 ms; QRS duration: 8.1 ms; systolic blood pressure: 14.3 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure: 11.5 mmHg. Evaluation of general tolerability General tolerability was determined using the Knoll self-assessment questionnaire. This is a standard questionnaire whose objectivity, reliability and validity have been checked (4). The alterations of well-being are measured in relation to time. The assessment of general tolerability of the two propafenone enantiomers is based on subjective well-being, scrutiny of the electrocardiograms for pathological changes, the results of the hematological and biochemical parameters and of urinalyses obtained before and after the study, and on any side effects entered in the case record forms. The Knoll self-assessment questionnaire contains 40 items including 3 control items. A relevant deterioration of well-being is to be assumed if the individual score is increased by more than 3 (d,,;,). The hematological and biochemical lab parameters were determined within 2 weeks before the beginning of the study. The follow-up investigations were carried out 72 h after administration of both propafenone enantiomers. The parameters analyzed were as follows: ESR, hemoglobin, erythrocyte, leucocyte, thrombocyte counts, differential blood count, Hb, hematocrit, urinalysis (Combur 9, facultative: microscopic sediment analysis), cholesterol, creatinine, PTT, TT (thrombin time), Quick value, potassium, sodium, calcium, cholinesterase, -y-GT, SOOT and SGPT, total protein and protein electrophoresis. Analytics The determination of the propafenone enantiomers was performed in duplicates of :s; l ml of plasma by means of an analogue standardized HPLC method with fluorescence detection after fluorochromation with dansylhydrazine (5). The quantification of the 5-OH metabolites was carried out using HPLC separation on a reverse phase with subsequent electrochemical detection (6). Both methods are selective for the specific analytes; they allow their highly sensitive precise determination at concentrations above I ng/ml (propafenone) or 2 ng/ml (5-OH propafenone) with detection limits of 0.5 ng/ ml each. Pharmacokinetic evaluation The pharrnacokinetic analysis was not based on a specific model but on direct evaluation of the data, postulating only a log linear terminal phase. The parameters obtained are described in more detail in Table 2. TABLE 2. Glo ary of pharmacokinetic definitions Symbol D C, c  ., t,., 1 ... /3 AUDf ~ AUD~,,u, V,/F CI/F T.,. V,./F invasion ("
