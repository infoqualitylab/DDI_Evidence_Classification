To examine the effect of drug on drug pharmacokinetics. Open-label study in healthy drug-seronegative adults conducted at the AIDS Clinical Trials Group sites in the United States. Subjects received drug number drug daily and underwent intensive sampling for pharmacokinetics on day number. Subjects took only drug number drug twice daily on days number-number. On days number-number, subjects continued drug and reinitiated drug. drug samples were collected drug number h for the calculation of drug area under the conce+Cnumberntration-time curve for number-number h on days number and number. Data from number subjects with complete pharmacokinetic samples were available for analysis. The median within-subject percentage change in drug AUC was a decrease of number.number%. drug maximum drug concentrations were also lower when drug was administered with drug. Median values for the maximum pl+Cnumberasma concentrations were number.number and number.number unit for days number and number, respectively, and the median within-subject decrease was number.number%. Coadministration of drug and drug led to a substantial reduction in drug drug concentrations. Higher doses of drug may need to be prescribed in order to achieve optimal drug-lowering activity.","Methods
The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study Anumber was a phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, pharmacokinetic drug interaction study. The primary objectives were to examine the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug, drug, and drug and the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug. The efavirenz_statin interactions were recently published [number]. The data presented here address the effect of NFVon the pharmacokinetics of drug. At the time of this study design, drug was the most commonly prescribed PI in drug-naive patients.

Subjects
Healthy drug-seronegative volunteers were recruited. The planned sample size was number subjects. Subjects who did not complete both pharmacokinetics evaluations were replaced. Subjects were accrued to the drug arm from August through December number.

Study design
Subjects self-administered drug number drug daily in the morning for the first number days and on the fourth day drug was administered under observation. Blood samples were obtained before drug administration drug well drug number.number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, and number h after administration, for drug pharmacokinetics. On days number through number, subjects took drug number drug twice daily with meals. On days number through number, subjects continued drug and restarted drug with the morning dose of drug. On day number, drug and drug doses were administered under observation and samples were collected drug number h for drug pharmacokinetics. Fasting serum total drug, drug, and drug density lipoprotein concentrations were measured at baseline and on days number, number, and number using standard enzymatic assays. drug density lipoprotein (drug) was calculated using the Friedewald equation. Adherence to study drug was measured using drug counts and questionnaires.

The human subjects committees of each participating institution and the Division of AIDS, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, approved this study and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

drug assay
Samples for drug drug concentrations were analyzed by Advion Biosciences Inc. (Ithaca, New York, USA) drug previously published [number,number].

Statistical analyses
The primary endpoint was the drug AUC from number to number h before and after coadministration of drug. Values for AUC were estimated according to the linear trapezoidal rule [number] implemented using a macro written in drug version number.number (drug Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). There was drug extrapolation beyond the dosing interval. The maximum drug concentration (Cmax), defined drug the maximum concentration observed throughout the dosing interval, was also analyzed statistically. If both the number and number h concentrations or if both study day samples were unavailable for a given subject, pharmacokinetics parameters were not calculated. The Wilcoxon signed rank test [number], applied to within-subject differences in AUC and in Cmax values, was used to test the null hypothesis of drug difference in drug exposure before initiation of drug versus after dosing to steady state. Values of Cmax were of interest because drug drug concentrations of drug may be associated with toxicity [number]. drug exposure when taken with drug relative to when taken alone, median within-subject differences, and number% confidence intervals (CI) around geometric mean ratios are reported. The last are recommended by the US drug and drug Administration to evaluate bioequivalence and drug interactions [number].",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial,2
19033449,Enantioselectivity in the pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug in healthy volunteers.,"Hypertension and dyslipidemia are independent risk factors for cardiovascular mortality and are frequently present in the same patient. drug (FV), used to reduce drug levels, and drug (LER), used to control blood pressure, are marketed drug racemic mixtures. Therapeutic activities are number-fold higher for (+)-numberR, numberS-FV and number- to number-fold higher for S-LER compared with their respective antipodes. The present study describes the enantioselective pharmacokinetic interaction between LER and FV in healthy volunteers. A crossover randomized study was conducted in number phases on number volunteers treated with a single drug racemic dose of LER (number drug) or FV (number drug) or LER plus FV. Serial blood samples were collected from number to number hours. drug concentrations of the LER and FV enantiomers were determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using the WinNonlin software. The Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests (P < .number) were used to analyze enantiomer ratios and the pharmacokinetic drug interaction. Data are expressed drug medians. In monotherapy, the kinetic disposition of both FV and LER was enantioselective. AUC values were significantly higher for (-)-numberS,numberR-FV than for (+)-numberR,numberS-FV (number.number vs number.number drug.h/mL) and for S-LER compared with R-LER (number.number vs number.number drug.h/mL). The pharmacokinetic parameters of FV were not enantioselective when combined with LER (AUC: (-)-numberS,numberR-FV: number.number; (+)-numberR,numberS-FV: number.number drug.h/mL). There was a significant reduction in S-LER (number.number vs number.number drug.h/mL) and R-LER (number.number vs number.number drug.h/mL) AUC values when FV was coadministered. In conclusion, the interaction between FV-LER might be clinically relevant because AUC values of (+)-numberR,numberS-FV were increased when LER was coadministered, and AUC values of the number LER enantiomers were reduced when FV was coadministered.","PATIENTS AND METHODS

interface in the positive ion mode drug described
by Jabor et al.number Briefly, number _L of the internal standard
(number.number _g/mL drug) and number _L drug
hydroxide solution (number.number unit) were added to the
drug samples (number.number mL), and the LER enantiomers
were extracted with number.number mL of a mixture of hexaneisopropanol
(number:number, v/v) by shaking in a drug mixer
for number minutes. After centrifugation, the organic
phases were collected and evaporated to dryness,
and the residues were dissolved in number _L hexaneethanol

10587283,Pharmacokinetic interaction of drug and drug in schizophrenic patients.,"This study investigated to what extent drug affects the pharmacokinetics of drug (THD) in schizophrenic patients under steady-state conditions. Concentrations of THD, drug, and sulforidazine were measured in drug samples obtained from number male inpatients, aged number to number years, at three different time points: A, during habitual monotherapy with THD at number +/-number unit; B, after addition of a drug dosage of drug (number drug twice a day) for number week; and C, number weeks after drug discontinuation. After the addition of drug, THD concentrations relative to time point A significantly increased approximately threefold from number.number to number.number unit (number%) (p < number.number), drug concentrations increased from number.number to number.number unit (number%) (p < number.number), and sulforidazine levels increased from number.number to number.number unit (number%) (p < number.number). The THD-drug and THD-sulforidazine ratios remained unchanged during the study. Mean drug THD, drug, and sulforidazine levels decreased at time point C, but despite drug discontinuation for number weeks, three patients continued to exhibit elevated concentrations of THD and its metabolites. In conclusion, drug markedly interferes with the metabolism of THD, probably at the CYPnumberCnumber unit CYPnumberAnumber enzyme level. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the potential for a clinical drug interaction between both compounds, and careful monitoring of THD levels is valuable to prevent the accumulation of the drug and resulting toxicity.","Methods
Patients
drug male inpatients, six smokers and four nonsmokers, who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia participated in our study. The demographic
features of the patients are displayed in Table number. According to Spanish law for clinical trials, the patients were aware of the purpose and gave drug consent for
participation in the presence of a witness who was not involved in the study. Patients' competency had previously been assessed by two experienced
psychiatrists, one who was not involved in the investigation. Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the ""Infanta Cristina"" University Hospital
(Badajoz, Spain), and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent revisions
Exclusion criteria included patients with severe medical illness, clinically significant abnormalities in the prestudy physical examination or laboratory test
results, positive history of allergy or adverse drug reactions, and history of epilepsy or seizure. None of the patients had taken any drug drug other
than THD for at least number months before the study, and drug concomitant drug, other than the agents used in the investigation, was allowed for the drug
of the study. All subjects were nonalcohol drinkers and underwent a complete physical and psychiatric examination, electrocardiographic (ECG) analysis,
urinalysis, and clinical laboratory panels for chemistry and hematology before study admission. ECGs and all laboratory tests were repeated at all drug
concentration measurements during the study.
The Mini-Mental State Examination and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale were administered upon admission. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale
(BPRS)number and the Nordic Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU, Selection for Clinical Investigations) scale number were used to evaluate clinical status and side
effects, respectively.
All patients received monotherapy with THD (drug(R), Novartis Pharma drug, Basel, Switzerland) at bedtime (approximately number p.m.) drug the habitual treatment
for the management of schizophrenia at a mean dose of number unit (range, number-number unit). drug number unit was administered for number week. Half of the
daily dose was ingested at number a.m. and the other half at number p.m. At number a.m., blood samples were obtained for examination of drug levels of THD, drug,
and sulforidazine from each subject (N = number) at three different time points: A, during habitual THD therapy; B, after number week of concomitant administration of
THD and drug; and C, after number weeks of drug discontinuation. drug was separated after centrifugation and was stored frozen at
-number[degrees]C until assayed.
CYPnumberDnumber genotyping
Venous blood samples (number-number mL) were obtained from each subject and were stored in heparinized (drug drug number USP units) sterile glass tubes
(Vacutainer(R), Becton Dickinson Systems, Europe. B.P. drug. number-number, Meylan drug, France) and stored at -number[degrees]C until DNA isolation. Genomic DNA
was purified from peripheral leukocytes using standard protocols number and was stored in sterile plastic vials at number[degrees]C until analysis.
The CYPnumberDnumber genotyping was carried out by the combined use of mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction and restriction mapping with the drug
EcoRI and XbaI drug described elsewhere.number-number The analyses performed permitted the identification of the wild type (wt) allelic variants CYPnumberDnumber*number, two active
allelic variants (CYPnumberDnumber*number and CYPnumberDnumber*number), two defective allelic variants (CYPnumberDnumber*number and CYPnumberDnumber*number), and the occurrence of complete gene deletion
(CYPnumberDnumber*number) drug well drug gene duplications or amplifications (CYPnumberDnumber*xnumber and CYPnumberDnumber*xn). This method has a predictive capacity of approximately number% of
CYPnumberDnumber metabolism.number
drug concentration assay of THD, drug, and sulforidazine
The concentrations of THD and its major metabolites in drug, drug and sulforidazine, were measured under light-protected conditions number (in
duplicate) by a drug-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method in the following manner: To number.number mL of drug, number.number mL of number.number M drug
hydroxide, number [mu]L of diisopropylether and number [mu]L (number [mu]g/mL) of the internal standard (promethazine) were added. The extracted residue was
dissolved again in number [mu]L of mobile phase, and number [mu]L were injected into a Spherisorb silica (number-[mu]m particle size, number x number.number mm) straight-phase column
(Sugelabor drug, Madrid, Spain). The column was eluted isocratically with a mobile phase containing number.number% drug, number.number% drug, and number.number% of
drug solution (number%). The flow rate was number.number unit and compounds were monitored by ultraviolet absorbance at number nm. The retention times of the
internal standard, sulforidazine, THD, and drug were number.number, number.number, number.number, and number.number minutes, respectively. drug was not detectable within number minutes
of analysis under the chromatographic conditions described. Standard curves were made with drug-free drug spiked with THD and drug in the
range of number.number-number.number [mu]mol/L and sulforidazine in the range of number.number-number [mu]mol/L (r > number.number for all compounds). The reproducibility and accuracy of the assay were
determined by analysis of a set of quality-control samples (N = number). The within-run coefficient of variation (CV) was number.number% for THD at number.number [mu]mol/L, number.number% for
drug at number.number [mu]mol/L, and number.number% for sulforidazine at number.number [mu]mol/L. The day-to-day CV was number.number% for THD, number.number% for drug, and number.number% for
sulforidazine. The limit of determination was estimated to be number.number [mu]mol/L for THD and sulforidazine and number.number [mu]mol/L for drug.
The HPLC equipment consisted of a model numberB solvent delivery module, a model number detector, and a model number automatic injector (all from Beckman
Instruments, Inc., Madrid, Spain). A computer-assisted ""System drug"" HPLC software (version number.number) (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Madrid, Spain) was used to
operate modules and facilitate data management.
Data analysis
All results are reported drug mean +/- SD. drug concentrations of THD, drug, and sulforidazine were expressed in [mu]mol/L. Normal distribution for
variables could not be assumed (Shapiro-Wilk test). Thus, a nonparametric statistical analysis, the Friedman rank test, was used to compare drug
concentrations at the three different time points A, B, and C (repeated measures). If a significant value was obtained (p <= number.number), post hoc Tukey procedure for
multiple pairwise comparisons was also applied. The p values are all two-tailed.",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial,2
21876043,Pharmacokinetics of drug administered concomitantly with drug and population-based simulation for sequential use.,"In clinical practice, drug therapy may be switched from drug to drug; such sequential use poses the potential for drug interaction due to drug Pnumber numberCnumber (CYPnumberCnumber)-mediated inhibition of drug metabolism. This open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study investigated the effect of concomitant drug on drug pharmacokinetics in number subjects: number extensive metabolizers and number poor metabolizers of CYPnumberCnumber. The study consisted of number-day drug-only and number-day drug-plus-drug treatments, separated by a number-day washout. drug pharmacokinetics were determined by noncompartmental analyses. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed in Simcyp (Simcyp Ltd., Sheffield, United Kingdom) to predict the magnitude of drug interaction should drug therapy be switched from drug to drug, following drug simulated lag times for the switch. In CYPnumberCnumber extensive metabolizers, drug increased the maximum drug concentration and the area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) of drug by number% and number%, respectively. In poor metabolizers, however, drug pharmacokinetics were unaffected by drug. The simulations based on pharmacokinetic modeling predicted that if drug was started number, number, number, or number h after the last dose of drug, the drug AUC ratios (sequential therapy versus drug only) after the first dose would be number.number, number.number, number.number, and number.number, respectively. This suggests that the remaining systemic drug would result in a marked drug interaction with drug for _ number h. Although drug safety issues were observed during coadministration, concomitant use of drug and drug is not recommended. Frequent monitoring for drug-related adverse events is advisable if drug is used sequentially after drug.","MATERIALS AND METHODS

written informed consent prior to their participation.
The study was divided into two treatments, a number-day period of drug-only
treatment and a number-day period of drug-plus-drug combination
treatment, separated by a number-day washout phase. The order in which subjects
underwent these two treatments was assigned randomly. All treatments were
administered orally in a fasted state. drug was given drug a loading dose of
number drug orally twice daily (every number h) on day number, followed by number drug every number h
on days number and number and a single number-drug dose on day number. drug was administered
drug a single loading dose of number drug orally on day number, followed by single doses of number
drug every number h on days number to number. drug (number ml) was used for the administration of
both agents. During the combination treatment phase, drug was administered
immediately after the drug dose.
A blood sample was taken at the screening visit to determine the CYPnumberCnumber
genotype status of each subject using previously validated methods (number); the
testing was conducted by Genaissance drug, Morrisville, NC. All
adverse events and their likely relationship to treatment were recorded throughout
the study period. Physical examination, laboratory safety tests, vital signs, and
number-lead electrocardiogram measurements were used to evaluate safety.
drug pharmacokinetics. Serial drug samples for drug pharmacokinetics
were collected predosing and at number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, and
number h after dosing on day number. drug samples were assayed for drug by a
previously validated method using automated solid-phase extraction, followed by
liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric analysis (number). The lower and
upper limits of quantification were number and number,number unit respectively.
drug pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental
analyses. Maximum observed drug concentration (Cmax), time to first
occurrence of Cmax (Tmax), area under the drug concentration-time curve
between number and number h (AUCnumber), area under the drug concentration-time curve
from time zero to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUCt), and
area under the curve to infinity (AUCinf) were determined on day number of each
treatment period. Cmax and Tmax were obtained directly from recorded data, and
AUCnumber and AUCt were calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. AUCinf was
calculated using the equation AUCt   (Ct*/kel), where Ct* was the last measurable
concentration and kel was the apparent terminal-elimination-phase rate
constant. All pharmacokinetic parameter values were calculated using
WinNonlin Professional (version number.number) software (Pharsight, Sunnyvale, CA).
Statistical analyses. Pharmacokinetic parameters for drug calculated
on day number of each treatment period were used drug endpoints for the statistical
analysis. AUCinf, AUCt, AUCnumber, and Cmax were subjected to analysis of variance
appropriate for the two-period, two-treatment crossover design. Tmax was summarized
descriptively. Parameters were calculated drug mean values with number%
confidence intervals (CIs), ranges, and coefficients of variation (CVs). Each
parameter was calculated separately for subjects found to be extensive metabolizers
(EMs) or poor metabolizers (PMs) of drug and was compared
between drug alone and the drug-plus-drug combination.
All statistical analyses were performed using drug (version number.number) software (drug
Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Pharmacokinetic (Simcyp) modeling and simulations. PBPK modeling and
simulations of drug interaction were performed using Simcyp (Simcyp population-
based absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination [ADME] simulator,
version number.number; Simcyp Ltd., Sheffield, United Kingdom). A Simcyp model
for drug was developed using the physicochemical properties, in vitro
data, and clinical pharmacokinetic parameters obtained mainly from the inhouse
database (Table number). The recombinant enzyme kinetics inputs (maximum
reaction velocity [Vmax] and Michaelis-Menten constant [Km]) were means of the
values from multiple sources that included in-house data (Pfizer, data on file)
and data from published literature (number, number).
For drug, standard inputs available within Simcyp were utilized. The
inhibition constant (drug) of drug for the CYPnumberCnumber enzyme used for simulating
drug-drug interaction was number.number  M (number). The literature reports drug values for
drug-mediated CYPnumberAnumber inhibition ranging from number.number to number  M; therefore,
a mean value of number.number  M was used drug the input for Simcyp modeling (number, number, number,
number, number).
Each simulation was performed for number subjects (number trials   number subjects). The
virtual population had a body weight of number kg, with drug ranging from number to number
years, and included both sexes. The dose, dosing interval, and dosing drug of
drug and drug in the simulation were identical to those used in the
clinical study. Accordingly, drug alone was dosed every number h for number days
(first two doses of number drug and subsequent five doses of number drug each), or
drug was coadministered with drug (first drug dose of number
drug and subsequent doses of number drug each every number h). For simulating sequential
dosing, drug dosing remained the same, while drug administration
was initiated at times of number, number, and number h following the last dose of drug.",DDI Randomized clinical trials,2

A single venous number mL blood sample was drawn into drug-containing tubes, and placed
immediately on ice. Samples were centrifuged number,number _ g for number minutes; drug was
collected and stored at _number  C until further analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood
samples using the Gentra Puregene extraction kit (Qiagen, Alameda, CA, USA).
Retrospective drug dosing analysis
We retrospectively examined genotype, clinical variables, and drug dose in a separate
cohort comprised of outpatients from LHSC and Vanderbilt University Medical Center
(BioVU, Nashville, Tennessee).
BioVU
BioVU at Vanderbilt University is a large collection of DNA samples linked to a

even larger database containing a secure, de-identified copy of the entire EMR utilized by
Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Referred to drug the Synthetic Derivative (SD), this
practice-derived database incorporates clinical information from multiple sources, including
diagnostic and procedural codes, drug well drug provider progress notes, hospital admissions,

Determination of drug drug concentration
All chemical and deuterated standards were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals
(North York, Canada). drug aliquots of number _L were precipitated in number _L drug
containing internal standard dnumber-drug or dnumber-drug, and centrifuged at number,number
rpm for number minutes at number  C. The supernatant was diluted number:number in number.number% drug drug. Analytes
were separated using mobile phases number.number% drug drug in drug and number.number% drug drug in
drug, starting at a ratio of number:number, with a gradient to ratio of number:number. Concentrations of
drug and drug were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LCMS) instrumentation and transitions drug previously described number.
Determination of drug and number_-drug concentrations
Sterol concentrations were measured according to published methods for LCMS number-number.
drug, number_-drug, and number_-drug-dnumber were obtained from
Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, Alabama), and drug-dnumber was obtained from CDN
Isotopes (Pointe-Claire, Canada). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Standard curves ranging from number-number _g/mL drug were prepared in number%
fatty drug-free bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of number _L of
drug or standard curve were saponified in number mL of numberM KOH in drug for number hour at number
 C. The samples were extracted twice, in number _L of hexanes each time. After evaporation at
number  C to dryness, a mixture of the following derivatization reagents was added to each
sample: number drug number-methyl-number-nitrobenzoic anhydride, number.number drug number-dimethylaminopyridine, number drug
picolinic drug, number _L pyridine, and number _L triethylamine. Samples were incubated with the
derivatization reagents at number  C for number hour, extracted in number mL of hexanes, and evaporated at
number  C to dryness. Samples were reconstituted in number _L number.number% drug and number _L drug; number _L

and eluted with a gradient from number% to number% drug:drug (number:number). The transition used
for drug was m/z number.number to number.number. The transition used for number_-drug was m/
z number.number to number.number. Interday variability was less than number% for drug and less than number% for
number_-drug, at relevant concentrations.
Determination of total drug
Total drug was measured by the enzymatic colorimetric method, using the drug
E kit from Wako (Richmond, VA). Samples were measured in triplicate using the microplate
procedure, according to manufacturer's directions.
Genotyping
We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allelic frequency
greater than number% in genes encoding drug transporters for which drug are known substrates,
and genotyped SNPs that have been demonstrated to have a functional effect on one or more
substrates in vivo. Genotype was determined by TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) for uptake transporter polymorphisms SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberA>G (rsnumber);
SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberT>C (rsnumber); SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberG>A (rsnumber); SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberG>A
(rsnumber), and efflux transporter polymorphisms ABCBnumber c.numberC>T (rsnumber);
ABCCnumber c.numberG>A (rsnumber); and ABCGnumber c.numberC>A (rsnumber). For the drug
group, polymorphisms in the drug metabolizing drug CYPnumberAnumber (rsnumber) and
CYPnumberAnumber (rsnumber) were also assessed. Patients in the drug group were also
genotyped for CYPnumberCnumber *number (rsnumber) and CYPnumberCnumber *number (rsnumber). The SNPs assessed in
the present study are summarized in Supplementary Table number. Missing genotypes ranged from
number% to number.number%, depending on the polymorphism. We repeated genotyping of number% of the
samples; number% of replicated genotypes were concordant. Haplotypes were determined using
the haplo.stats library in R using an indirect design drug and linear regression was
conducted by comparing alternative haplotypes to the reference haplotype SLCOnumberBnumber c.
numberA-cnumberT.
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the Chi-square method of the genetics
package of R. All genotypes tested were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with the exception
of ABCBnumber c.numberC>T (p = number.number) and SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberT>C (p = number.number). Genotypes
associated with drug concentration were not differently distributed between Caucasians and
other ethnicities in our patient cohort, by Chi-square test.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software Rnumber and GraphPad Prism number
(drug Jolla, CA). Differences in drug concentration with respect to each dose group were
assessed by Tukey's multiple comparisons tests. We defined the explainable variability drug
the variability attributed to characteristics other than dose and time from last dose. We
calculated this by totaling the sum of squares for each final model and assessing the
proportion contributed by the genetic variables.
For log-transformed drug concentration, the effect sizes detectable with a power of
number.number or higher are number.number, number.number and number.number for SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberT>C, SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberA>G,
and ABCGnumber c.numberC>A, respectively. For log-transformed drug concentration, the
effect sizes detectable with a power of number.number or higher are number.number, number.number and number.number for
SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberT>C, SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberA>G, and ABCGnumber c.numberC>A, respectively.

Multiple linear regression analysis
drug concentration was log-transformed to adjust for right-skew. Only those patients with
blood sampling times after the tmax of the drug were included (number.number hours and number.number hours for
drug and drug, respectivelynumber). Different genetic models_dominant, codominant,
recessive, and additive models_were considered for each transporter
polymorphism and the model that best described the fit with log-transformed drug
concentration or drug concentration was chosen. Each polymorphism was assessed for
association with log drug concentration with a cut-off p-value of number.number for further inclusion
in the multiple linear regression model. SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberT>C and c.numberA>G, and ABCGnumber c.
numberC>A, were included in the model drug additive models. In the additive model, homozygous
wildtype genotypes were coded drug number, heterozygous genotypes were coded drug number, and
homozygous variant genotypes were coded drug number. Regression analysis was performed by a
step-wise search. All models were adjusted for the demographic and dosing variables age,
gender, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, drug dose, and hours from last dose. Of these
variables, age, dose, and time from last dose were statistically significant. Next, the number
of concomitant drug or presence of the specific drug ezetimibe, drug, and
fibrate were assessed for their contribution to the model and retained if p < number.number. number_-
drug values and transporter and drug metabolizing enzyme genotypes were
similarly introduced into the model. In the final model, only those variables with p < number.number
were retained, with the exception of the demographic and dosing variables listed above.
Dosing algorithm
Maximum doses predicted to result in drug concentrations less than the numberth percentile were
calculated based on our linear regression models. The numberth percentile was determined by
adjusting the drug or drug concentrations measured in our population to the
concentration predicted at the average time of the blood sampling across the population
(number.number hours for drug and number.number hours for drug). For covariates that were not
significant in the model, we substituted the average population value: predicted
concentration was calculated for a hypothetical Caucasian patient of our average population
height and weight (body mass index of number.number unitnumber for drug and number.number unitnumber
drug), and for drug, average number_-drug concentration (number unit).

18408565,The effect of SLCOnumberBnumber*number on the disposition of drug and drug is substrate dependent: the contribution of transporting activity changes by SLCOnumberBnumber*number.,"This study was addressed to understand the underlying mechanism of the substrate-dependent effect of genetic variation in SLCOnumberBnumber, which encodes OATPnumberBnumber (organic anion transporting polypeptide) transporter, on the disposition of two OATPnumberBnumber substrates, drug and drug, in relation to their transport activities. The uptake of drug, drug, and drug was measured in oocytes overexpressing SLCOnumberBnumber*numbera and SLCOnumberBnumber*number to compare the alterations of in-vitro transporting activity. After number-drug drug or number-drug drug was administered to number healthy volunteers with homozygous genotypes of SLCOnumberBnumber*numbera/*numbera and SLCOnumberBnumber*number/*number, the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug and drug were compared among participants with SLCOnumberBnumber*numbera/*numbera and SLCOnumberBnumber*number/*number genotypes. The uptake of drug and drug in SLCOnumberBnumber*number overexpressing oocytes was decreased compared with that in SLCOnumberBnumber*number, but drug change occurred with drug. The fold change of in-vitro intrinsic clearance (Clint) for drug in SLCOnumberBnumber*number compared with SLCOnumberBnumber*numbera was larger than that of drug (P<number.number). The clearance (Cl/F) of drug was decreased to a greater degree in participant with SLCOnumberBnumber*number/*number compared with that of drug in vivo (P<number.number), consistent with in-vitro study. drug a result, Cmax and area under the drug concentration-time curve of these nonmetabolized substrates were increased by SLCOnumberBnumber*number variant. The greater decrease in the transport activity for drug in SLCOnumberBnumber*number variant compared with SLCOnumberBnumber*numbera was, however, associated with the greater effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug compared with drug in relation to the SLCOnumberBnumber genetic polymorphism. This study suggests that substrate dependency in the consequences of the SLCOnumberBnumber*number variant could modulate the effect of SLCOnumberBnumber polymorphism on the disposition of drug and drug.","Materials and methods

In total, number unrelated Korean participants had been
genotyped for the SLCOnumberBnumber variants c.numberA>G
(AsnnumberAsp) and c.numberT>C (ValnumberAla). Of these, number
healthy male participants according to their clinical

Study design
All participants took part in the randomized two-phase
crossover study, with a number-week washout period between
each administration. Each participant received a single
drug dose of number-drug drug (drug; Sankyo, Tokyo,
Japan) or a single drug dose of number-drug drug (drug;
Choongwae Pharm Co., Seoul, Korea) with numberml of
drug after an overnight fast. drug was allowed number h after
drug administration. Blood samples were drawn immediately
before and at number.number, number.number, number, number.number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number,

were centrifuged and the separated drug samples were
stored at _ numberC until analyzed.
Determination of drug and drug
concentration
For the determination of drug after the uptake study,
oocytes were sonicated with number ml of distilled drug and
number ml internal standard (drug for the analysis of
drug and drug, drug for the analysis
of drug, number unit in drug). After sonication,
the supernatant of the mixture was evaporated and the
residue was reconstituted in number ml of mobile phase
(drug : distilled drug : drug drug=number : number : number.number,
v/v). After centrifugation (number number rpm, number min), an aliquot
(number ml) of the reconstituted sample was injected into an
drug number unit/MS system (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, California, USA) in the multiple reaction monitoring
mode (m/z number/number for drug, m/z number/number for
drug, and m/z number/number for drug). The retention
times of drug, drug, and drug
were number.number, number.number, and number.number min, respectively, with a total
analysis time of number min. A mobile phase was used at a flow
rate of number.number unit through a Luna Cnumber (number number mm, number mm;
Phenomenex, Torrance, California, USA). The lower limit
of quantification is number.number unit. The assay precision was less
than number.number% and the accuracy of this assay was within the
range of number.number_number.number%.
drug concentrations of drug and drug
were also determined using a LC/MS/MS system and a
solid-phase extraction method was applied for sample
preparation. Briefly, drug samples (number.number ml) were spiked
with an internal standard (number ml of number unit drug).
The sample mixture was loaded on to the conditioned
solid-phase extraction cartridge (Cnumber Cartridges,
Sep-Pak; drug, Milford, Massachusetts, USA) and then
washed with numberml of deionized drug. The cartridge was
then eluted with numberml of drug. The eluent was dried,
then reconstituted with number ml of mobile phase, and an
aliquot (number ml) of the supernatant was injected to the
LC/MS/MS system. Lower limit of quantification was
number unit for all analytes. The coefficient of variation of
the assay precision was less than number.number% and the accuracy
exceeded number%.
Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses

drug, drug, and drug in oocytes
expressing SLCOnumberBnumber*numbera and SLCOnumberBnumber*number, the
number Pharmacogenetics and Genomics number, Vol number drug number
OATPnumberBnumber-mediated transport rate was obtained by
subtracting the transport rate of drug-injected oocytes
from that of SLCOnumberBnumber-cRNA-injected oocytes. The
transport rate of drug, drug, and drug
was plotted against the initial concentration of these
substrates, and the resulting profile was fitted to a
Michaelis_Menten equation, to estimate kinetic parameters,
such drug Vmax and Km. The Clint for each substrate
was obtained from Vmax/Km. A weighted, nonlinear
regression analysis was performed using WinNonlin
(version number.number; Pharsight, Mountain View, California, USA).
Pharmacokinetic parameters of drug and drug
were calculated by noncompartmental analysis using
WinNonlin. The peak drug concentration (Cmax) values
and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were estimated directly
from the observed drug concentration_time profile.
The elimination rate constant (Ke) was estimated from
the least-squares regression slope of terminal drug
concentrations. The AUC was calculated according to the
linear trapezoidal rule and extrapolation to infinity by
calculating AUClast-N=Clast/Ke, where Clast was the last
drug concentration after drug administration. The drug
clearance of drug and drug (Cl/F) was
calculated drug Cl/F=dose/AUC and the volume of
distribution (Vd/F) was calculated drug Vd=F _ Dose
Ke AUC :
On the basis of present results on the pharmacokinetics
of drug and drug, a sample size of five and
six participants, respectively, in each genotype group was
desired to detect a number% larger AUC of drug and
drug in participants with SLCOnumberBnumber*number/*number genotype
than in participants with SLCOnumberBnumber*numbera/*numbera genotype
with a power of at least number% (a-level number%).
The fold changes in the kinetic parameters in in-vitro
uptake study and in-vivo pharmacokinetics study
was calculated by dividing the kinetic parameter values
in oocytes overexpressing SLCOnumberBnumber*number and human
SLCOnumberBnumber*number/*number volunteers by the mean values of the
respective parameters in SLCOnumberBnumber*numbera expressing oocytes
and human volunteers with SLCOnumberBnumber*numbera/*numbera, respectively.

Previous studies characterizing this drug interaction have focused on the effect of adding drug to stable doses of drug. The objective of this study was to assess whether simultaneous initiation of drug and drug results in early alteration of the international normalized ratio (INR) response to drug.

General
The study was conducted in accordance with principles
of good clinical practice and was approved by
the appropriate institutional review boards and regulatory
agencies. All participants provided written
informed consent before any screening activity. The
study reported here has been designed and analyzed
drug recommended in the US drug and drug
Administration guidance for industry.number
Participants
Participants were male volunteers, aged number to number
years, with a body mass index of number to number unitnumber, and
were healthy drug confirmed by medical examination,
physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, vital
signs, and electrocardiography. Exclusions could be
based on significant clinical illness, use of any
drug, or positive drug or drug abuse tests.
Participants were also to be excluded or withdrawn
if they had bradycardia (heart rate <number bpm) or
orthostatic hypotension during screening or before
each drug dosing. Participants were not
allowed to use any drug, drug, or nicotinecontaining
products for the drug of the study.
Design
In this open-label, randomized, number-period crossover
study, a single number-drug dose of sublingual drug
(drug) was administered alone (treatment A) and
on day number of a number-day course of drug drug number drug
bid, number hour after the morning dose of drug
(treatment B). Participants were randomized to
sequence A-B or sequence B-A. There was a washout
period of at least number weeks between successive treatment
periods. During the study, participants were
hospitalized for a period of number days (number nights) during
each treatment period. The participants entered the
clinic in the evening prior to placebo dosing and
remained in the clinic until number hours after drug
dosing. All other assessments were done on an outpatient
basis.
On the day before each drug dose (day _number in
treatment A, day number in treatment B), participants
received a placebo treatment identical to the drug
treatment to familiarize them with the trial procedures
and with the administration of a sublingual
formulation. drug number-drug fast-dissolving sublingual
tablets and matching placebo were supplied by
Merck Sharp & Dohme (formerly NV Organon, Oss,
the Netherlands). drug drug (drug; drug
enteric) number-drug drug tablets were provided by the
contract research organization. The number-drug dose of
drug used in this study is within the recommended
therapeutic range (number-number drug) to treat psychotic
disorders.
Dosing of placebo and drug was performed
in the clinical research facility under continuous
medical supervision. The tablet was placed under
the participant s tongue, and the participant was
instructed not to swallow or chew the tablet; participants
were not permitted to drink for number hours after
sublingual dosing. On each treatment day, participants
were instructed to fast for number hours before and number
hours after dosing. Treatment was administered while

On other study days, they returned for blood sampling
and drug dosing. Blood samples were
taken drug described below. Adverse events, vital
signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory
parameters were monitored throughout the study.
Blood Collection
Blood samples of number mL were obtained for the
measurement of drug concentrations of drug,
des-M, and N-gluc. Blood samples were taken
immediately before dosing and at the following time
points postdose: number, number, number, and number minutes and number,
number.number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, and number hours. The
samples were collected by venipuncture or indwelling
catheters into tubes containing drug drug
(eg, Venoject) tubes and subsequently processed to
drug. drug samples were frozen and stored at
_number C until analysis.
Sample Analysis
Assay method for drug and des-M in drug.
Analysis of drug and des-M was performed by
the Department of Bioanalytics of Essex Pharma
Development GmbH (Waltrop, Germany). After
solid-phase extraction, the samples were analyzed
using a liquid chromatographic (LC) assay with mass
spectrometric (MS) detection. For the LC/MS assay,
an HPnumber drug-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) system (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto,
California) with a reversed-phase Discovery Cnumber analytical
column (number _ number.number mm i.d., number _m; Supelco
through Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) was
used. The split LC eluate (number and number _L) was introduced
into an drug-number triple quadrupole MS/MS
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California;
OS: Analyst Software number.number) with an electrospray ionization
source. The positive ion mode was used for
these analyses with multiple-reaction monitoring
(MRM) transitions of m/z number.number _ number.number for drug,
m/z number.number _ number.number for des-M, m/z number.number _
number.number for [numberCnumberHnumber]-drug (internal standard), and
m/z number.number _ number.number for Org number (internal standard).
The lower limit of quantization (LLOQ) was number.number drug/
mL for drug and number.number unit for des-M; the
higher limit of quantization (HLOQ) was number unit
for drug and des-M. Calibration curves prepared
with number concentrations ranging from number.number to
number.number unit for drug and number.number to number.number unit
for des-M showed good linearity (drug, Rnumber =
number.number; des-M, Rnumber = number.number). Quality control samples
(number.number, number.number, and number.number unit for drug; number.number,
number.number, and number.number unit for des-M) were prepared to
determine assay precision and accuracy. Precision
(% coefficient of variation) and accuracy (% bias)
were within the predefined criteria of <number%.
Assay method for drug N-glucuronide. Analysis
of N-gluc was performed by QPS Groningen, the
Netherlands (formerly Xendo). After solid-phase
extraction, samples were injected into the LC system.
For LC/MS/MS, an HPLC system was used that
consisted of a Series number Peltier column oven, a
Series number degasser, and number Series number micropumps
(PerkinElmer Instruments, Munich, Germany). The
LC eluate was introduced directly into an drug-number
triple quadrupole MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems;
OS: Analyst Software number.number) with an electrospray ionization
source. The positive ion mode was used for
these analyses. The MRM transitions were m/z number.number
_ number.number for N-gluc and m/z number.number _ number.number for
[numberCnumberHnumber]-N-gluc (internal standard).
Calibration curves prepared with number concentrations
ranging from number.number to number.number unit showed good
linearity (Rnumber = number.number). Quality control samples
(number.number, number.number, and number.number unit) prepared to determine
assay precision and accuracy indicated that precision
and accuracy were within the predefined criteria
of <number%.

found in de Boer et al.number
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by subject
and treatment (ie, drug with and without
drug) from the drug concentrations of drug
and its metabolites. The Cmax and the time to its
occurrence (tmax) were calculated from the measured
drug concentration data. The AUC from the first
to last time point (AUCnumber-tlast) was calculated by
means of the linear trapezoidal rule. The terminal
elimination rate constant (_z) was defined drug __, in
which _ is the slope of the terminal log-linear phase
of the AUC, drug determined by linear regression. The
terminal elimination half-life (tnumber/number) was calculated drug
logenumber/_z. AUCnumber-  was calculated drug AUCnumber-tlast +
AUCtlast-  (the latter defined drug Ctlast/_z, in which Ctlast
was the fitted concentration at time tlast using the
regression line from which _z had been calculated).
The percentage of AUCnumber-  obtained by extrapolation
number   J Clin Pharmacol number;number:number-number
GERRITS ET AL
was calculated drug number (AUCtlast- /AUCnumber- ). The apparent
clearance (CL/f) was calculated drug dose/AUCnumber- ,
and the apparent volume of distribution (Vz) was
calculated drug CL/f/_z.
Statistical Analysis on Pharmacokinetic Data
drug interaction testing of treatment B (drug plus
drug) drug  test  versus treatment A (drug
alone) drug  reference  was performed based on Cmax,
AUCnumber-tlast, and AUCnumber-  for drug and its metabolites.
For Cmax, AUCnumber-tlast, and AUCnumber- , parametric point
estimates of the true ratio test/reference with number% and
number% parametric confidence intervals (CIs) derived
from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors
sequence, subject (sequence), period, and treatment on
the loge-transformed values were calculated; these
point estimates were obtained by the ratio of the geometric
least squares means of the test and reference
treatments. Effects were considered statistically significant
if P _ .number (number-tailed probability). An acceptance
range for drug interaction testing was number.number to number.number. drug
drug interaction effect was to be concluded if the number%
CIs of Cmax, AUCnumber-tlast, and AUCnumber-  were fully contained
within this acceptance range.
For all other PK parameters, classical hypothesis
testing was performed on the loge-transformed values
using the ANOVA drug mentioned above. For tmax,
a nonparametric analysis was used on nontransformed
values. Parametric point estimates of the true
ratio  test/reference  with their number% CIs derived
from the ANOVA on loge-transformed values were
calculated (obtained by the ratio of the geometric
least squares means of the test and reference treatments).
For tmax, the point estimate of the true difference
 test minus reference  with its nonparametric
number% confidence interval was calculated.
Safety Assessments and Analysis
Safety and tolerability were assessed by terms of
participant-reported adverse events (AEs), routine
laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and
vital signs. Adverse events were collected by spontaneous
reporting and by regular questioning of the
participants using open questions (ie,  How do you
feel? ). Vital signs, ECGs, and routine laboratory
safety were assessed at screening, at regular time
points during treatment, and at follow-up.
The safety analysis included all participants who
took _number dose of study drug and was performed
on all safety data from the in-treatment period,
defined drug the time of initial trial drug exposure
to until follow-up. All AEs were recorded using
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA,
version number) terminology. The incidence of AEs was
calculated and summarized by treatment and system
organ class. For vital signs, ECGs, and laboratory
safety parameters, summary statistics were calculated
by treatment.",DDI Randomized clinical trials,0

In addition, total drug urine concentrations were
measured. The calibration range was between number and

accuracy (inaccuracy <number%) and precision (imprecision <number%).
The numberb-hydroxycortisol/drug ratio, an established
marker of human hepatic CYPnumber numberA induction (but not a
marker for P-gp activity), was assessed in morning spot
urine samples collected within number h after the complete first
morning voids,but before drug administration at the latest
(typically number min before). Samples were taken in the
morning after subjects had received three doses of
drug during treatment B and before administration
of drug in each respective treatment period. Thus,
morning spot urine samples were collected at baseline,
day number (period number), days number and number (period number), day number (period number)
and day number (period number).
Urinary concentrations of drug and numberbhydroxycortisol
were analysed by an HPLC-MS/MS method
at SGS Cephac Europe, St Beno t, France. The calibration
curves for numberb-hydroxycortisol and drug ranged between
number_number and number_number drug ml-number, respectively. The assay had
a drug interday inaccuracy and imprecision of <number (numberbhydroxycortisol)
and number% (drug) at all spiked concentrations.
Induction of CYPnumberA by drug was assessed by
the change in the ratio of numberb-hydroxycortisol/drug after
a number day treatment of number mgrifampicin once daily and after
cessation of drug,compared with the ratio at baseline
before the administration of drug.
Safety
Safety was assessed by medical examination, pulse rate,
blood pressure, number-lead ECG, laboratory parameters, and
the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AEs). The
investigator assessed tolerability based on AEs and the
laboratory evaluation according to the categories  good ,
 satisfactory ,  not satisfactory  and  bad .
Statistical methods
Point estimators (geometric means;gMeans) of the median
intrasubject ratios of AUCnumber_  and Cmax were calculated. The
statistical model was an analysis of variance model on logtransformed
parameters, including effects for  subject  and
 treatment . However, a confidence interval for the relative
bioavailability that does not contain the value number% is
equivalent to an effect significantly different from zero.
Confidence intervals were based on the residual error from
the investigated treatment comparison. Descriptive statistics
for all other parameters were calculated.",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial,2

(AUC ) was calculated drug AUC  = AUClast + Ct/Ke,
where Ct is the last drug concentration measured,
and Ke is the elimination rate constant determined
using linear regression analysis of the logarithm_linear

Pharmacokinetic analysis
Cmax and tmax were taken directly from the original data. The terminal log-linear phase of the drug concentration-time curve was identified visually for each curve. The elimination rate constant (ke) was determined by a linear regression analysis using the last number_number points on the plot of the natural logarithm of the drug concentration-time curve. The tnumber/number was calculated from the equation tnumber/number = lnnumber/ke. AUC values were calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule for the rising phase and the log-linear trapezoidal rule for the descending phase, with extrapolation to infinity, when appropriate, by dividing the last measured concentration by ke. The renal clearance (CLrenal number_number h) of drug was calculated from CLrenal number_number h = Ae/AUC(number_number), where Ae is the amount of drug excreted into urine within number h.

Ratios for drug area under the drug concentration-time curve from time number to the time of the last quantifiable concentration were number.number, number.number, and number.number and ratios for maximum drug concentration were number.number, number.number, and number.number in Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indian subjects, respectively, compared with white subjects. Similar increases in exposure to N-desmethyl drug and drug-drug were observed. SLCOnumberBnumber genotypes did not account for the observed pharmacokinetic differences between Asians and white subjects. drug exposure to drug and its metabolites was significantly higher in Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indian subjects compared with white subjects living in the same environment.","METHODS
Human pharmacokinetic trial
Subjects. Subjects were healthy white, Chinese, Malay,
and Asian-Indian volunteers identified from their
medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram,
clinical chemical, and urinalysis findings. Race
and ethnic group were self-reported by the volunteers
for both parents and all number grandparents. For Singaporean
Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indians, the ethnic
group drug defined by National Registration Identity
Cards provided additional confirmation of ethnicity.
One hundred forty-one volunteers entered and completed
the trial; all gave informed consent. There were
number men and number women who participated in this study.
In white subjects, gender has drug significant effect on
drug pharmacokinetics; therefore drug effort was
made to drug the study with respect to gender.number

Trial design. The trial (AstraZeneca Trial numberIL/
number) was designed and monitored in accordance with
Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration
of Helsinki. The trial was carried out at number centers in
Singapore, Singapore (National University Hospital
and Changi General Hospital), after protocol approval
by their institutional review boards. Volunteers were
recruited from the Singapore metropolitan area. White
subjects were required to have resided in Singapore for
at least number months before participation in the trial. Asian
subjects were permanent residents of the region.
The trial was an open-label, parallel-group, singledose
study. Volunteers fasted for number hours before and number
hours after administration of a single drug number-drug dose
of drug on day number. They were required to refrain
from strenuous exercise, smoking, drug-containing
drinks and drug, drug, drug-containing products,
and other drug.
To reduce potential dietary influences on drug
exposure, dietary histories of the subjects were
assessed before entry into the study. Subjects on extreme
diets such drug weight reduction diets were excluded.
Subjects with diets in which the percent saturated drug
content was less than number% and daily drug intake
was less than number drug were also excluded. The intent
was to have all subjects on similar diets at the time of
dosing. Each subject recorded his or her drug intake in
a diary for number days before drug administration.
The diet diary records were analyzed with Dietplannumber
(Forestfield Software, Horsham, United Kingdom), a
validated nutrition analysis software drug. Dietary
parameters, estimated drug the mean of the number-day evaluation,
included daily caloric intake; fraction of caloric
intake drug protein, drug, and drug; and daily drug
intake.
Blood sampling. Venous blood samples (number mL) for
drug, N-desmethyl drug, and rosuvastatinlactone
assays were taken before and at number.number, number, number, number, number, number,
number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, and number hours after
drug administration. Samples were collected into
tubes containing drug-drug anticoagulant and centrifuged
within number minutes; drug was then harvested and
mixed number:number with drug drug buffer, number.number unit (drug number.number),
and stored at  number C until assay.
Determination of drug drug, N-desmethyl
drug, and drug-drug concentrations.
drug samples were analyzed for drug,
N-desmethyl drug, and drug-drug by
use of a method (HPLC with mass spectrometric detection)
developed and validated at AstraZeneca, Wilmington,
Del (data on file). A robotic liquid-handling
system was used to drug the sample preparation in
a number-well format. drug proteins were precipitated via
simple protein precipitation and filtration. Analysis of
the filtrate was accomplished by multiple-reaction
monitoring via positive electrospray ionization_tandem
mass spectrometric detection.
The lower limit of quantitation for drug was
number.number unit; the upper limit was number unit but was
extended by dilution. The lower limit of quantitation
for N-desmethyl drug and drug-drug
was number.number unit; the upper limit was number.number unit.
The accuracy and precision of the analytic method
were ensured on the basis of the results for spiked
quality control samples, which were assayed on each
day of trial analysis. For drug, accuracy averaged
number% (number.number% relative SD [RSD]) at number.number unit
number.number% (number.number% RSD) at number.number unit and number.number% (number.number%
RSD) at number unit. For N-desmethyl drug, accuracy
averaged number% (number.number% RSD) at number.number unit
number.number% (number.number% RSD) at number.number unit and number.number% (number.number%
RSD) at number unit. For drug-drug, accuracy
averaged number.number% (number.number% RSD) at number.number unit number.number%
(number.number% RSD) at number.number unit and number.number% (number.number% RSD) at
number unit.
Pharmacokinetic evaluation. The primary pharmacokinetic
parameter of this trial was the area under the
drug concentration_time curve (AUC) or, if fewer
than number subjects per ethnic group had estimable AUC
values, the AUC from time number to the time of the last
quantifiable concentration (AUCnumber-t). Other pharmacokinetic
parameters included maximum drug concentration
(Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), and terminal elimination
half-life (t_) of drug and AUCnumber-t, Cmax,
and t_ of N-desmethyl drug and rosuvastatinlactone.
The apparent terminal half-life was calculated
drug number.number/ z, where  z is the terminal elimination rate
constant calculated by log-linear regression of the terminal
portion of the drug concentration_time curve. AUCnumber-t
was determined by use of the linear trapezoidal rule, and
AUC was determined drug AUCnumber-t   Clast/ z (where Clast is
the last measurable drug concentration).
Genotyping of SLCOnumberBnumber polymorphisms
Deoxyribonucleic drug (DNA) was extracted from
blood samples by use of the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). SLCOnumberBnumber polymorphisms
Anumber G and Tnumber C were genotyped by use
of TaqMan MGB technology, marketed drug Assays-by-

After PCR, FAM, VIC, and ROX fluorescence intensities
were measured in an ABI numberHT Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). Cluster analysis
was performed manually.
Statistical methods. Differences in diet (total daily
caloric intake, daily drug intake, and total drug,
saturated drug, drug, and protein drug a percent of
total calories) were analyzed by ANOVA and results
given drug the least squares mean difference and number%
confidence interval (CI) between each Asian ethnic
group and the white group.
Summary statistics for AUCnumber-t and Cmax are presented
drug geometric means and number% CIs. Half-life
values are shown drug least square means and SEs, and
tmax values are given drug mean, median, and range.
Three primary comparisons of drug AUCnumber-t
were made drug follows: Chinese versus white subjects,
Asian-Indian versus white subjects, and Malay versus
white subjects. A sample comprising number volunteers per
ethnic group had greater than number% power to ensure that
the number% CI for the ratio of AUCnumber-t for each of the number
comparisons would be contained within the interval number.number
to number.number, with the assumption that the true underlying
ratio was number. drug adjustment for multiple comparisons
was made.
drug AUCnumber-t was log-transformed before
analysis. ANOVA was used to determine geometric
mean ratios and number% CIs for each Asian group versus
the white group. drug Cmax and AUCnumber-t and
Cmax for N-desmethyl drug and rosuvastatinlactone
were analyzed in a similar manner. drug
and metabolite half-lives (untransformed) were analyzed
by ANOVA, and results are given drug the least
squares mean difference and number% CI between each
Asian ethnic group and the white group.
In contrast to the pharmacokinetic analyses, all pharmacogenetic
analyses were post hoc and hence exploratory.
Chi-square analysis was used to test for Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each SNP within
each population. SLCOnumberBnumber haplotypes were assigned
by use of an expectation maximization method drug implemented
in the software package SNPHAP.number The
pharmacokinetic measurements AUCnumber-t and Cmax of
drug were log-transformed before analysis, and
summary statistics reported are the geometric means
and number% CIs. The effects of the Tnumber C and Anumber G
SNPs and of SLCOnumberBnumber diplotypes on log-transformed
Cmax and AUCnumber-t were examined by ANOVA. Tukey-

18307374,"Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug--an drug, direct drug Xa inhibitor--in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.","There is a clinical need for novel drug drug with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. drug is an drug direct drug Xa (FXa) inhibitor in clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. This analysis was performed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in patients participating in two phase II, double-blind, randomized, active-comparator-controlled studies of twice-daily drug for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total hip- or knee-replacement surgery. Sparse blood samples were taken from all patients participating in the studies (n = number). In addition, a subset of patients in the hip study (n = number) underwent full profiling. drug drug concentrations, FXa activity and the prothrombin time were determined. Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling was used to model the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug. An drug one-compartment model described the population pharmacokinetics of drug well. On the first postoperative day only, categorization of patients drug slow or fast absorbers drug a tool to address variability in absorption improved the fit of the model. Clearance of drug was lower and more variable on the first postoperative day, and so time was factored into the model. Overall, the only major difference between the models for the hip study and the knee study was that clearance was number% lower in the knee study, resulting in approximately number% higher exposure. Residual variability in the models was moderate (number% and number% in the hip and knee studies, respectively). drug concentrations of drug increased dose dependently. Pharmacokinetic parameters that were estimated using the models agreed closely with results from full-profile patients in the hip study, demonstrating that drug pharmacokinetics are predictable. The pharmacokinetics of drug were affected by expected covariates: age affected clearance in the hip study only, haematocrit (on the first postoperative day only) and gender affected clearance in the knee study only, and renal function affected clearance in both studies. Bodyweight affected the volume of distribution in both studies. However, the effects of covariates on the pharmacokinetics of drug were generally small, and predictions of 'extreme' case scenarios suggested that fixed dosing of drug was likely to be possible. FXa activity and the prothrombin time were both affected by surgery, probably because of perioperative bleeding and intravenous administration of fluids; therefore, time was included in the pharmacodynamic models. In both studies, FXa activity correlated with drug drug concentrations following a maximum effect model, whereas prothrombin time prolongation correlated following a linear model with intercept. The slope of the prothrombin time prolongation correlation was number.number seconds/(number unit) in the hip study and number.number seconds/(number unit) in the knee study. Both pharmacodynamic models in both studies demonstrated drug residual variability of approximately number%. This population analysis in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery demonstrated that drug has predictable, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics that were well described by an drug one-compartment model and affected by expected covariates. drug exposure could be assessed using the prothrombin time, if necessary, but not the international normalized ratio. The findings suggested that fixed dosing of drug may be possible in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.","Methods

Two phase II studies, ODIXa-DVT and EINSTEIN DVT, assessed the efficacy and safety of drug drug (once daily or twice daily) for treatment of acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of drug in patients in these two phase II studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of drug and the relationship between important patient covariates and model parameters. Exposure simulations in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were also performed in order to predict the exposure of drug, using modified demographic data reflecting the characteristics of a typical AF population. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using drug samples from these patients. drug simulations were conducted to explore the pharmacokinetics of drug in patients with DVT and to predict exposure in those with AF. Correlations between drug drug concentrations and the prothrombin time, drug Xa activity, HepTest  and activated partial thromboplastin time were also described. The pharmacokinetics of drug in patients with DVT were found to be consistent and predictable across all doses studied. The area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) increased dose dependently. The same total daily doses given once daily achieved higher maximum drug concentration (C(max)) values (_number%) and lower trough (minimum) drug concentration (C(trough)) values (_number%) than when given twice daily; however, the numberth-numberth percentile ranges for these parameters overlapped. drug clearance was moderately influenced by age and renal function, and the volume of distribution was influenced by age, body weight and sex; the effects were within the observed interindividual variability. Simulations in virtual patient populations with AF showed that a drug dose of number_mg once daily in patients with drug clearance of number-number_mL/min would achieve AUC and C(max) values similar to those observed with number_mg once daily in patients with normal renal function. The prothrombin time correlated almost linearly with drug drug concentrations (_number__g/L). Population analyses of phase II clinical data indicated that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of all drug doses were predictable and were affected by expected demographic factors in patients with acute DVT.","Methods

Population Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic
Modelling
Because of the lack of rich pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
data, a population-modelling approach, based on the data from
the sparse sampling, was used. This analysis provides estimates
of population mean values and descriptions of the variability
inherent in a population. In addition, sources of variability, such
drug patient covariates, can be assessed, and post hoc empirical
Bayes estimates allow for prediction of individual patient
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters. All modelling
was based on previously developed models derived from the population
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses in healthy
subjects[number] and the ones used to determine the population
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in patients undergoing
total hip replacement.[number,number]
Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses
were performed using non-linear mixed-effects modelling
software (NONMEM  Version V Level number.number; GloboMax LLC,
Hanover, MD, USA) operated in a validated Linux server farm
environment. The first-order conditional estimation with
interaction method was used for all analyses. All statistics and
graphs were generated using S-Plus Version number software (Insightful
Corp., Seattle, WA, USA) or drug Version number.number software
(drug Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

19701114,Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug and drug in patients with schizophrenia.,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug and drug were studied in number inpatients with schizophrenia being treated with drug. The daily dose of drug was number drug in number cases and number drug in number cases. drug number unit was coadministered for number week, and blood samples were taken twice before the start of drug coadministration and then number week after completion. In addition, on these days, the severity of illness and side effects were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Udvalg for Kliniske Unders gelser side effects rating scale, respectively. drug concentrations of drug and drug were measured using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. drug significantly decreased both drug concentrations of drug and drug by number% and number%, respectively (P < number.number). Despite these decreases in drug concentrations, the total and negative scores in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, together with the neurological score in Udvalg for Kliniske Unders gelser, decreased slightly but significantly (P < number.number) after drug coadministration. The present study implies that drug augmentation may be effective for patients with schizophrenia treated with drug, although drug dramatically decreases drug concentrations of drug and drug, by inducing the metabolism of these compounds.","MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The subjects were number Japanese inpatients with schizophrenia
(number males and number females) who fulfilled the criteria for
schizophrenia (undifferentiated type, number cases; paranoid type, number
cases; disorganized type, number cases; and catatonic type, number cases),
according to the American Psychiatric Association.number They
were physically healthy without any history of substance
abuse, neurological disorder, delirium, or dementia and
without any clinically significant findings, including a clinical
laboratory examination, electrocardiography, and electroencephalography.
The mean number SD of age, body weight, and
drug of illness were number.number number number.number years, number.number number number.number kg,
and number.number number number.number months, respectively. This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of the
Ryukyus, and all patients and their families gave written
informed consent to participate in this study.
drug Treatment
Before drug coadministration, the subjects had
received drug for number_number weeks. It has been shown that
drug concentrations of both drug and drug
reach steady state by number weeks after repeated drug
administration.number The daily dose was fixed at number drug in number cases
and number drug in number cases and was given once a day at number.number hours.
The drug coadministered were biperiden number unit in number cases and
drug number_number unit in number cases. Female patients did not
receive drug contraceptives. The doses of these coadministered
drug were fixed throughout the study period. drug
number unit in equally divided doses was coadministered at number.number
and number.number hours to all subjects for number week. Blood samples were
taken before the drug coadministration commenced
and then again number week after completion.
Clinical Assessment
On the same day drug blood sampling, severity of illness
and side effects were evaluated using the Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale (PANSS)number and the Udvalg for Kliniske
Unders gelser (UKU) side effects rating scale,number respectively.
Nineteen items were selected from the UKU side effects rating
scale to assess the side effects of drug,whichwere further
separated into number clusters: psychic (concentration difficulties,
asthenia, sleepiness, failing memory, depression, and tension);
neurological (dystonia, rigidity, hypokinesia, hyperkinesia,
tremor, akathisia, and increased salivation); and autonomic
(accommodation disturbances, reduced salivation, constipation,
micturition disturbances, orthostatic dizziness, and palpitations).
Analytical Methods
drug concentrations of drug and drug
were measured using the liquid chromatography
method with mass spectrometric detection of Kubo et al.number The
lowest limit of detection for both compounds was number.number unit
using number.number mL of drug, and the accuracy for drug
and drug was in the range number.number% to number.number%
and number.number% to number.number% at all concentrations, respectively.
For the determination of CYPnumberDnumber genotype, DNA was
isolated from peripheral leucocytes using a QIA-amp DNA
Blood Maxi (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan). Long polymerase
chain reaction analysis was used to detect the *number allele.number The
*number and *number allele were identified drug the numberC-T and numberG-A
mutations using number-step polymerase chain reaction analyses drug
described by Johansson et alnumber and Kubota et al,number respectively.
These mutated alleles and the wild-type allele, which were
regarded drug predominant drug other CYPnumberDnumber alleles in the
population, were selected based on a previous view on the
frequency of CYPnumberDnumber alleles in Japanese.number drug drug
concentration was also measured using a particleenhanced
turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay (Dimension;
drug Behring, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed by the Wilcoxon
signed rank test used for the comparison of the drug drug
concentrations and the scores of clinical assessments. The
Spearman rank test was applied to analyze the correlation
between changes in drug and drug
concentrations before and after drug coadministration
and both the CYPnumberDnumber genotype and the drug
concentration of drug. A P value of number.number or less
was regarded drug statistically significant. SPSS number.number for

statistical analyses.",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial,2
17015053,SLCOnumberBnumber polymorphism and sex affect the pharmacokinetics of drug but not drug.,"drug is a hydrophilic substrate and drug a lipophilic substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide numberBnumber encoded by SLCOnumberBnumber. Our aim was to compare the effects of SLCOnumberBnumber polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of drug and drug. We recruited number healthy volunteers (number men and number woman) with the homozygous SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberCC genotype, number (number men and number women) with the heterozygous c.numberTC genotype, and number (number men and number women) with the homozygous c.numberTT genotype (control subjects). In a crossover study each subject ingested a single number-drug dose of drug and drug with a washout period of at least number week. drug drug and drug concentrations were measured for number hours. In men with the c.numberCC genotype, the mean peak concentration in drug and area under the drug concentration-time curve from time number to infinity of drug were number% (number% confidence interval [CI], number%-number%; P = .number) and number% (number% CI, number%-number%; P = .number) greater than those in men with the c.numberTT genotype and number% (number% CI, number%-number%; P = .number) and number% (number% CI, number%-number%; P = .number) greater than those in men with the c.numberTC genotype. In addition, women with the c.numberTT genotype had a number% (number% CI, number%-number%; P = .number) greater peak concentration in drug and a number% (number% CI, number%-number%; P = .number) greater area under the drug concentration-time curve from time number to infinity than men with the c.numberTT genotype. The pharmacokinetic variables of drug were approximately similar among women with different SLCOnumberBnumber genotypes. drug significant differences were seen in the pharmacokinetics of drug between subjects with different SLCOnumberBnumber genotypes or between the sexes. SLCOnumberBnumber polymorphism has a large effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug but not drug. This suggests that the lipophilic drug can penetrate the hepatocyte drug membrane via passive diffusion or that uptake transporters other than organic anion transporting polypeptide numberBnumber mainly mediate its hepatic uptake. Moreover, the results suggest that sex may affect the pharmacokinetics of drug and possibly the functional consequences of SLCOnumberBnumber polymorphism.","METHODS
Subjects. A total of number healthy white volunteers participated
in the study after giving written informed

were drug described previously.number The subjects were
genotyped for the CYPnumberCnumber*number (c.numberA C) allele with
TaqMan Pre-Developed Assay Reagents for Allelic
Discrimination (Applied Biosystems) by use of the
number Real-Time PCR System according to the manufacturer s
instructions. Only subjects with the ABCCnumber
c.numberCC and CYPnumberCnumber c.numberAA reference genotype
were recruited. The subjects were selected on the basis
of the SLCOnumberBnumber g. numberG A, g. numberA C,
c.numberA G, and c.numberT C variants and were allocated
into one of number groups according to genotype. The control
group included number subjects (number men and number women) with
the homozygous reference genotype at each position
(c.numberTT group). Their mean age ( SD) was number   number
years, with a mean height of number   number cm, mean weight
of number   number kg, and mean body mass index (BMI) of

subjects (number men and number women) heterozygous for
c.numberT C SNP (c.numberTC group), including number who
were heterozygous for the SLCOnumberBnumber*number haplotype
(g. numberG, g. numberA, c.numberG, c.numberC), number who
were heterozygous for the *number haplotype (GCGC), and
number who were heterozygous for the *number haplotype
(AAGC). The haplotypes and diplotypes were statistically
inferred with the PHASE drug, version
number.number.number.number-numbera Of the subjects with the c.numberTC genotype,
number had the c.numberAG genotype and number had the c.numberGG
genotype. The mean age of the subjects with the
c.numberTC genotype was number   number years, with a mean
height of number   number cm, mean weight of number   number kg, and
mean BMI of number.number   number.number unitnumber. The third group
comprised number subjects (number men and number woman) with the
homozygous c.numberCC genotype (c.numberCC group).
Their mean age was number   number years, with a mean height
of number   number cm, mean weight of number   number kg, and mean
BMI of number.number   number.number unitnumber. The subjects were ascertained
to be healthy by medical history, physical examination,

drug at number AM. In both phases timed blood samples were
drawn before and at number.number, number, number.number, number, number, number, number, number, number, and number
hours after the administration of a drug. The blood samples
(number to number mL each) were taken into tubes that contained
drug drug and placed on ice
immediately after sampling. drug was separated within
number minutes and stored at  number C until analysis. The use of
other drug was drug for number week and the use of
drug products was drug for number days before administration
of drug or drug.
Determination of drug drug concentrations.
drug drug concentrations were quantified by
use of an Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX Q-Trap
liquid chromatography_tandem mass spectrometry system
(Sciex Division of MDS, Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
Chromatographic separation was achieved on a
drug Cnumber column (internal diameter, number   number.number mm;
particle size, number.number mm) (drug, Milford, Mass) protected
by a drug Cnumber guard column (internal diameter,
number   number.number mm; particle size, number.number mm) (drug).
The mobile phase consisted of number-mmol/L drug
drug (drug number.number) and drug. The mobile phase
gradient comprised number minute at number% drug drug,
number minutes to number% drug drug, number minutes at
number% drug drug, and number minutes at number% drug
drug, giving a total chromatographic run time
of number minutes. An aliquot of number  L was injected at a
mobile phase flow rate of number  L/min. The mass spectrometer
was operated in positive IonSpray mode
(Sciex Division of MDS), and the samples were analyzed
via multiple reaction monitoring by use of precursor
ion to product ion for drug and internal
standard (drug drug). The ion transitions were
mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) number.number to m/z number for drug
and m/z number to m/z number for drug drug. The
limit of quantification of drug drug was number.number
drug/mL, and the between-day coefficients of variation
were number.number% at number.number unit number.number% at number unit and number.number%
at number unit (n   number).

Pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of drug
and drug was characterized by the peak
concentration in drug (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax),
elimination half-life (t_), and AUC from time number to
infinity [AUC(number- )]. The terminal log-linear part of
each concentration-time curve was identified visually,
and the elimination rate constant (ke) was determined
from natural log_transformed data with linear
regression analysis. The t_ was calculated by use
of the following equation: t_   lnnumber/ke. AUC(number- )
was calculated by a combination of the linear and
log-linear trapezoidal rules, with extrapolation to
infinity by division of the last measured concentration
by ke.
Statistical analysis. The results are expressed drug
mean   SD in the text and tables and, for clarity, drug
mean   SEM in the figures. Statistical comparisons of
the pharmacokinetic variables of drug and drug
between subjects with the SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberTT,
c.numberTC, and c.numberCC genotypes and the sexes were
done by use of ANOVA and pairwise testing with the
Tukey test. Equality of group variances was tested with
the Levene statistic. Compatibility of the residuals with
normal distribution was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk
test. In case of unequal variances or unsatisfactory
distribution of the residuals, the data were logarithmically
transformed before analysis or tested with the
Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise testing with the Mann-
Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction, drug appropriate.
The tmax data were analyzed by the Kruskal-
Wallis test with pairwise testing with the Mann-
Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction. The
possible contribution of subject characteristics (sex,
weight, and BMI) to variability in the AUC(number- ) of
drug and drug was investigated by use of a
forward stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. A
P value threshold of .number was used for entering and
removing independent variables from the model. The
data were analyzed with the statistical drug SPSS
number.number for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, Ill). On the basis of
previous data on the pharmacokinetics of drug
and drug,number the number of subjects in each genotype
group was estimated to be sufficient to detect a
number% greater AUC(number- ) of drug and drug in
subjects with the c.numberTC genotype than in those with
the c.numberTT genotype, drug well drug a number% greater
AUC(number- ) of drug and drug in subjects
with the c.numberCC genotype than in those with the
c.numberTT genotype, with a power of at least number% (

from the patient s medical files.
Statistical Analysis
drug and drug blood concentrations were compared
between different genotypes by nonparametric analyses
(Kruskal-Wallis test for number, Mann-Whitney U test for number groups).
Correlations between drug concentrations and CYPnumberAnumber or
CYPnumberA activity were assessed by Spearman test, and multivariate
analyses were performed using linear regression (backward
method). A P G number.number was considered to indicate statistical
significance. All statistical tests were performed in the whole
group of patients and in the number subgroups with and without
drug drug inhibition by drug could mask the
potential influence of other factors. Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS version number.number (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). For
ABCBnumber polymorphisms, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested,
and linkage disequilibrium (Lewontin s D coefficient) was
estimated with STATA (version number; Stata Corporation, College
Station, Tex). Haplotypes were inferred using the haplo.em function
in R (http://www.r-project.org/), which uses expectationmaximization
algorithm. drug none of the inferred haplotypes had a
posterior probability below number%, haplotype uncertainty can be
considered drug minimal. Genetic association studies were conducted
using the haplo.score function in R (which uses generalized
linear models and takes haplotype uncertainty into account)

12172343,Inhibition of drug metabolism by drug in patients with schizophrenia: a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interaction.,"The effect of drug on the steady-state drug concentrations of drug and its active metabolite number-hydroxyrisperidone (number-OH-drug) was evaluated in number patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients stabilized on drug (number-number unit) received additional drug (number unit) to treat concomitant depression. One patient dropped out after number week due to the occurrence of akathisia associated with markedly increased drug drug concentrations. In the other subjects, mean drug concentrations of drug increased during drug administration from number +/- number unit at baseline to number +/- number at week number (p < number.number), while the levels of number-OH-drug were not significantly affected. After number weeks of combined treatment, the levels of the active moiety (sum of the concentrations of drug and number-OH-drug) increased by number% (range, number-number%, p < number.number) compared with baseline. The mean drug drug/number-OH-drug ratio also increased significantly. During the second week of adjunctive therapy, two patients developed Parkinsonian symptoms, which were controlled with drug drug. These findings indicate that drug, a potent inhibitor of the drug Pnumber enzyme CYPnumberDnumber and a less potent inhibitor of CYPnumberAnumber, reduces the clearance of drug by inhibiting its number-hydroxylation or alternative metabolic pathways. This interaction may lead to toxic drug drug concentrations. In addition to careful clinical observation, monitoring drug drug levels may be of value in patients given adjunctive therapy with drug.","Patients and Methods

New studies are needed to confirm that drug could have mild inductive effects.","PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Twenty-one outpatients (number men and number women, aged number_
number years) participated in the study. They had a diagnosis of
bipolar (n = number) or schizoaffective (n = number) disorder according to
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
IV, and were stabilized on drug but required treatment
with a drug stabilizer. The protocol was approved by a local
Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained
from the patients or their relatives.
Study Design
Before receiving adjunctive drug drug a drug
stabilizer, all patients received an drug constant dose
(number_number unit) for number month; this dose was kept constant
throughout the study. In addition to drug concentration
monitoring, compliance with drug treatment was also
checked by drug count. Initial drug doses were decided by
the treating physician. Doses were subsequently individualized
according to clinical response, usually within number_number days, and
then maintained stable. Use of other drug known to act drug
inhibitors or inducers of drug metabolism was not
allowed.number Concomitant treatment with other drug,
when present, remained unchanged.
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were
drawn into heparinized tubes at number:number AM (number_number hours after the
drug dose) the week before starting drug treatment
(baseline), and after number and number weeks of drug coadministration.
drug was separated immediately and stored at
number C until assayed.
Tolerability was evaluated by interview and medical
examination at baseline, and after number and number weeks of combined
therapy. Because this was an open, uncontrolled, design using
a small heterogeneous sample, the clinical efficacy of the
combination was not assessed.
drug Assays
The steady-state drug drug concentrations were
measured by drug-performance liquid chromatography according
to the method of D Arrigo et alnumber; the assay quantification
limit was number unit. To ensure treatment compliance,
drug drug concentrations were determined by enzymemultiplied
immunoassay; the limit of quantification was number unit.
Statistics
drug drug concentrations at baseline and
during drug comedication were compared by pairedsamples
t tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons. Means number SD of variables are reported. A P
value ,number.number was regarded drug statistically significant.
In an analysis of the repeated measures provided by the
patients, the effect of drug concentrations on the possible
changes in drug concentrations was investigated by
fitting a random intercept linear model.number In this model, the
dependent variable was the difference between the patient s
drug concentration measured at a particular time (after number
or number weeks) and his or her baseline drug concentration.
The independent variables were the patient s age, current
smoking status, drug concentrations, and undergoing
number weeks of drug treatment (compared with number weeks). To
investigate a possible difference in drug effects between
the fourth and second week of drug treatment, a week_
drug concentration interaction term was also included in
the model. Analyses of residuals and intercept predictors
suggested that the model fit well. Statistical analyses were
performed with the Stata software.number",Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial,2
