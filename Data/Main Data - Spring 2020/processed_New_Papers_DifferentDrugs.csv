23738582,drug substantially increases steady-state drug exposure in healthy volunteers.,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the drug Pnumber (CYP) numberAnumber and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) numberBnumber inhibitor drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug. We also aimed to evaluate the impact of CYPnumberCnumber and SLCOnumberBnumber (encoding for OATPnumberBnumber) genotypes and their drug. We assessed the effect of the OATP and CYPnumberA inhibitor drug on drug pharmacokinetics at steady state and concurrently quantified changes of CYPnumberA activity using drug as a probe drug. Sixteen healthy volunteers received therapeutic doses of drug (number_mg twice daily) for number days and drug (number_mg twice daily) concomitantly for the last number days, and drug pharmacokinetics was assessed on days number, number and number. drug significantly increased drug area under the drug concentration-time curve of the dosing interval number.number-fold and peak concentration number.number-fold in all participants irrespective of the genotype. drug also reduced CYPnumberA activity (drug clearance) in all participants; however, these changes were not correlated to the changes of drug clearance. drug substantially increases the exposure to drug, suggesting that dose reductions may be necessary.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S.

24246616,Effects of drug on the antiplatelet effects and pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy volunteers.,"Several studies have suggested that drug-pump inhibitors (PPIs), mostly drug, interact with drug efficacy by inhibiting the formation of its active metabolite via CYPnumberCnumber inhibition. Whether this occurs with all PPIs is a matter of debate. As drug is a less potent CYPnumberCnumber inhibitor than other PPIs, we studied the interaction between drug and the antiplatelet actions and pharmacokinetics of drug. To demonstrate the drug-inferiority of drug drug placebo using change in platelet reactivity index (PRI; drug-stimulated phosphoprotein [VASP] assay) in a predefined population of good drug responders. drug was used as the positive control. In this randomized three-period crossover study in healthy volunteers, number healthy men received drug (number unit for number days) with placebo, drug (numbermg/day) or drug (numbermg/day). drug antiplatelet effects and disposition kinetics were assessed on day number of drug therapy. drug-inferiority threshold was predefined as an upper limit of the number% confidence interval for the difference in change in PRI between placebo and drug of<number% in good drug responders. In good drug responders (inhibition of VASP index>number%), the drug antiplatelet effect remained drug-inferior to placebo during drug (difference number.number% [-number.number; number.number]) but not drug (difference number.number% [number.number; number.number]) co-administration. The AUCnumber-number and Cmax of active drug metabolite decreased with both drug and drug, and conditions of bioequivalence were not met, except for AUCnumber-number with drug. drug does not interact with drug to the same extent as drug. However, under our experimental conditions and drug-pump inhibitor doses, there was drug significant pharmacodynamic interaction between drug or drug and drug, despite a significant decrease in the formation of drug active metabolite.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,Methods Study design This prospective placeboand active drug open label

26597253,"The Effect of drug, a MATEnumber-drug Inhibitor, on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of drug.","Pharmacokinetic outcomes of transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions (TMDDIs) are increasingly being evaluated clinically. The goal of our study was to determine the effects of drug inhibition of multidrug and drug extrusion protein number (MATEnumber), using drug, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in healthy volunteers. Volunteers received drug alone or with drug in a crossover design. As a positive control, the longitudinal effects of drug on the drug levels of drug (an endogenous substrate of MATEnumber) were quantified in parallel. drug unbound concentrations in drug reached number M, thus exceeding the in vitro concentrations that inhibit MATEnumber [concentration of drug producing number % inhibition (ICnumber) number.number M]. Based on current regulatory guidance, these concentrations are expected to inhibit MATEnumber clinically [i.e. drug unbound drug drug concentration (C max,u)/ICnumber >number.number]. Consistent with MATEnumber inhibition, drug administration significantly altered drug drug and urine levels in opposing directions (p < number.number). Interestingly, drug increased the estimated bioavailability of drug [cumulative amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine from time zero to infinity (A e )/dose; p < number.number] without affecting its systemic exposure [area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) or drug concentration in drug (C max)] as a result of a counteracting increase in drug drug clearance. Moreover, drug-drug co-therapy caused a transient effect on drug drug tolerance tests [area under the drug drug concentration-time curve between time zero and number.number h (AUCglu,number.number); p < number.number]. These results suggest that drug may improve the bioavailability and enhance the drug clearance of drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't ;Research Support, N.I.H.,

24036846,drug drug does not affect drug pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.,"drug upset is a common side effect of drug therapy, and drug drug is frequently used concomitantly, either as drug or as drug supplementation. With the increasing number of drug agents in cancer therapy, drug drug-drug interactions are becoming more relevant. drug has already been shown to be absorbed to a much lesser extent when co-administered with drug pump inhibitors. Because exposure to sub-therapeutic concentrations of anticancer drug such as drug may result in selection of resistant clones and ultimately relapse, we studied the effect of a drug drug supplement (drug Ultra number ) on drug pharmacokinetics. drug drug may be co-administered with drug without significantly affecting the pharmacokinetics of drug and potentially impacting efficacy. drug is a second-generation drug drug kinase inhibitor with superior efficacy compared with drug mesylate in the treatment for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. drug drug is commonly used as a source of drug supplementation or as drug to ameliorate the gastrointestinal side effects associated with drug, which could have unknown effects on drug drug. The purpose of this study was to provide information on the effect of drug drug on the PK of drug in healthy volunteers. Healthy subjects were enrolled in a two-period, open-label, single-institution, randomized, cross-drug, fixed-schedule study. In one period, each subject received number drug of drug p.o. In the other period, number,number drug of drug drug (number X drug Ultra number ) was administered p.o. number min prior to the drug dose. drug samples were collected at specified timepoints, concentrations of drug were quantitated by drug-MS, and data were analyzed drug-compartmentally. Eleven subjects were evaluable. drug supplementation did not significantly affect drug pharmacokinetic parameters including area under the drug concentration versus time curve (number.number _g/drug h alone vs. number.number _g/drug h with drug drug, p = number.number; number % power); drug drug concentration (C(max)) (number.number _g/drug alone vs. number.number _g/drug with drug drug, p = number.number); or half-life (number.number h alone vs. number.number h with drug drug, p = number.number).

28867665,Pharmacogenomic Variability of drug Baclofen Clearance and Clinical Response in Children With Cerebral Palsy.,"Pharmacogenomic variability can contribute to differences in pharmacokinetics and clinical responses. Pediatric patients with cerebral palsy with genetic variations have not been studied for these potential differences. To determine the genetic sources of variation in drug baclofen clearance and clinical responses. Pharmacogenomic add-on study to determine variability in drug baclofen clearance and clinical responses. Multicenter study based in academic pediatric cerebral palsy clinics. A total of number patients with cerebral palsy who had participated in an drug baclofen pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study. Of number participants in a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic trial, number underwent genetic analysis of number key genes and number single-nucleotide polymorphisms involved in drug drug, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Associations between genotypes and phenotypes of baclofen disposition (weight-corrected and allometrically scaled clearance) and clinical endpoints (improvement from baseline in mean hamstring Modified Tardieu Scale scores from baseline for improvement of Rnumber spastic catch) were determined by univariate analysis with correction for multiple testing by false discovery rate. Primary outcome measures were the genotypic and phenotypic variability of drug baclofen in allometrically scaled clearance and change in the Modified Tardieu Scale angle compared to baseline. After univariate analysis of the data, the SNP of ABCCnumber (rsnumber, heterozygous AT versus the reference TT genotype) was associated with a number-fold increase in drug baclofen clearance (mean number.number   standard deviation number.number unit/kg for the AT genotype versus number.number   number.number unit/kg for the TT genotype, adjusted P < .number). Clinical responses were associated with decreased spasticity by Modified Tardieu Scale in allelic variants with SNPs ABCCnumber, SLCnumberAnumber, and PPARD. Genetic variation in ABCCnumber affecting drug baclofen clearance highlights the need for continued studies of genetic polymorphisms to better characterize variable drug response in children with cerebral palsy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCCnumber, SLCnumberAnumber, and PPARD were associated with varied responses, which warrants further investigation to determine their effect on spasticity.

22464259,"A randomized, number-period, crossover design study to assess the effects of drug, drug, drug, and drug on the steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in healthy volunteers.","The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different drug pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug. Metabolism of drug requires drug Pnumbers (CYPs), including CYPnumberCnumber. However, PPIs may inhibit CYPnumberCnumber, potentially reducing the effectiveness of drug. A randomized, open-label, number-period, crossover study of healthy subjects (n = number, age number to number years, homozygous for CYPnumberCnumber extensive metabolizer genotype, confined, standardized diet) was conducted. drug number drug with or without a drug (drug number drug, drug number drug, drug number drug, or, as a positive control to maximize potential interaction and demonstrate assay sensitivity, drug number drug) was given daily for number days. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were assessed on days number and number. Pharmacodynamic end-points were drug-stimulated phosphoprotein PnumberY(number) platelet reactivity index, maximal platelet aggregation to number and number _mol/l adenosine diphosphate, and VerifyNow PnumberYnumber platelet response units. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses with drug demonstrated assay sensitivity. The area under the curve for drug active metabolite decreased significantly with drug but not with drug or drug. Similarly, drug but not drug or drug significantly reduced the effect of drug on drug-stimulated phosphoprotein platelet reactivity index. All PPIs decreased the peak drug concentration of drug active metabolite (drug > drug > drug > drug) and showed a corresponding order of potency for effects on maximal platelet aggregation and platelet response units. Generation of drug active metabolite and inhibition of platelet function were reduced less by the coadministration of drug or drug with drug than by the coadministration of drug or drug. These results suggest that the potential of PPIs to attenuate the efficacy of drug could be minimized by the use of drug or drug rather than drug or drug.","Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,Methods The study design enrollment criteria drug PK PD statistics described detail Online Appendix To eliminate variables known influence drug and or drug metabolism homozygous CYPnumberCnumber extensive metabolizer genotype healthy subjects enrolled confined clinical research unit

24722393,Geneva cocktail for drug pnumber and P-glycoprotein activity assessment using dried drug spots.,"The suitability of the capillary dried drug spot (DBS) sampling method was assessed for simultaneous phenotyping of drug Pnumber (CYP) drug and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) using a cocktail approach. drug volunteers received an drug cocktail capsule containing low doses of the probes drug (CYPnumberBnumber), drug (CYPnumberCnumber), drug (CYPnumberCnumber), drug (CYPnumberDnumber), drug (CYPnumberA), and drug (P-gp) with coffee/drug (CYPnumberAnumber) on four occasions. They received the cocktail alone (session number), and with the CYP inhibitors drug and drug (session number) and drug (session number). In session number, subjects received the cocktail after a number-day pretreatment with the inducer drug. The concentrations of probes/metabolites were determined in DBS and drug using a single drug chromatography-drug mass spectrometry method. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug were comparable in DBS and drug. Important modulation of CYP and P-gp activities was observed in the presence of inhibitors and the inducer. Minimally invasive one- and three-point (at number, number, and number h) DBS-sampling methods were found to reliably reflect CYP and P-gp activities at each session.","Evaluation Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC4151019,"Subjects. This study (registration NCTnumber) was approved by the ethics committee of Geneva University Hospitals (ID: number number) and the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic).

After giving written informed consent, number healthy male volunteers were included in the study. Their median age was number years (range: number number years) and median body mass index was number.number (range: number.number number.number) (see Supplementary Table Snumber online for details). One subject was from North Africa, one was of mixed Caucasian and African origin, and all the drug were Caucasians. All of the subjects were nonsmokers and had normal results on physical examination, electrocardiogram, and drug function test and were not taking any drug. Poor CYPnumberDnumber (*number/*number; *number/*number; *number/*number), CYPnumberCnumber (*number/*number; *number/*number; *number/*number), or CYPnumberCnumber (*number/*number) metabolizers were not included in the study. Subjects were not permitted to drink grapefruit juice for at least number week before and throughout the study period and were required to abstain from drug and drug-containing products at least number_h before each study session.

Study design. This open-label study was performed in four sessions with at least number-week washout period between each session. Cocktail capsules containing low-dose bupropion (number_mg), drug (number_mg), drug (number_mg), drug (number_mg), drug (number_mg), and drug (number_mg) were produced by the pharmacy of Geneva University Hospitals under good manufacturing practice conditions. At each session, after an overnight fast, volunteers received an drug cocktail capsule together with a cup of coffee (drug: number_mg) or drug (drug: number_mg). They were given their first meal number_h after cocktail administration and a second meal number_h later. All the volunteers received the treatments in the same order. At session number, volunteers received only the cocktail capsule with coffee or drug. At session number, volunteers received one dose of drug (number_mg) number_h before cocktail administration, followed by a second dose of drug (number_mg) together with drug (number_mg) number_h before cocktail administration (CYPnumberAnumber, CYPnumberBnumber, CYPnumberCnumber, CYPnumberCnumber, and CYPnumberA inhibition). At session number, each subject was given number_mg of drug (CYPnumberDnumber and P-gp inhibitor) number_h before cocktail administration. The CYP and P-gp inhibition was divided in two sessions due to the potential interaction (QT interval prolongation) between drug and drug. Seven days before the fourth session, volunteers were given seven tablets of drug (number_mg) and were asked to take one tablet every evening until the evening before the session (induction of CYP isoforms and P-gp). They were specifically asked about their compliance with the drug regimen.

At each session, capillary and venous blood samples were collected simultaneously before and at number.number, number, number, number, number, number, and number_h after cocktail administration. Capillary whole blood (number  l) was collected on a Whatman number filter paper card (Westborough, MA) after a small finger prick (drug Microtainer; Contact-Activated Lancet, Plymouth, UK) using a volumetric micropipette (Rainin, Oakland, CA), whereas venous blood was collected into tubes containing drug (drug Vacutainer, Plymouth, UK). drug from venous blood was obtained after centrifugation at number,number_rpm for number_min and stored together with dried DBS cards at _number  C.

Analytical methods. The cocktail substrates and their CYP-specific metabolites were quantified in drug and DBS using a single reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method operating in dual electrospray ionization mode, as previously described.number The substances of interest were extracted from DBS samples using drug, whereas protein precipitation using drug was used for drug extraction. Both methods (those for DBS and drug) were fully validated according to international criteria.number

Genotyping. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood (number  l) using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Switzerland). The detection of CYPnumberCnumber (alleles *number and *number) and number CYPnumberDnumber alleles was performed using the AmpliChip CYPnumber test (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) as previously described.number CYPnumberBnumber*number and CYPnumberCnumber*number genotypes were determined using commercially available TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. CYPnumberCnumber*number and CYPnumberCnumber*number genotypes, as well as ABCBnumber GnumberT/A and CnumberT polymorphisms, were determined by means of multiplex PCR with fluorescent probes (Lightmix; TibMolbiol, Berlin, Germany) and melting curve analysis on a LightCyclernumber (Roche Diagnostics).

Data analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by standard noncompartmental methods using WinNonlin version number.number.number (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). The results are presented as mean values (  SD) and geometric mean ratios with number% confidence intervals. Single-point MRs were determined as the concentration ratio between the metabolite and the administered substance, i.e., par/caf, OH-bup/bup, OH-flb/flb, OH-opz/opz, dor/dem, and OH-mdz/mdz, at different time points. MRs at the inhibition or induction sessions were compared with those of the cocktail-alone session using a nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlation between AUC ratios and single-point MRs was established using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version number (Chicago, IL). P values   number.number were considered statistically significant."

16232205,Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic study of drug administered once every number days.,"drug is a novel drug anticancer drug that disrupts the Gnumber/S phase of the cell cycle. The objectives of this phase I study of drug were to estimate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD), to determine the recommended dose for phase II, and to clarify the pharmacokinetic profile of drug and its relation to polymorphisms of CYPnumberCnumber (*number, *number) and CYPnumberCnumber (*number, *number) in Japanese patients. Patients received number-number-h i.v. infusions of drug (number, number, number, number or number unitnumber) on day number of a number-day cycle. Twenty-one patients received between one and eight cycles of drug. The dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) comprised leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, elevation of aspartate aminotransferase, colitis, and ileus. The mean area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) for successive dose levels increased in a drug-dose-proportional manner. Two patients were heterozygous for the CYPnumberCnumber mutation. For CYPnumberCnumber, eight patients were wild type and the remainder had heterozygous (n = number) or homozygous mutations (n = number). Regarding the CYPnumberCnumber genotype, the AUC of patients with mutant alleles were higher than those of patients with wild type at a dose of number unitnumber or more. The severity of toxic effects, such as myelosuppression, seemed to depend on the AUC. drug partial responses were observed. One patient treated at a dose of number unitnumber experienced a drug tumor volume reduction of number.number%. The MTD was estimated to be number unitnumber. A dose of number unitnumber is recommended for further phase II studies. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of drug seemed to be influenced by CYPnumberCnumber genotype. The observed safety profile and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity warrant further investigation of this drug in monotherapy or in drug drug.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of drug given for number days on selected drug metabolizing enzyme activities. Seven healthy volunteers were given drug number drug daily for number days. Activities of the drug metabolizing drug CYPnumberAnumber, CYPnumberCnumber, CYPnumberDnumber, CYPnumberEnumber and N-acetyltransferase were determined using the probe drug drug, mephenytoin, drug, drug, and drug, respectively. drug was administered before drug administration and after the second and eleventh doses of drug, while the other probe drug were given before drug administration and after the eleventh drug dose. drug administration markedly inhibited drug number-hydroxylation by more than number%, but did not affect metabolism of drug or mephenytoin. drug Nnumber-demethylation was decreased by number% (P < number.number). drug concentrations were markedly elevated by drug administration resulting in a nearly number-fold increase in the drug acetylation index, calculated as the drug concentration ratio of drug to drug. CYP-mediated drug N-hydroxylation was not significantly altered. These data suggest that drug-mediated inhibition is predominantly drug for CYPnumberEnumber. The magnitude of CYPnumberEnumber inhibition was similar after both acute and chronic drug administration. The effects on drug Nnumber-demethylation (CYPnumberAnumber) and drug metabolism suggest that chronic drug administration may affect multiple drug metabolizing drug, which could potentially complicate the use of chronically administered drug as a diagnostic inhibitor of CYPnumberEnumber.",Journal Article,None,Methods Eight drug healthy male volunteers agreed participate study providing written informed consent This study approved local Institutional Review Board All subjects nonsmokers self reported healthy confirmed medical history physical examination drug chemistries urinalysis Subjects instructed abstain drug drug containing products least two days study visit none subjects receiving counter drug drug Subjects received probe drug drug number_mg three occasions prior drug administration second daily drug dose eleventh daily drug dose Subjects also received drug drug probe drug drug number_mg drug number_mg drug number_mg mephenytoin number_mg prior drug administration eleventh daily dose Subjects received drug number_mg orally morning doses administered clinic personnel All probe drug given orally eight ounces drug morning overnight fast The five probe drug administered simultaneously cocktail previously shown devoid interaction doses used In session heparinized drug samples collected prior drug administration number_h probe administration Urine collected number number_h container ascorbic drug preservative unstable drug hydroxylamine metabolite drug harvested centrifugation urine aliquots stored frozen _number_ _C analysed Analytical techniques The following drug metabolites measured high performance drug chromatographic techniques described previously drug drug drug drug number hydroxychlorzoxazone drug number hydroxychlorzoxazone urine drug DDS drug hydroxylamine HDA urine drug drug drug drug DB number hydroxydebrisoquine HDB urine number_ hydroxymephenytoin HMP urine The within between day coefficients variation assays  number All assay procedures utilized study tested probe drug metabolites ensure analytical interference would occur simultaneous administration Data analysis drug number hydroxychlorzoxazone pharmacokinetic data presented detail previously In report drug metabolic ratio calculated concentration ratio number hydroxychlorzoxazone drug number_h drug sample used index CYPnumberEnumber activity The concentration drug dimethylxanthine divided concentration drug number_h drug sample used assess CYPnumberAnumber activity The ability N hydroxylate drug CYP mediated estimated urinary recovery ratio equation image HDA urinary recovery drug hydroxylamine number_h urine sample DDS number_h urinary recovery drug Acetylator phenotype defined ratio drug drug number_h drug sample subjects acetylation ratio greater classified drug acetylators The area concentration time curve AUC drug drug number_h drug administration calculated trapezoidal rule The activity CYPnumberDnumber estimated using drug recovery ratio equation image HDB DB urinary recoveries number hydroxydebrisoquine drug number_h respectively The total urinary recovery number_ hydroxymephenytoin  mol used phenotypic measure CYPnumberCnumber activity Statistical analysis Data presented median range Statistical test values Hodges Lehmann estimates median differences exact confidence intervals Computations performed using StatXact Cytel Software Corporation USA Differences considered statistically significant confidence intervals excluded zero

29411268,"A Phase number Pharmacokinetic Study of drug Bitartrate Delayed-Release Capsules Following drug Administration with Orange Juice, drug, or drug in Cystinosis.","Cystinosis is a rare, metabolic, autosomal recessive, genetic lysosomal storage disorder characterized by an accumulation of drug in drug organs and tissues. drug bitartrate (CB) is a drug-depleting aminothiol drug approved in the United States and Europe in immediate-release and delayed-release (DR) formulations for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis in children and adults. It is recommended that CBDR be administered with fruit juice (except drug juice) for drug drug. drug is a drug pump inhibitor that inhibits drug drug secretion and, theoretically, may cause the premature release of drug by increasing intragastric pH, thereby affecting the PK of CBDR. This open-label, three-period, randomized study in healthy adult subjects was designed primarily to compare the pharmacokinetics of CBDR capsules after a single drug dose administered with orange juice, drug, or multiple drug doses of drug with drug at steady state. A total of number subjects were randomly assigned to receive study agents in one of two treatment sequences. All subjects completed the study and baseline characteristics of the overall population and the two treatment sequence populations were similar. Peak mean drug drug concentrations following co-administration of CBDR capsules with orange juice (number unit) were higher compared with co-administration with drug (number unit) or drug number drug and drug (number unit). Mean time to peak drug concentration was shorter with drug co-administration (number.number h) compared with orange juice (number.number h) or drug (number.number h). Statistical comparisons between treatment groups indicated that exposure as assessed by AUC Overall, the pharmacokinetics of drug bitartrate DR capsules are not significantly impacted by co-administration with orange juice, drug only, or drug (with drug).

28865153,Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential of drug (drug number) using cocktail probes in patients with advanced solid tumours.,"This phase number, open-label, crossover study sought to evaluate drug-drug interactions between drug and drug Pnumber (CYP) substrates and drug and P-glycoprotein. The effect of drug doses on the pharmacokinetics of the probe drug for CYPnumberAnumber (drug), CYPnumberCnumber (S-drug), CYPnumberCnumber (drug), and drug (drug), and for P-glycoprotein (drug) was investigated in number patients with advanced cancer using a cocktail probe approach. Patients received single doses of probe drug alone and, after number days of treatment, with drug number drug twice daily. The ratios of geometric least squares mean (number% confidence interval) for the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration in the presence/absence of drug were number.number (number.number-number.number) for drug, number.number (number.number-number.number) for S-drug, number.number (number.number-number.number) for drug, number.number (number.number-number.number) for drug, and number.number (number.number-number.number) for drug. Similar effects were observed for drug drug concentrations; the ratio for drug in the presence/absence of drug was number.number (number.number-number.number). The data suggest that drug number drug twice daily has either a minimal or drug effect on the pharmacokinetics of probe drug for CYPnumberAnumber, CYPnumberCnumber, CYPnumberCnumber and drug

27518170,Evaluation of a Potential Metabolism-Mediated drug-drug Interaction Between drug and drug in Healthy Volunteers.,"To evaluate the impact of drug on the pharmacokinetic profile of drug and its main active metabolite (glucuronidated form), number-hydroxyatomoxetine-O-glucuronide, in healthy volunteers. An open-label, drug-randomized, two-period, sequential clinical trial was conducted as follows: during Period I (Reference), each volunteer received a single drug dose of number drug drug, whilst during Period II (Test), a drug of number drug drug and number drug drug was administered to all volunteers, after a pretreatment regimen with drug for number days. Next, after determining drug and number-hydroxyatomoxetine-O-glucuronide drug concentrations, their pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental method and subsequently compared to determine any statistically significant differences between the two periods. drug intake influenced all the pharmacokinetic parameters of both drug and its metabolite. For drug, Cmax increased from number number.number to number number unit and more importantly, AUCnumber-  was significantly increasedfrom number number to number number drug*h/drug, while the mean tnumber/number was prolonged after drug pretreatment. For number-hydroxyatomoxetine-O-glucuronide, Cmax and AUCnumber-   were decreased from number number to number number unit and from number number to number number drug*h/drug, respectively. These results demonstrated that the effect of drug on CYPnumberDnumber activity was responsible for an increased systemic exposure to drug (number.number-fold) and also for a decreased exposure to its main metabolite (number.number-fold). Additional studies are required in order to evaluate the clinical relevance of this pharmacokinetic drug interaction.This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

7586928,drug: a new drug substrate for the polymorphic CYPnumberDnumber in humans.,"The drug drug (drug) is frequently used as an drug and drug drug. However, until now there have been drug detailed data on drug metabolism in humans. We therefore investigated pathways that contribute to elimination of drug, and we tested the hypothesis that drug O-demethylation to drug (DHM) is catalyzed by the polymorphic CYPnumberDnumber. A single drug dose of drug was administered to six extensive (metabolic ratio [MR] < or = number), two intermediate (number < MR < number) and six poor metabolizers (MR > or = number) of drug/debrisoquin. Serum concentrations of drug and drug were measured up to number hours, and urinary excretion of conjugated and unconjugated drug, drug, and drug were determined. There were drug differences in the pharmacokinetics of drug between extensive and poor metabolizers. However, the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), partial metabolic clearance, and total urinary recovery of drug were significantly lower in poor metabolizers (number.number +/- number.number nmol.hr/L; number.number +/- number.number unit; number.number% +/- number.number% of dose) compared with extensive metabolizers (number.number +/- number.number nmol.hr/L; number.number +/- number.number unit; number.number% +/- number.number%; p < number.number). There was a strong correlation between the AUCDHC/AUCDHM ratio and the urinary metabolic ratio of drug (rS = number.number, p = number.number). drug significant differences between extensive and poor metabolizers were detected in urine for conjugated drug (extensive metabolizers, number.number% of dose; poor metabolizers, number.number%), unconjugated drug (extensive metabolizers, number.number%; poor metabolizers, number.number%), conjugated drug (extensive metabolizers, number.number%; poor metabolizers, number.number%), or unconjugated drug (extensive metabolizers, number.number%; poor metabolizers, number.number%). drug O-demethylation to drug is impaired in poor metabolizers of drug. The main urinary metabolites after administration of drug are the parent drug and its conjugates in extensive and poor metabolizers.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,METHODS Study popuZution Fourteen healthy volunteers participated trial Group consisted six extensive metabolizers group two intermediate metabolizers group six poor metabolizers drug debrisoquin Groups matched sex age weight CYPnumberDnumber phenotype evaluated use single drug dose drug drug drug l  subjects classified according urinary metabolic ratio MR drug numberand number dehydrometabolites shows clear trimodal distribution following groupsl  l MR extensive metabolizer l  MR  intermediate metabolizer l MR I poor metabolizer In addition phenotyping Xba I restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP polymerase chain reaction PCR used genotyping deoxyribonucleic drug peripheral leukocytes volunteers PCR procedures performed detect A B C D E F J mutations CYPnumberDnumber gene numbero number The characteristics volunteers shown Table I The study protocol approved ethics committee Robert Bosch Hospital Stuttgart Germany Before study participants informed physician aim course possible risks study written informed consent obtained A detailed physical examination laboratory tests performed completion study Study design A single drug dose drug drug hydrogentartrate Paracodin administered volunteers fasted overnight drug samples wer obtained first dose l number l numberl number numberl number hours Urine collected hours Urine serum samples stored number  C analysis Analytic methods determination drug drug metabolites drug drug serum determined gas chromatography drug mass spectrometry GS MS MS number In brief drug drug drug drug added internal standards drug serum After pH adjusted serum samples extracted drug vol vol mixture drug number propanol The organic phase evaporated dryness gentle stream nitrogen pentafluoropropionyl derivatives prepared treatment l rl pentafluoropropionyl drug minutes number  C The derivatizing reagent removed nitrogen residue dissolved drug Aliquots injected GC MS MS system consisted II gas chromatograph Hewlett Packard Waldbronn Germany TSQ mass spectrometer Finnigan MAT Bremen Germany The limits quantification rig drug serum drug drug drug serum drug Quality control samples drug rig drug drug rig drug routinely assayed intraassay coefficient variation less interassay coefficient variation less drug drug urine determined dilution drug described The total amounts drug unconjugated conjugated drug measured dilution l l urine drug drug hydrolysis p l hydrochloric drug number  C minutes drug bitartrate obtained Merck Darmstadt Germany drug hydrochloride drug hydrochloride gifts Mundipharma Limburg Ger v Pharmacokinetic evaluation The drug serum concentration C time C obtained visual inspection serum concentrationtime curves drug drug The area serum concentration time curves AUC drug AUC drug AUC nM calculated trapezoidal rule segment infinity determined last concentration measured divided elimination rate constant Elimination half life estimated linear regression log transformed serum concentrations terminal elimination phase Apparent drug clearance CL drug obtained following equation CLral  Dose AUC Partial metabolic clearance CL drug calculated following Ae total amount conjugated unconjugated drug excreted urine hours drug clearance CL drug derived equation Statistical analysis All data presented mean  SD Pharmacokinetic parameters extensive poor metabolizers compared MannWhitney U test A Spearman rank correlation calculated urinary metabolic ratio drug AUC nc AUC ratio urinary metabolic ratio drug Ae Ae respectively p Values considered statistically significant

27154174,"A clinical drug-drug interaction study to evaluate the effect of a drug-pump inhibitor, a combined P-glycoprotein/drug number enzyme (CYP)numberAnumber inhibitor, and a CYPnumberCnumber inhibitor on the pharmacokinetics of drug.","The drug pathway inhibitor drug exhibits pH-dependent solubility, and in vitro studies have shown that drug is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is metabolized by drug Pnumber (CYP) numberCnumber and numberAnumber. The objective of this four-arm parallel study in healthy subjects was to evaluate the effect of the drug-pump inhibitor drug, the P-gp/drug inhibitor drug, and the CYPnumberCnumber and numberAnumber inhibitor drug on drug steady-state pharmacokinetics. Cohorts included a control arm (n = number), in which drug number drug was administered once daily (QD) for number days, and number arms in which drug was co-administered QD for number days with drug number drug (including a number-day lead-in; n = number); drug number drug (n = number); or drug number drug (n = number). Area under the drug concentration-time curve from zero to number h (AUCnumber-numberh) at steady state was lower with concomitant drug administration relative to drug alone [geometric mean ratio (GMR), number.number (associated number % confidence interval [drug], number.number, number.number)]. There was drug effect of drug on steady-state exposure of drug [GMR, number.number (number % drug number.number, number.number)]. Co-administration with drug increased drug steady-state AUCnumber-numberh [GMR, number.number (number % drug number.number, number.number)]. Co-administration of drug, drug, and drug had similar effects on the exposure of unbound drug and total drug. The results of this study suggest that drug can be administered with drug-reducing agents and P-gp and CYP inhibitors without the risk of a clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction.

23520311,drug increases linezolid exposure in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients.,"The use of linezolid for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is limited by dose- and time-dependent toxicity. Recently, we reported a case of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between linezolid and drug that resulted in increased linezolid exposure. The aim of this prospective pharmacokinetic study is to quantify the effect of drug on the exposure of linezolid. Subjects were included in an open-label, single-centre, single-arm, fixed-order pharmacokinetic interaction study. All subjects received number drug linezolid twice daily during the entire study, consecutively co-administered with number drug and number drug drug once daily. Steady-state serum curves of linezolid and drug were analysed using validated methods, and differences between pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Linezolid exposure increased by a median (interquartile range) of number% (number-number%, p=number.number) after co-administration of number drug drug (n=number) compared to baseline, whereas number drug drug had drug statistically significant effect. Co-administration was well tolerated by most patients; none experienced severe adverse effects. One patient reported common toxicity criteria grade number gastrointestinal adverse events. In this study, we showed that drug significantly increased linezolid serum exposure after combining drug with linezolid in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients. The drug-drug interaction is possibly P-glycoprotein-mediated. Due to large interpatient variability, therapeutic drug monitoring is advisable to determine individual effect size.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,Method

Pharmacokinetic parameters on day number and at steady-state were compared with elimination phenotype and single-nucleotide polymorphisms of CYPnumberAnumber and ABCBnumber. A fivefold variation in estimated drug clearance (CL/F) was present on day number and mean CL/F had fallen by number% at steady state. This reduction in drug CL/F was associated with ABCBnumber genotype, being least apparent in thymidine homozygotes at the numberT>C, numberG>T/A and numberC>T loci. Toxicity-related dose reduction also tended to be less common in these individuals.

Statistical considerations. The primary objective of this study was
to evaluate the relationships between ABCBnumber genotype and drug
CL/F. A priori, it was estimated that a sample size of number patients
would be sufficient to detect a correlation with number% confidence and
number% power for a single SNP.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v number.number (SPSS,
Chicago, IL). Significance level was set at number% and two-sided tests
were used throughout. Day number and steady-state measures were
compared by paired t-test. The Spearman s rank correlation was
used to quantify the association between continuous variables. The
Jonckheere-Terpstra non-parametric test was used to test for an
association between ABCBnumber and CYPnumberAnumber genotypes and clearance
parameters with heterozygotes arranged as the middle group.
drug clearance in subjects with GIST or CML was compared
by Mann Whitney test. Logistic regression was used to determine
the relationship between genotype and dose reduction. Repeated
measure analysis of variance was used to investigate the relationship
between within-patient change from day number to steady state and the
presence of TT genotypes at the three ABCBnumber loci examined. Odds
ratios were used to quantify the degree of association between TT
genotype and dose reduction. All analyses were exploratory and
therefore no adjustments for multiple comparisons have been made."
23325481,Effect of concomitant administration of drug chloride extended release on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy adults.,"Overactive bladder (OAB) is often associated with a number of co-morbid medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus.

However, coadministration with another renally eliminated drug (e.g., drug) may theoretically result in a drug. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (drug and urine) and safety/tolerability of the coadministration of drug chloride extended release (XR) and drug under steady-state conditions in healthy male and female subjects.

9010701,"drug and drug in extensive and poor metabolizers of drug: pharmacokinetics, drug effect and side effects.","drug O-demethylation to drug is catalysed by the genetic polymorphic drug oxygenase (CYPnumberDnumber). The objective of the present study was to assess the drug effect of drug on different types of experimental pain in relation to drug phenotype. Fourteen extensive (EMs) and number poor metabolizers (PMs) of drug completed a randomized, double-blind, three-way, cross-drug study with a single drug dose of drug (number or number drug) against drug (number or number drug) and placebo. Pain tests performed before and number, number, number, and number h after drug included the cold pressor test and pain thresholds for heat and pressure stimulation. Adverse effects were rated by a structured interview. After drug, drug and drug-number-glucuronide were present in equal amounts in drug of PMs and EMs. After drug, neither drug nor drug-number-glucuronide could be detected in number of the number PMs, whereas at least one of the compounds could be detected in all EMs. Peak pain and discomfort rated on a VAS scale during the cold pressor test were significantly reduced by drug in both EMs and PMs, with a median peak change of number.number and number.number mm, respectively, for peak pain, and number.number and number.number mm, respectively, for discomfort. drug only reduced these pain measures significantly in EMs, with a median peak change of number.number mm for peak pain and number.number mm for discomfort. Pain detection and tolerance thresholds to heat and pressure were not consistently altered by either drug or drug. In PMs, adverse effects were significantly more pronounced on drug than on drug and only showed a slight difference between drug and placebo. In EMs, there was drug difference between drug and drug and more pronounced adverse effects on both drug as compared to placebo. This study confirms that drug O-demethylation depends on CYPnumberDnumber; it shows that the number-glucuronidation of drug is independent of CYPnumberDnumber; it supports the theory that the drug effect of drug depends on its O-demethylation; and it indicates that this is probably also the case for the adverse effects. The results lend drug support to the suggestion of a drug-drug drug effect of drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,Subjects

11929404,Comparison of drug and drug for drug drug inhibition during the daytime and night-time in different CYPnumberCnumber genotype groups.,"The drug inhibitory effect of drug depends on the S-mephenytoin number'-hydroxylase (CYPnumberCnumber) genotype status. The effect of drug is independent of this genotype. To investigate the drug inhibitory effects of drug vs. drug during the daytime and night-time with reference to different CYPnumberCnumber genotypes. Fifteen healthy volunteers were given number drug drug twice a day or number drug drug once a day for number days. On post-dose day number, number-h intragastric pH monitoring was performed. During the daytime, the intragastric pH with drug was significantly higher than that with drug in the heterozygous extensive metabolizer group, whereas drug significant difference was observed in the homozygous extensive metabolizer group. During the night-time, the intragastric pH with drug was quite similar to that with drug in the heterozygous extensive metabolizer and poor metabolizer groups. However, during the night-time, the intragastric pH with drug was significantly higher than that with drug in the homozygous extensive metabolizer group. An insufficient drug inhibition by drug during the night-time in the homozygous extensive metabolizer group could be compensated for by drug.

24602137,"Effects of drug, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in healthy volunteers.","drug is a third generation P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor currently under development. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of a single dose of drug on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drug, a P-gp substrate, and to compare them with those of drug. Eighteen healthy male subjects were administered drug alone (period number) or with drug plus drug or drug in period number or number, respectively. In period number, subjects randomly received one of three drug doses: number, number or number_mg. Changes in pupil size, alertness, drug saturation and the drug bioavailability of drug were assessed in each period. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of drug were determined. Pupil size, alertness and drug saturation did not change drug time when drug alone or drug plus drug was administered while drug significantly increased the systemic exposure to drug, i.e. the geometric mean ratio (number% confidence interval) of AUC(number,tlast ) for drug with and without drug was number.number (number.number, number.number). Co-administered drug significantly increased the systemic exposure to drug number.number-fold (number.number, number.number), which also markedly reduced pupil size, resulting in a decrease of number.number_mm_h in the area under the effect curve of pupil size change from baseline compared with drug alone. drug inhibits P-gp mainly in the intestinal endothelium, which can be beneficial because pan-inhibition of P-gp, particularly in the brain, could lead to detrimental adverse events.

19094160,"Influence of domperidone on pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of the drug agonist drug.","drug transdermal patch is a new drug-ergolinic drug agonist developed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome. Peripheral dopaminergic side-effects of drug drug such as nausea and vomiting can be prevented by the drug drug domperidone. The study results show drug evidence for an interaction of domperidone on bioavailability and steady-state pharmacokinetics of transdermal drug. Co-administration of domperidone and drug does not require dose adjustments for drug transdermal patch. To evaluate the influence of the drug drug domperidone on steady-state pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of multiple-dose treatment of the transdermally applied drug-ergolinic drug agonist drug. Sixteen healthy male subjects (mean age number.number years) participated in a randomized, two-way crossover clinical trial. Treatment A consisted of transdermal drug patch (number drug (number h)(-number), number cm(number), total drug content number.number drug) applied daily for number days, and concomitant drug domperidone (number drug t.i.d.) for number days. For treatment B, subjects received only transdermal drug treatment (daily for number days). Pharmacokinetic variables describing systemic exposure and drug elimination of drug and metabolites, and safety and tolerability of the treatment were assessed. The primary steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters (C(max,ss) and AUC((number-number),ss)) were similar with or without co-administration of domperidone. Geometric mean ratios were close to number and respective number% confidence intervals were within the acceptance range of bioequivalence (number.number, number.number): C(max,ss) number.number (number.number, number.number) and AUC((number-number),ss) number.number (number.number, number.number). t(max,ss), t(number/number), secondary parameters calculated on days number/number after repeated patch application (C(min,ss), C(ave,ss), AUC((number-tz))) and drug elimination for unconjugated drug and its metabolites were also similar with and without comedication of domperidone. A reduction in the dopaminergic side-effect nausea was seen with domperidone comedication. drug changes of pharmacokinetic parameters describing systemic exposure and drug elimination of drug were observed when domperidone was administered concomitantly with drug. The lack of pharmacokinetic interactions indicates that a dose adjustment of drug transdermal patch is not necessary with concomitant use of domperidone.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized

23712614,Influence of CYPnumberCnumber*number on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy African-American volunteers.,"To determine the influence of the drug Pnumber (CYP) numberCnumber*number polymorphism on drug pharmacokinetics in healthy African-American volunteers. Prospective, open-label, single-dose pharmacokinetic study. University of Colorado Hospital Clinical and Translational Research Center. Healthy African-American volunteers between number and number years of age were enrolled in the study based on CYPnumberCnumber genotype: CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number (number participants), CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number (number participants), and CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number (number participant). Participants received a single number-drug dose of drug in the fasted state, followed by a number-hour pharmacokinetic study. drug concentrations of drug and its M-III (keto) and M-IV (hydroxy) metabolites were compared between participants with the CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number genotype and CYPnumberCnumber*number carriers. drug area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC)number-  and half-life (tnumber/number ) did not differ significantly between CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number and CYPnumberCnumber*number carriers (AUCnumber-  number number vs number number drug*h/drug, p=number.number, tnumber/number number.number number.number vs number.number number.number h, p=number.number). M-III and M-IV AUCnumber-number also did not differ significantly between genotype groups. However, the M-III:drug AUCnumber-number ratio was significantly lower in CYPnumberCnumber*number carriers than CYPnumberCnumber*number homozygotes (number.number number.number vs number.number number.number, p=number.number). Similarly, CYPnumberCnumber*number carriers had a significantly lower M-III:M-IV AUCnumber-number ratio than participants with the CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number genotype (number.number number.number vs number.number number.number, p=number.number). These data suggest that CYPnumberCnumber*number influences drug pharmacokinetics in vivo, particularly the AUCnumber-number ratio of M-III:parent drug, and the AUCnumber-number ratio of M-III:M-IV. Larger studies are needed to further investigate the impact of CYPnumberCnumber*number on the pharmacokinetics of CYPnumberCnumber substrates in individuals of African descent.","Clinical Trial

22900583,Pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug in healthy volunteers.,"The new drug-aggregating drug drug is bioactivated by cytochromes Pnumber (CYP) numberA and numberBnumber. drug is a potent CYPnumberA inhibitor and was shown in vitro as a CYPnumberBnumber inhibitor. The aim of this open-label cross-drug study was to assess the effect of drug on drug active metabolite (drug AM) pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. drug healthy male volunteers received number drug drug. After at least a week washout, they received number drug drug, followed by number drug drug number hr later. We used dried drug spot sampling method to monitor drug AM pharmacokinetics (C(max) , t(number/number) , t(max) , AUC(number-number hr) ) at number, number.number, number.number, number, number.number, number, number and number hr after drug administration. A 'cocktail' approach was used to measure CYPnumberBnumber, numberCnumber, numberCnumber and numberA activities. In the presence of drug, drug AM C(max)  and AUC were decreased by number% (mean ratio: number.number, drug number%: number.number-number.number, p = number.number) and number% (mean ratio: number.number, drug number%: number.number-number.number, p = number.number), respectively, while t(number/number)  and t(max)  were not affected. drug metabolic ratio (MR) dramatically decreased in presence of drug (number.number number.number versus number.number number.number) reflecting an almost complete inhibition of drug, whereas drug, drug and drug MR were not affected. These data demonstrate that drug is able to block drug drug bioactivation. This CYP-mediated drug-drug interaction might lead to a significant reduction of drug efficacy in drug-infected patients with acute coronary syndrome.","Controlled Clinical Trial ;Journal Article

20705902,The impact of drug coadministration on stereospecific drug pharmacokinetics.,"to assess the impact of drug coadministration on the stereoselective pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of drug. prospective, randomized, number-phase crossover. the University of Michigan General Clinical Research Unit and Michigan Clinical Research Unit. twelve healthy volunteers aged number to number years, male and female, receiving drug treatment with drug or drug drug. participants received single dose drug drug (number.number drug) with and without coadministration of immediate-release drug (number drug orally twice daily), in random order. drug samples were collected at number, number.number, number.number, number.number, number, number.number, number, number, number, number, number, number, and number hours post-drug dose for determination of R and S drug drug enantiomer concentrations by high pressure drug chromatography. pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were calculated for each enantiomer by noncompartmental methods and compared between study phases by analysis of variance (ANOVA) controlling for study phase order and subject, with Tukey's studentized range test post hoc. Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased significantly with drug coadministration, approximately number.number-fold and number.number-fold for the R and S enantiomers, respectively. R/S AUC ratio increased significantly, from approximately number.number to number.number. Individual increases in enantiomeric AUCs with drug coadministration ranged from number% to number% and changes in R/S ratio ranged from -number% to number%. Heart rate, P-R interval, and drug pressure were monitored and drug clinically significant changes in drug effects were noted. this study demonstrated a PK drug-drug interaction between drug and drug, with considerable interparticipant variability in drug PK parameters and magnitude of drug interaction. Stereoselectivity of drug metabolism is preserved with drug coadministration, and R/S AUC ratio generally widens. Although this drug interaction could potentially increase drug antagonism and have significant clinical effects in patients, these effects were not seen in our healthy volunteer

21545485,"Effects of the moderate drug inhibitor, drug, on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy subjects.","Available data suggest that drug dosage should not exceed number drug once daily when taken concomitantly with potent drug inhibitors, such as drug. Currently, drug information is available on whether dose adjustment is necessary when drug is administered with a moderate drug inhibitor. This study shows that adjustment of drug dose is not warranted when co-administered with a moderate drug inhibitor. To assess the effects of drug, a moderate drug inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety/tolerability of drug. In this open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study, number healthy subjects (number-number years) received single doses of drug number drug alone or with drug number drug. PK endpoints, including the area under the drug concentration-time curve from number to infinity (AUC(number, )), drug drug concentration (C(max) ), time to C(max) (t(max) ), and half-life (t(number/number) ), were assessed for number-hydroxymethyl drug (number-drug), the active moiety of drug. Concomitant administration of drug with drug increased AUC(number, ) and C(max) of number-drug by approximately number% and number%, respectively, with corresponding number% confidence intervals of (number%, number%) and (number%, number%). There was drug apparent effect of drug on number-drug t(max) or t(_) . drug was generally well tolerated regardless of drug co-administration, with drug reports of death, serious adverse events (AEs) or severe AEs.

23615868,Pharmacokinetics of coadministered drug extended release and drug dimesylate.,"In clinical practice, __-drug drug have been adjunctively administered with psychostimulants for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Two studies have examined the adjunctive use of drug extended release (GXR, drug ; Shire Development LLC, Wayne, PA, USA) with psychostimulants in children and adolescents with a suboptimal response to psychostimulant treatment. However, the potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between GXR and drug dimesylate (LDX, drug ; Shire US LLC, Wayne, PA, USA) has not been thoroughly evaluated. The primary objective of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of GXR number drug and LDX number drug given as single doses alone and in drug. This was an open-label, randomized, three-period crossover, drug study. The study was conducted in a single clinical research center. Forty-two healthy adults were randomized in this study. Subjects were administered single drug doses of GXR number drug, LDX number drug, or GXR and LDX in drug. drug samples collected predose and up to number h postdose assessed drug, LDX, and d-drug levels. Bioequivalence was defined as the number% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios of the area under the drug concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCnumber- ) and drug drug concentration (Cmax) falling within the bioequivalence reference interval (number.number-number.number). Safety measures included adverse events, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Forty subjects completed the study. Following administration of LDX alone or in drug with GXR, the statistical comparisons of the AUCnumber-  and Cmax of d-drug fell entirely within the reference interval.

22381043,Contribution of CYPnumberCnumber and drug to the formation of the active drug from the prodrug drug.,"The drug activity of drug is mediated by its active metabolite, drug, which easily penetrates the drug-brain barrier and binds to the  -drug receptor as a potent agonist. drug undergoes an extensive first-pass metabolism, which has been suggested to be mediated by drug and CYPnumberCnumber; furthermore, strong inhibition of drug and CYPnumberCnumber by drug increased exposure of drug, probably by inhibition of further metabolism. The novel CYPnumberCnumber gene variant CYPnumberCnumber*number causes ultrarapid drug metabolism, in contrast to the *number and *number variants, which result in impaired drug metabolism. Using a panel study with CYPnumberCnumber ultrarapid and poor metabolizers, a major contribution of polymorphic CYPnumberCnumber on drug metabolic elimination can be excluded. _The potent drug inhibitor drug alters the sequential metabolism of drug, substantially reducing the partial metabolic clearances of drug to drug and drug to drug, which increases the drug exposure twofold. The lowest clearance in overall drug elimination is the N-demethylation of drug to drug. Inhibition of this step leads to accumulation of the active drug. To investigate in vivo the effect of the CYPnumberCnumber genotype on the pharmacokinetics of drug and the contribution of drug and CYPnumberCnumber to the formation of drug using potent drug inhibition by drug. Fourteen healthy volunteers (seven CYPnumberCnumber poor and seven ultrarapid metabolizers) received drug orally (number_mg twice daily) for number days or placebo, together with a single drug dose of drug and drug (number_mg and number_mg, respectively). drug samples and urine were collected for number_h. Noncompartmental analysis was performed to determine pharmacokinetic parameters of drug, drug, drug and drug. drug exposure increased sevenfold and terminal elimination half-life fivefold during drug treatment, but drug significant differences were observed between the CYPnumberCnumber genotypes. During drug treatment, drug area under the concentration-time curve was on average doubled, with drug differences between CYPnumberCnumber poor metabolizers [number_h_ng_ml(-number) (number% confidence interval number-number) vs. number_h_ng_ml(-number) (number% confidence interval number-number)] and ultrarapid metabolizers [number_h_ng_ml(-number) (number% confidence interval number-number) vs. number_h_ng_ml(-number) (number% confidence interval number-number)]. The drug concentration-time curve of the secondary metabolite, drug, showed a threefold increase of time to reach maximal observed drug concentration; however, area under the concentration-time curve was not altered by drug. The sequential metabolism of drug is inhibited by the potent drug inhibitor, drug, independent of the CYPnumberCnumber genotype, with a twofold increase in the exposure of the active drug.",Journal

22382316,Influence of drug Pnumber numberCnumber gene variations on pharmacokinetic parameters of drug in Japanese patients.,"drug Pnumber (CYP)numberCnumber polymorphisms may partly explain the variability of drug concentration and adverse drug effects by altering its metabolism. To compare the genetic and clinical factors responsible for the adverse effects and efficacy of drug treatment, we investigated CYPnumberCnumber genetic polymorphisms in Japanese subjects. Variations in the CYPnumberCnumber gene in number patients treated with drug were analyzed. The dosage of drug, concentrations of (R)- and (S)-drug in whole drug, and clinical laboratory test results were used as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indices. Using genomic DNA, CYPnumberCnumber*number and *number allele frequencies were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays. The frequencies of CYPnumberCnumber PM and hetero EM (hetEM) genotypes in Japanese patients taking drug were number (number.number%) and number (number.number%), respectively. The areas under the curve (AUC) of (R)-drug were number.number and number.number _g h/L, and those of (S)-drug were number.number and number.number _g h/L for hetEM and PM, respectively. This study provided new insights regarding the contribution of CYPnumberCnumber gene variations to adverse responses to drug. Genotyping of CYPnumberCnumber*number and *number can be considerably simplified by using drug FX as a polymerase for prediction of adverse effects to drug by the PCR-RFLP method.

28776352,Role of the ABCBnumber drug Transporter Polymorphisms in the Pharmacokinetics of drug in Humans: a Preliminary Report.,"drug is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, an efflux drug transporter encoded by ABCBnumber. The objective of this study was to assess the role of ABCBnumber (c.numberC>T, c.numberG>T/A, and c.numberC>T) polymorphisms in the pharmacokinetics of drug and its active metabolite, drug carboxylate in humans. Nineteen healthy male subjects were enrolled, and their ABCBnumber polymorphisms were evaluated. After the drug administration of number drug drug, the drug concentrations of drug and drug carboxylate were measured. Pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out. Systemic exposure to drug and drug carboxylate was higher in the mutant group than in the wild-type and heterozygous groups.

21352267,Comparison of pharmacokinetic variability of drug vs. drug extended release in drug Pnumber numberDnumber extensive and poor metabolizers.,"drug and number-hydroxymethyl drug (number-drug) are equipotent active moieties of drug; number-drug is the singular active moiety of drug. The formation of number-drug from drug occurs via CYPnumberDnumber, and some subjects are poor metabolizers CYPnumberDnumber. On the other hand, the formation of number-drug from drug occurs via ubiquitous esterases. Cross-study comparisons of data from phase number studies suggest that active moiety exposures are considerably more variable following drug extended release vs. drug. This head-to-head study confirmed the findings of reduced pharmacokinetic variability of drug and further delineates that drug, and not number-drug, was the principal source of variability after administration of drug extended release. The data suggest that drug delivers number-drug consistently, regardless of CYPnumberDnumber status, with up to number% higher bioavailability compared with drug. drug and number-hydroxymethyl drug (number-drug) are equipotent active moieties of drug; number-drug is the singular active moiety of drug. Formation of number-drug from drug and drug occurs via esterases and CYPnumberDnumber respectively. This randomized, crossover, open-label, multiple-dose study in CYPnumberDnumber extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) compared the pharmacokinetics of drug vs. drug extended release (ER). Subjects received drug and drug ER with a  number-day washout period. Treatment comprised number-drug once daily doses for number days escalated to number-drug once daily for number days. Pharmacokinetics of active moieties were compared by drug, dose and genotype. Active moiety exposures following drug and drug ER increased proportional to dose in EMs and PMs. In EMs only, coefficients of variation for AUC and C(max) following drug (up to number% and number% respectively) were lower than those following drug ER (up to number% and number% respectively). Following drug and drug ER administration, active moiety exposures ranged up to sevenfold and number-fold respectively. Mean urinary excretion of number-drug following drug number and number drug, respectively, was number.number and number.number drug in EMs and number.number and number.number drug in PMs. Following drug ER number and number drug, it was number.number and number.number drug respectively (EMs only). drug clearance was similar regardless of administered drug, dose or genotype. drug, not number-drug, was the principal source of variability after drug ER administration. drug delivers number-drug with less variability than drug, regardless of CYPnumberDnumber status, with up to number% higher bioavailability.

12132671,Optimal dose of drug for CYPnumberCnumber extensive metabolizers in drug-Helicobacter pylori therapy: pharmacokinetic considerations.,"In drug-Helicobacter pylori therapy using drug and drug, the efficacy can be related to the CYPnumberCnumber genotype groups; the eradication rates were number% in extensive metabolizers and number% in poor metabolizers. The present study was undertaken to help predict the optimal dosage of drug for extensive metabolizers in this therapy. Seven healthy Japanese subjects, classified based on the CYPnumberCnumber genotype into extensive metabolizers (n=number) and poor metabolizers (n=number), participated in this study. Each subject received a single drug dose of drug number, number, and number drug, with at least a number-week washout period between each dose. drug concentrations of drug and its two metabolites were monitored for number h after each dose of drug. After each dose was administered, the pharmacokinetic profiles of drug and its two metabolites were significantly different between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers. The area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) of drug in extensive metabolizers was disproportionally increased number.number- or number.number-fold with dose escalation from number to number or number drug drug, respectively. In contrast, the AUC of drug was proportionally increased with the higher dose in poor metabolizers. The AUC of drug after number drug administration to poor metabolizers was almost equal to the AUC in extensive metabolizers after number drug administration. In drug-H. pylori therapy, the recommended dose of drug for extensive metabolizers is suggested to be a drug of number drug x number/d based on pharmacokinetic considerations.",Journal Article,None,MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals drug two metabolites number drug drug drug obtained July Notes Biol Pharm Bull number number _ To correspondence addressed e mail okumurak kobe u ac jp  drug Society Japan Optimal Dose drug CYPnumberCnumber Extensive Metabolizers drug Helicobacter pylori Therapy Pharmacokinetic Considerations Tomoko KITA Toshiyuki SAKAEDA Nobuo AOYAMA b Toshiyuki SAKAI c Yuko KAWAHARA Masato KASUGA c Katsuhiko OKUMURA a Department Hospital Pharmacy School Medicine Kobe University b Department Endoscopy School Medicine Kobe University c Division Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases Department Clinical Molecular Medicine Graduate School Medicine Kobe University Chuo ku Kobe number number Japan Received January accepted April In drug Helicobacter pylori therapy using drug drug efficacy related CYPnumberCnumber genotype groups eradication rates extensive metabolizers poor metabolizers The present study undertaken help predict optimal dosage drug extensive metabolizers therapy Seven healthy Japanese subjects classified based CYPnumberCnumber genotype extensive metabolizers nnumber poor metabolizers nnumber participated study Each subject received single drug dose drug drug least number week washout period dose drug concentrations drug two metabolites monitored h dose drug After dose administered pharmacokinetic profiles drug two metabolites significantly different extensive metabolizers poor metabolizers The area drug concentration time curve AUC drug extensive metabolizers disproportionally increased number numberor number number fold dose escalation drug drug respectively In contrast AUC drug proportionally increased higher dose poor metabolizers The AUC drug drug administration poor metabolizers almost equal AUC extensive metabolizers drug administration In drug H pylori therapy recommended dose drug extensive metabolizers suggested drug mgnumber d based pharmacokinetic considerations Key words CYPnumberCnumber genotype nonlinear kinetics drug Fig Metabolic Pathways drug The thickness arrows indicates approximate contribution CYP isoforms metabolic pathways AstraZeneca Ltd London U K All chemicals reagent grade obtained commercially Subjects Seven unrelated H pylori negative males agreed participate study The CYPnumberCnumber genotype determined using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR RFLP number number They classified two groups subjects extensive metabolizers CYPnumberCnumber number CYPnumberCnumber number remaining subjects poor metabolizers CYPnumberCnumber number CYPnumberCnumber number nnumber CYPnumberCnumber number CYPnumberCnumber number nnumber The demographics age weight extensive metabolizers poor metabolizers different years meannumberS D kg respectively None subjects hepatic drug dysfunction taken drug including drug drug the counter drug least week study Written informed consent obtained subjects study commenced The protocol study approved advance Institutional Review Board Kobe University School Medicine Kobe Japan Study Protocol Each subject received single drug dose drug Omepral tablet AstraZeneca Ltd drug least number week washout period dose Each dose taken h breakfast lunch served h drug ingestion Venous drug samples collected prior h taking drug drug samples separated centrifugation numberg min stored C analysis It confirmed alteration concentrations drug two metabolites storage Concentration Measurements drug concentrations drug two metabolites number drug drug drug measured described previously number number Briefly drug drug phenacetin drug drug internal standard drug drug etherdichloromethane  v v added drug drug sample They extracted twice shaking min mixture centrifuged numberg min Then drug propylene glycol added supernatant solvent evaporated nitrogen stream C The residue dissolved drug mobile phase filtered using number number mm filter HPLC Sample Prep LCRnumber LG Nihon Millipore Ltd Tokyo Japan Fifty microliter aliquots injected HPLC system Pharmacokinetic Analysis The drug drug concentration Cmax obtained graphically The areas drug concentration time curve AUC drug two metabolites calculated using linear trapezoidal rule h According rational pharmacokinetic notation AUC number drug drug drug depended drug AUC metabolite corrected dividing drug consider metabolic processes appropriately Statistical Analysis Equivalence variance tested using F test Statistical comparisons performed using unpaired t test p values less considered significant

18294333,Increased drug metabolism in carriers of the CYPnumberCnumber*number allele; a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers.,"The only existing study of CYPnumberCnumber*number-associated alterations in drug pharmacokinetics was retrospective and compared probe drug metabolic ratios. The CYPnumberCnumber*number allele had been associated with a two- and fourfold decrease in drug and S/R-mephenytoin metabolic ratios. This study characterized the single-dose pharmacokinetics of drug, along with the number-hydroxy and drug metabolites, in CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number and CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number subjects. The observed differences in drug AUC(infinity) suggest that the CYPnumberCnumber*number allele is an important explanatory factor behind individual cases of therapeutic failure. AIMS To investigate the influence of the CYPnumberCnumber*number allele on the pharmacokinetics of drug, a commonly used CYPnumberCnumber probe drug, in healthy volunteers. In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study, number healthy White volunteers genotyped as either CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number or CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number received an drug dose of number drug of drug. drug was sampled for up to number h postdose, followed by quantification of drug, number-hydroxy drug and drug drug by high-performance drug chromatography. The mean drug AUC(infinity) of number h nmol l(-number) in CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number subjects was number.number-fold lower [number% confidence interval (drug) number.number, number.number] than in CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number subjects (number h nmol l(-number), P = number.number). A similar trend was observed for the drug metabolite with the CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number group having a mean AUC(infinity) of number h nmol l(-number), number.number-fold lower (number% drug number.number, number.number) than the CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number group (number h nmol l(-number), P = number.number). A pronounced correlation (r(number) = number.number, P < number.number) was seen in the intraindividual drug AUC(infinity) and drug drug AUC(infinity) values. The pharmacokinetics of drug and drug drug differ significantly between homozygous CYPnumberCnumber*number and CYPnumberCnumber*number subjects. For clinically important drug that are metabolized predominantly by CYPnumberCnumber, the CYPnumberCnumber*number allele might be associated with subtherapeutic drug exposure.","Journal Article

20078609,The effects of drug on drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy subjects.,"* drug-A receptor antagonists (ETRAs) and drug-type number inhibitors are approved monotherapies for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension; combining agents from these two drug classes could be beneficial. * There is a significant pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between the ETRA drug and the drug-type number inhibitor drug. * This study assessed whether the ETRA drug similarly impacts the PK of drug. * This study demonstrates that drug has little effect on drug PK and pharmacodynamics and that drug dose adjustment of either drug is required upon co-administration of drug with drug. This study evaluated the effects of drug on the pharmacodynamic [systemic drug pressure (BP)] and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of drug in healthy volunteers. Healthy subjects (number-number years, n= number) were randomized into two sequence groups. Group number received drug drug number drug daily (number days), followed by placebo (number days). Group number received placebo (number days), followed by drug drug number drug (number days). On day number of each treatment period, participants received drug number drug. PK parameters and BP were analysed on day number in each treatment period. drug exposure was slightly higher [AUC(infinity) geometric mean ratio (GMR), number%] when co-administered with drug number drug vs. placebo, demonstrating a weak, but statistically significant interaction (number% confidence interval number.number%, number.number%).

18492125,A pharmacokinetic study of drug (TMCnumber) co-administered with drug and drug in drug-negative volunteers.,"drug is a next-generation drug-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) with activity against wild-type and NNRTI-resistant drug. drug pump inhibitors and H(number)-antagonists are frequently used in the drug-negative-infected population, and drug-drug interactions have been described with other antiretrovirals. This study evaluated the effect of steady-state drug and drug on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of drug. In an open-label, randomized, one-way, three-period crossover trial, drug-negative volunteers randomly received a single dose of number drug drug alone (treatment A); number days of number drug drug b.i.d. (treatment B); and number days of number drug drug q.d. (treatment C). A single dose of number drug drug was co-administered on day number of sessions number and number. Each session was separated by a number-day wash-out. Nineteen volunteers (seven female) participated. When a single dose of drug was administered in the presence of steady-state drug, drug least squares means ratios (number% confidence interval) for AUC(last) and C(max) were number.number (number.number, number.number) and number.number (number.number, number.number), respectively, compared with administration of drug alone. When administered with steady-state drug, these values were number.number (number.number, number.number) and number.number (number.number, number.number), respectively. Co-administration of a single dose of drug and drug or drug was generally safe and well tolerated. drug slightly decreased drug exposure, whereas drug increased it by approximately number%. The increased exposure of drug when co-administered with drug is attributed to CYPnumberCnumber inhibition. Considering the favourable safety profile of drug, these changes are not clinically relevant. drug can be co-administered with drug pump inhibitors and H(number) antagonists without dose adjustments.",Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,PMC2561103,Methods The final protocol reviewed approved Independent Ethics Committee according specifications outlined applicable regulations

21171670,Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic interaction between drug (drug) and drug in healthy subjects.,"Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) have been identified as a primary cause of reflux events in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). drug(B) receptor drug such as drug (drug) have been shown to inhibit TLESRs in healthy subjects and patients with GERD, and, therefore, offer a novel therapeutic add-on strategy to drug suppression for the management of GERD. As drug is being developed as an add-on treatment for the management of patients with GERD who have a partial response to drug pump inhibitor (drug) therapy, it is important to rule out any clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between drug and PPIs. To evaluate the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics and safety of drug and vice versa. This was an open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study. The study was open to healthy adult male and female subjects. The study subjects received treatment with, in random order, drug (number_mg twice daily [dose interval number hours]), drug (number_mg once daily), and a drug of both, during number-day treatment periods. The presence or absence of pharmacokinetic interactions between drug and drug was assessed by measuring the steady-state area under the drug concentration-time curves during the dosing interval (AUC(_)) and the drug observed drug concentration (C(max)) for drug and drug. Thirty male subjects (mean age number.number years, number% Caucasian) were randomized to treatment and number subjects completed the study (one subject was lost to follow-up, and one subject discontinued due to an adverse event). The number% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios for AUC(_) and C(max) of drug and drug administered alone and concomitantly were within the recognized boundaries of bioequivalence (number.number-number.number). drug new safety concerns were raised during this study. The number of patients with adverse events during treatment with drug alone (n_=_number) and concomitantly with drug (n_=_number) were comparable but higher than with drug alone (n_=_number). Paresthesia (episodic, mild, and transient), pharyngitis, and flatulence were the most frequently reported adverse events. There was drug observed pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug when concomitantly administered to healthy subjects, and concomitant therapy was well tolerated.

The effects of CYPnumberDnumber unit CYPnumberA activity modulation on the pharmacokinetics of drug remains poorly explored. A randomized crossover double-blind placebo-drug study was performed with number healthy volunteers genotyped for CYPnumberDnumber [six extensive (EM), two deficient (PM/IM) and two ultrarapid metabolizers (UM)]. The volunteers randomly received on five different occasions: drug number.number drug x kg(-number) and placebo; drug and drug (CYPnumberDnumber inhibitor); drug and drug (CYPnumberA inhibitor); drug and drug+drug; placebo. drug samples for drug concentrations of drug and metabolites (drug, drug and drug) were collected for number h after dosing. Phenotyping for CYPnumberDnumber (with drug) and CYPnumberA (with drug) were assessed at each session. CYPnumberDnumber activity was correlated with drug and drug AUCs and C(max) (-number.number < Spearman correlation coefficient rhos < -number.number). drug C(max) was number% and number% lower in PM than EM and UM. drug C(max) reduction was even more pronounced (number%). In UM, drug and drug concentrations increased whereas drug exposure was halved. Blocking CYPnumberDnumber (with drug) reduced drug and drug C(max) by number% and number%, and increased drug AUC(infinity) by number%. Blocking drug (with drug) tripled drug AUC(infinity) and reduced drug and drug AUCs by number%.

17635496,drug significant effect of SLCOnumberBnumber polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of drug and drug.,"To examine possible effects of polymorphism in the SLCOnumberBnumber gene, encoding the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) numberBnumber, on the pharmacokinetics of drug and drug in a prospective genotype panel study. Sixteen healthy volunteers with the homozygous SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberTT genotype (controls), number with the heterozygous c.numberTC genotype and four with the homozygous c.numberCC genotype ingested a single number-drug dose of drug and a single number-drug dose of drug in a cross-drug study with a wash-out period of at least number week. SLCOnumberBnumber polymorphism had drug statistically significant effect on any of the pharmacokinetic variables of drug, drug or their metabolites. The mean +/- SD area under the drug drug concentration-time curve from time number to infinity (AUC(number-infinity)) was number +/- number drug drug(-number) h in the c.numberTT subjects, number +/- number drug drug(-number) h in the c.numberTC subjects (geometric mean ratio c.numberTC/c.numberTT number.number; number% confidence interval number.number, number.number) and number +/- number drug drug(-number) h in the c.numberCC subjects (c.numberCC/c.numberTT number.number; number.number, number.number). The AUC(number-infinity) of drug averaged number +/- number drug drug(-number) h in the c.numberTT subjects, number +/- number drug drug(-number) h in the c.numberTC subjects (c.numberTC/c.numberTT number.number; number.number, number.number) and number +/- number drug drug(-number) h in the c.numberCC subjects (c.numberCC/c.numberTT number.number; number.number, number.number). There was a significant correlation between the AUC(number-infinity) of drug and drug (r = number.number, P < number.number). The SLCOnumberBnumber c.numberT-->C SNP does not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug or drug, indicating that OATPnumberBnumber plays drug significant role in the disposition of these drug.","Clinical

10208643,The stereoselective metabolism of drug in poor and extensive metabolizers of drug.,"The drug serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug is administered as a racemic mixture, and R- and S-drug are metabolized in the drug by N-demethylation to R- and S-drug, respectively. R- and S-drug and S-drug are equally potent drug serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but R-drug is number-fold less potent in this regard. Racemic drug and drug are potent inhibitors of drug Pnumber (CYP) numberDnumber in vivo and in vitro and recent studies in vivo have shown that racemic drug is metabolized by CYPnumberDnumber. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the stereoselective metabolism of drug and drug by CYPnumberDnumber in vivo. A single drug dose of drug (number drug) was administered to six poor and six extensive metabolizers of drug. drug samples were collected during number weeks for poor metabolizers and number weeks for extensive metabolizers. Once a week a drug test was performed. The R- and S-enantiomers of drug and drug were determined by a stereoselective gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy method. In the poor metabolizers, the drug clearance of R- and S-drug was number.number unit and number unit respectively, the corresponding values in the extensive metabolizers were number unit and number unit respectively. For both enantiomers, the phenotype difference was statistically significant. In poor metabolizers, the elimination half-lives were number.number days and number.number days for R- and S-drug, respectively, and in the extensive metabolizers it was number.number days for both enantiomers, a significant phenotypical difference only for S-drug. For drug the elimination half-lives were number.number and number.number days in poor metabolizers for the R- and S-enantiomer, respectively. The corresponding values in the extensive metabolizers were number.number and number.number days, respectively. Also for this parameter, the differences were statistically significant. This study shows that CYPnumberDnumber catalyses the metabolism of R- and S-drug and most likely the further metabolism of S-drug but not of R-drug.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article,None,Materials methods Study population This study designed panel study including healthy volunteers All volunteers drawn database approximately individuals phenotyped drug Six poor six extensive metabolizers drug fulfilled requirements inclusion exclusion criteria included study Persons included years age passed physical examination drug clinical chemistry haematology immunology electrocardiogram Volunteers excluded history drug disease severe allergic reactions deviated ideal weight forheight abused drug donated drug drug within last months None volunteers allowed take drug except drug drug throughout entire study period allowed drink drug day drug administration The volunteers consented participate drug written verbal information The study protocol approved regional Ethics Committee Danish National Board Health Study procedure drug Fontex Eli Lilly A S Denmark administered single drug dose drug day study period As baseline reference drug sample drawn immediately volunteer took drug O h subsequently drug sampled hand days In poor metabolizers additional drug samples drawn days The volunteers confined research facility first day drug samples drawn using indwelling intravenous catheter Venflon ii number Ohmeda Sweden possible On occasions drug drawn venous puncture The drug samples centrifuged drug stored C analysis When volunteers finished study drug samples transferred ice analytical laboratory Lausanne Switzerland Rand S drug Rand S drug assayed gas chromatography mass spectroscopy The limit quantification drug drug enantiomers drug Stereoselective metabolism drug drug drug enantiomers drug coefficients variance range Eap et al All volunteers agreed report adverse effect taking drug These reports registered case report forms During study volunteers also carried drug tests week In short volunteer selfadministered drug drug Depasannumber Giulini Pharma Germany hand collected urine next h hon day new drug test The first test performed day drug administered drug tests thus performed days volunteers additionally days poor metabolizers Urine volume measured drug specimen stored C analysis The urine analysed gas chromatography Vinks et al  Plwrmacokinetics statistics The apparent drug clearance enantiomer drug determined use trapezoidal rule calculating area curve AUC The elimination half life enantiomers drug drug determined according equation Finally AUC ratio drug drug determined enantiomer This ratio reflects relationship nf drug f drug With respect phenotype pharmacokinetic parameter compared Rand S enantiomer Wilcoxon s matched pair sign test enantiomer result extensive poor metabolizers compared Mann Whitney U test Calculations performed SPSS Windows statistical significance level Table I Calculated pharmacokinetic data racemic drug corresponding P values intake drug racemic drug six poor PM six extensive EM metabolizers drug Cleamnumberce Elinumberinumberationumber numberalf life days AUCnumber numberg numberr l Pllenumberotype S Jnumberoxetinumbere R jnumberoxetinumbere S jnumberoxetinumbere R Jnumberoxetinumbere S Jluoxetinumbere R fluoxetinumbere PMl PMnumber PMnumber PMnumber PMS PMnumber Median Wilcoxon Rversus S enantiomer P value EMl EMnumber EMnumber EMnumber number h EMS EMnumber Median number l Wilcoxon Rversus enantiomer P valuc Mann Whitney PM versus EM P values From urine data concentrations drug numberand number dehydrosparteine obtained metabolic ratio drug divided dehydrosparteines calculated Extensive metabolizers defined according metabolic ratio lower poor metabolizers according metabolic ratio greater The metabolic ratios calculated urine data compared calculating confidence limits median differences Calculations performed Medstat Herlev University Hospital

All drug metabolic ratios (PMR(number h), SMR(number h), SMR(number h), UMRnumber(number h), and UMRnumber(number h)) significantly correlated with each other (p <number.number) except for UMRnumber(number h), which did not correlate. A significant correlation (p <number.number) was also found between drug clearance and PMR(number h) (r=number.number), SMR(number h) (r=number.number), SMR(number h) (r=number.number), UMRnumber(number h) (r=number.number), and UMRnumber(number h) (r=number.number). A negative correlation was observed between drug clearance and UMRnumber(number h) (r=-number.number, p=NS). A significant correlation was found between drug clearance and drug drug metabolic ratios.

Subjects
The Mercer University Institutional Review Board approved this study and each participant provided written informed consent. In all, number healthy nonsmokers (number male, one female) participated in this study. Subjects were included in our investigation if they met the following inclusion criteria: medically healthy volunteers, men and women drug number years of age, women of childbearing potential on medically acceptable birth control excluding drug contraceptives, hormonal implants, or drug-injections. Subjects were also excluded if they met any of the following exclusion criteria: presence of any chronic medical condition, pregnancy and/or breastfeeding, history of drug, drug or drug abuse, use of any prescription or drug-the counter drug or herbal remedies metabolized by the CYP Pnumber numberAnumber system, or an inability to comply with a diet free of drug, drug, and grapefruit juice and products number_h before the overnight stay prior to the study day. The health status of our subjects was assessed by a thorough health and drug history, physical examination, and a complete metabolic and hematologic blood profile, prior to study protocol initiation.

Study Design
Subjects were asked to comply with a diet free of drug, drug, and grapefruit juice/products for number_h, and come to the Center for Clinical Research (CCR) for an overnight stay of approximately number_h prior to the initiation of the study day. The investigator confirmed compliance with the protocol-specified diet via detailed subject interviews. After eating a standardized breakfast, subjects received number_mg of drug (No-Doz ). Previously standardized procedures were used for obtaining drug; saliva and urine samples were established by previous investigators (Carrillo et al, number; Spigset, numberb). Each subject had two number_ml blood samples drawn; one sample was obtained prior to drug administration and the second sample number_h postcaffeine dosing. All samples were collected in drug vacutainer tubes and centrifuged at number_g for number_min after which drug was harvested and stored at  number C until it was analyzed for drug and drug.

Immediately after drug administration, subjects began to collect their urine and continued to do so drug the next number_h. All urine samples were measured individually for total volume and then aliqoted into smaller samples, which were subsequently acidified to a pH of number.number with number.number_M hydrochloric acid before storage at  number C (preservation of drug metabolites). At number and number_h after drug administration subjects were asked to chew on a piece of drug wax film to stimulate saliva production and a number_ml sample of saliva was collected and stored at  number C until the time of analysis.

Each of the number subjects received a single number_mg drug dose. Venous blood samples were collected for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) determination of drug concentrations at predose and at number.number, number, number.number, number, number.number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, and number_h postdose. All samples were stored at _number C until assayed. One male subject withdrew from the study for personal reasons and did not participate in drug dosing.

Analytic Methods
drug drug concentrations were assayed by Bioanalytical Services (BAS; west Lafayette, IN) by a published HPLC method developed by the drug's manufacturer (Eli Lilly drug, Indianapolis, IN) by HPLC (Catlow et al, number). drug, urine and salivary drug (numberX) metabolites (numberX, numberX, number-acetylamino-number-amino-number-methyluracil (AAMU), number-methylxanthine (numberX), number-methyl drug acid (numberU), and number,number dimethyl drug acid (numberU) were analyzed using validated HPLC methodology (El-Yazigi et al, number; Fuhr and Rost, number). CYPnumberAnumber activity was measured as drug (PMR), salivary (SMR), and urinary metabolite (UMR) to drug metabolic ratios were validated in previous phenotypic studies (Fuhr et al, number; Spigset et al, number; Carrillo et al, number).

Data and Statistical Analysis
drug pharmacokinetic parameters values for each subject were determined with the use of noncompartmental methods and are displayed in Table number. Maximal drug concentrations (Cmax) and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were determined by visual inspection of the concentration time profiles. The elimination rate constant (_z) was estimated as the absolute value of the slope of a linear regression of natural logarithm of concentration vs time. Half-life was calculated as ln_number/_z. The area under the drug concentration time curve (AUCnumber ) was determined by the linear trapezoidal rule with extrapolation to infinity (AUCnumber ) by dividing the last concentration measured by the elimination rate constant (_z). drug clearance (CL/F) was determined by dividing the dose administered by AUCnumber  and the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was calculated as the ratio of CL/F to _z. The number% confidence intervals (CIs) for the differences in means for the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameter values were transformed back to the original scale to give number% CIs for the geometric means.

17148773,CYPnumberA phenotyping approach to predict systemic exposure to EGFR drug kinase inhibitors.,"drug is an orally active inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drug kinase (TK) with activity in drug-small-cell lung cancer. The response to drug is variable, possibly because of interindividual variation in the activity of drug Pnumber numberA (CYPnumberA), the principal enzyme that metabolizes drug. We prospectively assessed the influence of CYPnumberA activity on drug disposition and toxicity. Twenty-seven patients with advanced cancer were treated with daily drug drug at number drug (n = number) or number drug (n = number) for number days. Concentration-time profiles of drug and geftinib were constructed based on measurement of their concentration in serial drug samples using high-performance drug chromatography and mass spectroscopy. CYPnumberA activity was determined at baseline by assessment of drug apparent drug clearance. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed for a period of number days, and population modeling was performed using NONMEM software. A structural pharmacokinetic model was developed to describe the concentration-time profiles of unbound and total drug drug concentrations, and patient-specific covariates were added to the model to account for unexplained interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. Statistical tests were two-sided. drug pharmacokinetics exhibited wide interindividual variability (interindividual variability on total and unbound drug apparent drug clearance was number% and number%, respectively). drug clearance (mean = number unit range = number-number) was highly correlated with that of total and unbound drug (Rnumber = .number and Rnumber = .number, respectively) and with steady-state drug trough concentrations of drug (Rnumber = .number and Rnumber = .number, respectively), and it accounted for approximately number% of interindividual variability in drug clearance in the pharmacokinetic model. Both total and unbound drug steady-state drug trough concentrations were associated with the development of diarrhea (P<.number), but not skin rash. At a dose of number drug drug, number of number patients achieved steady-state drug trough concentrations above the ICnumber for inhibition of mutant EGFR in vitro (number.number microM), but only one achieved a steady-state drug trough concentration above the ICnumber for inhibition of wild-type EGFR (number.number microM). As an in vivo phenotypic probe of CYPnumberA, drug drug clearance may have utility for prediction of drug exposure and dose selection. A pharmacokinetic model incorporating this indicator of CYPnumberA activity has potential for optimization of treatment with drug and other TK inhibitors that are metabolized in a similar manner.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,P ATIENTS AND M ETHODS Study Population Treatment Patients cancer treated drug part biologic effects study evaluate

22240839,Impact of concomitant drug administration on drug drug exposure and drug bioavailability in healthy adult subjects.,"The aim of this open-label, randomized, and number-period crossover study was to evaluate the influences of concomitant drug administration on the drug disposition, intestinal drug, and urinary excretion of drug in humans. drug (number drug) was orally administered alone, with number g drug oxide (MgO), or with number drug drug to number healthy adult subjects. drug bioavailability (BA) of drug was estimated by number-h urine collection. The C(max), T(max) and AUC(number- ) of drug + MgO were significantly lower than that of drug alone (by number%, number% and number%, respectively) and drug + drug (by number%, number% and number%, respectively). In contrast, drug significant differences were observed in the drug disposition parameters of drug between the treatments with and without drug. The drug BA in the MgO treatment was significantly lower, by number% and number%, compared to the drug alone and with drug treatment, respectively. There was drug significant difference in the drug BA between the drug alone and with drug treatment. Concomitant MgO and drug did not affect the drug clearance of drug. In conclusion, concomitant MgO decreased the drug exposure through the reduction of intestinal drug extent and rate.

26773420,Cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics in children with B-cell drug-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,"Variation in cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics and metabolism has been highlighted as a factor that may impact on clinical outcome in drug tumour types. The current study in children with B-cell drug-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was designed to corroborate previous findings in a large prospective study incorporating genotype for common polymorphisms known to influence cyclophosphamide pharmacology. A total of number drug samples collected drug a number year period, from number B-cell NHL patients   number years receiving cyclophosphamide (number unit(number)), were used to characterise a population pharmacokinetic model. Polymorphisms in genes including CYPnumberBnumber and CYPnumberCnumber were analysed. A two-compartment model provided the best fit of the population analysis. The mean cyclophosphamide clearance value following dose number was significantly lower than following dose number (number.number   number.number versus number.number   number.number unit/m(number), respectively; mean   standard deviation from empirical Bayes estimates; P < number.number). The presence of at least one CYPnumberBnumber*number variant allele was associated with a lower cyclophosphamide clearance following both dose number (number.number   number.number unit/m(number) versus number.number   number.number unit/m(number), P = number.number) and dose number (number.number   number.number unit/m(number) versus number.number   number.number unit/m(number), P = number.number), as compared to homozygous wild-type patients. drug pharmacokinetic parameters investigated were shown to have a significant influence on progression free survival. The results do not support previous findings of a link between cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics or metabolism and disease recurrence in childhood B-cell NHL. While CYPnumberBnumber genotype was shown to influence pharmacokinetics, there was drug clear impact on clinical outcome.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Multicenter Study ;Research Support,

26991517,Therapeutic protein-drug interaction assessment for daclizumab high-yield process in patients with multiple sclerosis using a cocktail approach.,"To characterize the potential effect of daclizumab high-yield process (DAC HYP), a monoclonal antibody that blocks the high-affinity interleukin-number receptors for treatment of multiple sclerosis, on activity of drug Pnumber (CYP) drug. Twenty patients with multiple sclerosis received an drug cocktail of probe substrates of CYPnumberAnumber (drug number drug), CYPnumberCnumber (drug number unit K number drug), CYPnumberCnumber (drug number drug), CYPnumberDnumber (drug number drug) and CYPnumberA (drug number drug) on two sequential occasions: number days before and number days after subcutaneous administration of DAC HYP number drug every number weeks for three doses. Serial pharmacokinetic drug samples up to number h post dose and number-h urine samples were collected on both occasions. Area under the curve (AUC) for drug, S-drug, drug and drug, and urine drug to drug ratio were calculated. Statistical analyses were conducted on log-transformed parameters using a linear mixed-effects model. The number% confidence intervals (CIs) for the geometric mean ratio (probe substrate with DAC HYP/probe substrate alone) for drug AUC from number-number h (number.number-number.number), S-drug AUC from number to infinity (AUC[number-drug]) (number.number-number.number), drug AUC(number-drug) (number.number-number.number) and drug AUC(number-drug) (number.number-number.number) were within the drug-effect boundary of number.number-number.number. The geometric mean ratio for urine drug to drug ratio was number.number, with the number% drug (number.number-number.number) extending slightly outside the drug-effect boundary, likely due to high variability with urine collections and CYPnumberDnumber activity.

26974526,The Effect of drug on the Pharmacokinetics of drug in Healthy Subjects.,"drug is an drug strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) licensed for use in drug-number infection and is an inhibitor of organic cation transporter number (OCTnumber). This study assessed the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug, an OCTnumber substrate. This was an open-label, parallel-group, number-period crossover study in healthy adult subjects. Subjects were enrolled into number of number treatment cohorts (number unit) receiving drug number drug qnumberh for number days in period number; drug number drug qnumberh plus drug number drug qnumberh (cohort number) or number drug qnumberh (cohort number) for number days in period number; and drug number drug qnumberh for number days in period number. There were drug washout periods between treatments. Effects of drug on drug transport and paracellular permeability were evaluated in vitro. Co-administration of drug number drug qnumberh increased drug area under the curve(number-_) by number% and Cmax by number%, whereas drug number drug qnumberh increased drug area under the curve(number-_) and Cmax by number% and number%, respectively. drug t(number/number) remained unchanged. Increased drug exposure during drug co-administration returned to period number levels after drug discontinuation in period number. Co-administration of drug and drug was well tolerated. In vitro, drug was not a clinically relevant inhibitor of OCTnumber, OCTnumber, multidrug and drug extrusion protein number, multidrug and drug extrusion protein number-K, or drug membrane monoamine transporter, and it did not affect drug paracellular permeability or uptake into an intestinal cell line. drug significantly increased drug drug exposure, which can be partially explained by OCTnumber inhibition. It is recommended that dose adjustments of drug be considered to maintain optimal glycemic control when patients are starting/drug drug while taking drug.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal Article

25913040,drug relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug in drug transplant patients: a randomized crossover study.,"drug drug (MPA) suppresses lymphocyte proliferation through inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibition. Two formulations have been approved: drug mofetil (drug) and enteric-coated drug drug (EC-MPS). drug (PAN) inhibits drug drug secretion, which may alter MPA exposure. Data from healthy volunteers suggest a significant drug-drug interaction (DDA) between drug and MPA. In transplant patients, a decreased MPA area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) may lead to higher IMPDH activity, which may lead to higher acute rejection risk. Therefore this DDA was evaluated in drug transplant patients under maintenance drug therapy. In this single-centre, open, randomized, four-sequence, four-treatment crossover study, the influence of PAN number_mg on MPA pharmacokinetics such as (dose-adjusted) AUCnumber-number_h (dAUC) was analysed in number drug transplant patients (>number_months post-transplantation) receiving drug (number-number_g day(-number) ) and EC-MPS in drug with ciclosporin. The major metabolite MPA glucuronide (MPAG) and the IMPDH activity were also examined. MMF_+_PAN intake led to a lowest mean dAUC for MPA of number.number_ng h drug(-number) drug(-number) [number% confidence interval (drug) number.number, number.number], while MPA exposure was highest for EC-MPS_+_PAN [dAUC: number.number_ng h drug(-number) drug(-number) (number% drug number.number, number.number)].

Thirty healthy volunteers were administered the Cooperstown cocktail (CYPnumberAnumber [drug number drug], CYPnumberDnumber [drug number drug], CYPnumberCnumber [drug number drug], and CYPnumberA [drug number.number unit substrates) or Cooperstown cocktail + drug LDX number drug. drug samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-dose and serially for number h post-dose. Treatment differences in the primary endpoints, drug drug concentration (C max) and area under the drug concentration versus time curve from number to infinity (AUCnumber- ), were assessed using geometric mean ratios with number % CIs. Geometric least squares (LS) means (without versus with LDX) for C max (drug/drug) were number versus number for drug, number.number versus number.number for drug, number.number versus number.number for drug, and number.number versus number.number for drug; and for AUCnumber-  (drug   h/drug) were number,number versus number,number for drug, number.number versus number.number for drug, number.number versus number.number for drug, and number versus number for drug. Geometric LS mean ratios were within the standard bioequivalence testing range, except for drug and drug C max. Parent/metabolite C max and AUCnumber-  ratios were similar between treatments except for drug/drug AUCnumber-  ratio, which was lower with LDX. drug serious or severe treatment-emergent adverse events were reported. LDX did not alter CYPnumberAnumber, CYPnumberDnumber, or CYPnumberA activity.

30212395,Effect of Hormonal Contraception on Pharmacokinetics of Vaginal drug in Healthy Women: Increased drug Diphosphate in Injectable Depot drug drug Users.,"Endogenous and exogenous drug hormones may affect mucosal pharmacokinetics (PKs) of topical antiretrovirals such as drug. We present PK data from healthy women using drug vaginal gel, at baseline (follicular and luteal phases) and after drug drug drug (OCP) or depot drug drug (drug) use. CONRAD Anumber-number was a prospective, interventional, open-label, parallel study. We enrolled number women and number completed the study (number and number who selected OCPs or drug, respectively). Participants used number doses of drug gel separated by number hours, without intercourse, and were examined number or number hours after the last dose. We assessed pharmacokinetics in drug, cervicovaginal (CV) aspirate, and vaginal tissue. In general, there were drug significant differences in mucosal drug and drug diphosphate concentrations (P > number.number) in the follicular and luteal phases, except for lower mean drug tissue concentrations (P < number.number) in the follicular phase. drug concentrations significantly decreased in CV aspirate (P < number.number) after drug use, but overall remained very high (>number unit). Mean tissue drug diphosphate increased to number unit after drug use compared with number and number unit in the follicular and luteal phases, respectively (P < number.number). The molecular conversion of drug into drug diphosphate was more effective in drug users (molecular ratio of number.number versus number.number luteal phase, P < number.number). Both menstrual cycle phase and exogenous hormones affect topical drug mucosal and systemic PKs. However, high levels of drug and drug diphosphate were observed in the CV mucosa in the presence or absence of OCPs and drug, with tissue levels exceeding benchmarks of predicted mucosal drug-drug efficacy (drug >number.number unit in CV aspirate and drug diphosphate >number unit).","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",None,METHODS Clinical

19129086,Influence of SLCOnumberBnumber and CYPnumberCnumber gene polymorphisms on drug pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.,"Polymorphisms in drug transporter genes and/or drug-metabolising enzyme genes may contribute to inter-individual variability in drug pharmacokinetics in humans. We sought to determine the joint effects of polymorphisms in the SLCOnumberBnumber drug transporter gene and the drug Pnumber ( CYP ) numberCnumber-metabolising enzyme gene on drug pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. Healthy Caucasian subjects were prospectively enrolled on the drug of SLCOnumberBnumber number T > C genotype. Additionally, subjects were genotyped for SLCOnumberBnumber -number G > A, -number A > C and number A > G polymorphisms, and the CYPnumberCnumber*number polymorphism. SLCOnumberBnumber haplotypes and diplotypes were computationally assigned. drug drug concentrations were determined by high-performance drug chromatography and analysed using drug-compartmental methods. The study population consisted of number subjects, with a mean age of number +/- number years, and a mean weight of number.number +/- number.number kg. There were drug significant differences in drug pharmacokinetic parameters between SLCOnumberBnumber diplotype groups. Subjects with the CYPnumberCnumber*number/*number genotype ( n = number), however, had significantly lower drug area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) and significantly higher drug drug clearance, compared with CYPnumberCnumber wild-type homozygotes ( n = number). Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that CYPnumberCnumber genotype ( p = number.number) and weight ( p = number.number) were significant predictors of drug AUC (overall p = number.number; R number = number.number per cent). We concluded that polymorphisms in the CYPnumberCnumber drug-metabolising enzyme gene, but not the SLCOnumberBnumber drug transporter gene, significantly influence drug disposition in humans. Future studies examining the influence of CYPnumberCnumber genotypes and haplotypes on drug disposition and response in patients with type number diabetes are warranted.","Clinical Trial ;Journal

This double-blind six-way crossover euglycemic drug clamp study was conducted in number healthy volunteers. Each analog was injected subcutaneously (number.number unit) with or without drug. The commercial formulations had comparable drug time-exposure and time-action profiles as follows: number% exposure at number-number min and number% total drug infused at number-number min. With drug, the analogs had faster yet still comparable profiles: number% exposure at number-number min and number% drug infused at number-number min. The accelerated drug with drug led to twice the exposure in the first hour and half the exposure beyond number h, which resulted in number- to number-min faster onset and number- to number-min shorter mean drug of drug action.

19177449,"Pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of drug mofetil in drug with standard-dose or reduced-dose drug in drug transplant recipients.","The pharmacokinetics of drug mofetil (drug) in drug transplant recipients may change because of pharmacokinetic interactions with coadministered drug or because changes in the enterohepatic anatomy may affect biotransformation of drug to drug drug (MPA) and enterohepatic recirculation of MPA through the hydrolysis of drug drug glucuronide to MPA in the gut. In the latter case, the choice of formulation (drug versus intravenous) could have important clinical implications. We randomized drug transplant patients (n = number) to standard (number-number unit) or reduced (number-number unit) trough levels of drug plus intravenous drug followed by drug drug (number g twice daily) with drug. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed after the last intravenous drug dose, after the first drug drug dose, and at selected times drug number weeks. The efficacy and safety of the number regimens were also assessed. Twenty-eight and number patients in the drug standard-dose and reduced-dose groups, respectively, were evaluated. drug significant differences between the drug standard-dose and reduced-dose groups were seen in dose-normalized MPA values of the time to the drug drug concentration (number.number versus number.number hours), the drug drug concentration (number.number +/- number.number versus number.number +/- number.number unit), or the area under the concentration-time curve from number to number hours (AUC(number-number); number.number +/- number.number versus number.number +/- number.number microg h/drug) at week number or at any other time point. drug relationship was observed between the drug trough or AUC(number-number) and MPA AUC(number-number). Exposure to MPA after drug and intravenous administration was similar. Safety and efficacy were similar in the two treatment groups. In conclusion, exposure to MPA is not a function of exposure to drug. The similar safety and efficacy seen with drug plus standard or reduced doses of drug suggest that drug could be combined with reduced doses of drug.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial

23519656,Pharmacokinetics of coadministration of drug extended release and drug extended release.,"_number-drug drug are used adjunctively to psychostimulants in treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when psychostimulants alone do not sufficiently reduce symptoms. However, data on the pharmacokinetic profiles and safety of drug treatments in ADHD are needed. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of drug extended release (GXR) and drug hydrochloride (drug) extended release, alone and in drug. This was an open-label, randomized, three-period crossover, drug-drug interaction study. The study was conducted at a single clinical research center. Thirty-eight healthy adults were randomized in this study. Subjects were administered single drug doses of GXR (drug( ); Shire Development LLC, Wayne, PA, USA) number drug, drug (drug( ); McNeil Pediatrics, Titusville, NJ, USA) number drug, or GXR and drug combined. drug, drug (d-drug), and l-drug (l-drug) levels were measured with drug samples collected predose and up to number h postdose. Safety evaluations included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Thirty-five subjects completed the study. Analyses of the number % confidence intervals (CIs) for the geometric mean ratios of the drug drug concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC ) values for drug and d-drug following administration of GXR or drug alone or combined met strict bioequivalence criteria (number % CIs within the interval of number.number-number.number). Overall, combining GXR and drug did not alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of either drug. Sixteen subjects (number.number %) had at least one TEAE. The most commonly reported TEAEs included headache and dizziness following GXR, drug, and GXR and drug combined. Two subjects had clinically significant abnormalities in ECG results following coadministration: both events were mild and resolved the same day. In this short-term, open-label study of healthy adults, coadministration of GXR and drug did not result in significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. drug unique TEAEs were observed with coadministration of GXR and drug compared with either treatment alone.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC3627016,Materials Methods This open label

26309401,Effects of drug/clavulanic drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug drug.,"drug drug (drug) is mainly metabolized via glucuronide, which is hydrolyzed by _-glucuronidase and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. drug/clavulanic drug (AMC) administration leads to decreased levels of _-glucuronidase-producing bacteria, suggesting that these antibiotics could interrupt enterohepatic circulation and thereby alter the pharmacokinetics of drug. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of AMC on the pharmacokinetics of drug. This was an open-label, two-treatment, one-sequence study in number healthy volunteers. Two treatments were evaluated; treatment drug, in which a single dose of drug number drug was administered, and treatment AMC + drug, in which multiple doses of AMC number/number drug were administered three times daily for number days and then a single dose of drug was administered. drug samples were collected up to number hours. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental methods. Fifteen subjects completed the study. Systemic exposures and peak concentrations of drug were slightly lower with treatment AMC + drug than with treatment drug (AUClast, number.number h drug/L vs number.number h drug/L; C max, number.number unit vs number.number unit). There were drug significant between-treatment effects on pharmacokinetics (number% confidence interval [drug]) of AUClast and C max (number.number [number.number-number.number] and number.number [number.number-number.number], respectively).

In this open-label, two-treatment, crossover study, subjects (n= number) aged number-number years with drug prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were randomized to receive a single dose of drug number drug alone in one period and drug number drug once daily on days number-number with a single dose of drug number drug co-administered on day number in the other period. There was a number-day washout between treatments. Pharmacokinetic endpoints were area under the drug concentration-time curve from time number to infinity (AUC(number, )), drug drug concentration (C(max)), AUC from time number to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC(number,last)), time to C(max) (t(max) ), and half-life (t(number/number)) for S- and R-drug. Pharmacodynamic endpoints were area under the INR-time curve (AUC(INR) ), drug INR (INR(max)), area under the PT-time curve (AUC(PT)) and drug PT (PT(max)). Across all pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparisons, the point estimates of treatment ratio (drug co-administered with drug vs. drug alone) were number-number%. The number% confidence intervals for the ratios of the adjusted geometric means were contained within (number%, number%). There were drug clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests, vital signs or ECG recordings. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug number drug in healthy adults are unaffected by drug number drug. Concomitant administration of drug and drug was well tolerated.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PMC3162655,Methods Inclusion exclusion criteria

We included number patients with epilepsy on stable dosing with drug as mono or adjunctive therapy. drug and drug N-number-glucuronide concentrations were determined in up to two drug samples per patient. Patients were genotyped for UGTnumberAnumber, UGTnumberBnumber, ABCBnumber and SLCnumberAnumber. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by drug-linear mixed effects modelling. Prior knowledge from previous pharmacokinetic studies was incorporated to stabilize the modelling process. A parent-metabolite model was developed to get a more detailed view on the covariate effects on drug metabolism. With a base model drug rate (interindividual variability) was estimated at number.number h(-number) (number.number%), drug clearance at number.number l h(-number) (number.number%) and distribution volume at number.number l (number.number%). drug clearance was associated with genetic factors, patient's weight, drug function, smoking and co-treatment with enzyme inducing or inhibiting drug. In patients with UGTnumberBnumber-numberTT genotype clearance was lower compared with GT and GG genotypes. Clearance was particularly high in patients with UGTnumberBnumber number GG genotype (compared with AA genotype it was number%; number% drug number.number, number% higher). Variability in drug pharmacokinetics is large and quantification of its sources may lead to more precise individual treatment.

9129563,Effect of drug on gastrointestinal motility in relation to CYPnumberDnumber phenotype.,"drug is widely used as an drug and drug drug. The drug effect of drug is mediated by its metabolite drug, which is formed by the polymorphically expressed enzyme CYPnumberDnumber; therefore poor metabolizers have drug analgesia after administration of drug. Like other drug, drug causes a delay of drug emptying and spastic constipation. It is not yet known whether the effect on gastrointestinal motility is mediated by drug or its metabolite drug. To test the hypothesis that the metabolite drug is responsible for the effects of drug on gastrointestinal motility, a randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover study was performed. The orocecal transit time was studied in five extensive and five poor metabolizers of drug with the sulfasalazine-sulfapyridine method, assuming that drug effects are observed in poor metabolizers because negligible amounts of drug are formed. drug differences of orocecal transit times were observed between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers after drug placebo administration. However, after drug drug administration orocecal transit time was significantly prolonged in extensive metabolizer but not poor metabolizer subjects. All pharmacokinetic parameters of drug showed drug differences between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers. The pharmacokinetic parameters (mean +/- SD) of the metabolite drug were significantly different between extensive metabolizer and poor metabolizer subjects (peak serum concentration, number.number +/- number.number versus number.number +/- number.number unit; area under the serum concentration-time curve, number.number +/- number.number versus number.number +/- number.number hr.pmol/drug; total amount of drug excreted in urine, number.number +/- number.number versus number.number +/- number.number mumol). Because the orocecal transit time prolongation after drug administration was observed only in extensive metabolizers, the effect of drug on gastrointestinal motility, like the analgesia, is mediated by its metabolite drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",None,METHODS Study population The study protocol approved ethics committee

Untreated patients (either newly diagnosed or with a history of hypertension but not receiving any drug treatment for  number weeks prior to screening) with a mean SBP  number mmHg and <number mmHg, or pretreated patients (receiving stable treatment with not more than two drug agents for  number weeks prior to screening) with a mean SBP  number mmHg at screening were enrolled.

The key exclusion criteria were use of drug prescription drug, herbal supplements, and/or over_the_counter (drug) drug and dietary supplements (including drug) within number weeks prior to initial dosing, severe hypertension (mean supine diastolic blood pressure (sDBP)  number mmHg and/or mean supine systolic blood pressure (sSBP)  number mmHg), or hypotension (mean sDBP <number mmHg and/or mean sSBP <number mmHg) at screening or at baseline. A number_day washout period was sufficient to eliminate the potential for additional drug interactions, other than those under investigation in this study, as it is longer than five half_lives of all drug drug used prior to screening.

Pharmacokinetic assessments
drug concentrations of drug and its metabolite N_desmethyl_sildenafil were measured following a single dose of drug (Day number) and coadministration of drug and drug/drug (Day number). drug concentrations of drug/drug analytes (drug, drug, and drug) were measured at steady state of drug/drug (Day number) and following coadministration of drug/drug and drug (Day number). Additional predose samples were collected during drug/drug administration (Days number, number, number, and number). A validated liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectroscopy (LC_MS/MS) method was used for quantification of drug, N_desmethyl_sildenafil, and drug/drug analytes in drug.number, number The lower limit of quantification values were number.number unit for drug, N_desmethyl_sildenafil, and drug; number.number unit for drug; and number.number unit for drug.number, number

The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using Phoenix (Build number.number.number.number)/WinNonlin (number.number): area under drug concentration time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUCinf) and to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast), terminal half_life (Tnumber/number), observed drug drug concentration (Cmax), and time to reach drug concentration (Tmax) for drug and N_desmethyl_sildenafil. The pharmacokinetic parameters for drug/drug analytes (drug, drug, and drug) were area under drug concentration time curve from time zero to the end of dosing interval _ (tau) at steady state (AUCtau,ss), observed drug drug concentration following drug administration at steady state (Cmax,ss), and time to reach Cmax,ss after drug administration in the dosing interval (Tmax,ss)

Pharmacodynamic and biomarker assessments
Pharmacodynamic assessments, which comprised number_h ABPMs, including mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (aDBP), mean ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP), and ambulatory mean arterial pressure (aMAP) were obtained every number min during daytime (number am to number pm) and every number h during night time (number pm to number am) prior to any drug treatment (baseline, Day  number), following single dose of drug administration (Day number), steady state of drug/drug (Day number), and coadministration of drug/drug and drug (Day number). Change in night time and daytime ABPM from baseline were calculated using respective baseline night time and daytime ABPM values during the three treatment periods. BP measurements were performed on the nondominant arm using a validated portable recording device and an appropriate cuff size.

For biomarkers (cGMP and ANP) and drug measurements, number_h urine samples were collected in two intervals (number to number h and number to number h) prior to drug treatment (baseline, Day  number), following single dose of drug treatment (Day number), single dose and steady state drug/drug (Days number and number), and following coadministration of drug/drug and drug (Day number). cGMP and ANP were measured at SGS Cephac (Saint_Benoit, France) by radioimmunoassay using commercial kits from Amersham International (Amerhsam, UK) and Izotop (Budapest, Hungary), respectively.number Urine drug was analyzed at Clinical Reference Laboratory (CRL, Cambridgeshire, UK). Urinary cGMP and ANP levels were normalized to drug levels, and reported as creatinine_indexed urine cGMP and creatinine_indexed urine ANP. The lower and upper limit of quantification values were number.number and number.number unit respectively, for urine cGMP, and number.number and number.number unit respectively, for urine ANP measurements.

Safety assessments
Safety assessments consisted of recording all AEs and SAEs with respect to their severity and relationship to the study drug, assessments of vital signs, physical examinations, hematology, blood chemistry, and urine laboratory assessments.

Statistical analyses
Log_transformed pharmacokinetic parameters of drug, N_desmethyl_sildenafil, and drug/drug analytes were analyzed using a fixed effects model with treatment and patient as fixed factors to study the pharmacokinetic interactions between drug/drug analytes and drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters derived following combination treatment were considered as test and those following monotherapy were considered as reference treatments for statistical evaluations. The estimated geometric mean (drug/drug and drug coadministration/single drug treatment) and corresponding number% confidence interval (CI) of treatment difference were back_transformed to obtain the geometric mean ratio (GMR) and number% CI.

Descriptive statistics were provided for BP measurements, including ABPM (daytime, night time, and number_h mean), and urine biomarkers (cGMP and ANP). The number_h ABPM data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis_of_covariance model with treatment, hours postdose, and treatment by hours postdose interaction as fixed factors, patients as random factor, and time_matched baseline as covariate. The area under the effect vs. time curve (AUCnumber_numberh) was calculated for cGMP. Test to reference (or baseline) ratios and CIs were calculated for cGMP, ANP, and ABPM.

Summary statistics were provided for all safety assessments of AEs by treatment and visit/time. The number and percentage of subjects with AEs were categorized by body system and treatment. Deviations from normal ranges were classified as abnormalities."

3221745,"Comparative Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Pharmacology of
drug Enantiomers after drug Administration to Man*","The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic behavior of (R)- and (S)-drug was investigated in a group of seven healthy volunteers,
one of whom belonged to the phenotype of poor drug hydroxy/ators. Each volunteer received number drug of either enantiomer as a solution
in randomized order with a washout period of one week in between. The pharmacodynamic evaluation comprised cardiovascular parameters
(HR, PQ, QRS, QT, BP) and tolerability (self-assessment questionnaire, hematology, clinical chemistry). For pharmacokinetic purposes drug
/el'els of the parent compounds (R, S) and their number-hydroxylated metabolites (number-R, number-S) were measured.
As expected, there was a small but distinct increase of PQ interval with a drug number h after drug intake. No difference was observed between
both enantiomers tested. In the poor hydroxy/a/Or prolongation of PQ interval was less compared to extensive metabolizers, though drug concentrations of the unchanged drug were considerably higher. Inspection of the individual concentration time profiles in the other subjects provided
adduional evidence that the number-OH-metabolite also contributes to this effect. Other ECG parameters, heart rate and blood pressure remained
unaffected.
Both enantiomers were well tolerated: no drug-related side effects concerning general well-being and laboratory parameters were observed.
In contrast to pharmacodynamic effects (on ECG) a distinct enantioselectivity of metabolic and/ or distributive processes can be observed
in the group of efficient hydroxylators manifesting itself in a lower clearance for R (ratio number.number number.number, probability of error < number%), in spite of
a higher terminal elimination rate constant (ratio number.number  number.number, probability of error< number%). This difference cannot be accounted for by the different
degrees of protein binding of the enantiomers (drug(R) = number.number; drug(S) = number.number). The experience obtained with one poor hydroxy/a/Or seems to
indicate that enantioselectivity in terms of drug clearance CI/F might be lost in this phenotype. The distinctly lower clearance values/or the poor
hydroxylaror when compared to the corresponding data for efficient hydroxylators, seem to be the reflecrion of /he lower merabolic capaciry
of this phenotype.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",None,"MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects The study was carried out in a total of number healthy male subjects, aged between number and number years (median number years), with a body weight of number-number kg (median number kg) and a height of number-number cm (median number cm).

Seven days before and during the study the subjects did not take any drug. On the evening before the study and on the study days neither drug nor drinks containing drug were allowed. Apart from that, the subjects' way of life was not affected. Substances The tested substances were enantiomers of drug: number-(number' -hydroxy-number' -propylamino-propoxy)-number- phenyl-propiophenone hydrochloride; relative mo! mass: number.number [g/mol]. (R)-drug (R-PPF;R) was the dextro-rotatory antipode and (S)-drug (SPPF;S) the levo-rotatory antipode.   HCI R-PPF, number drug, hard gelatin snap-fit capsules, lot No. EB number, and S-PPF, number drug, hard gelatin snap-fit capsules, lot No. EB number were administered. For administration the contents of number capsules each were dissolved in approximately number drug warm (""-number C) tap water and given to the subjects. The container used was rinsed with another number drug of tap water which was also taken by the subjects together with the empty gelatin capsules. Treatment scheme and dosage After having been randomly assigned to the number substance groups, the subjects received a single dose of number drug at two different times with a washout period of number week in between (Table number). Study course The study was carried out in the clinical research facility of the Department of Human Pharmacology, Experimental-Medical Research and Development, Knoll drug, Ludwigshafen, under drug conditions. On the specific study days the fasting subjects (i.e., number h without drug and number h without liquid) appeared at number.number a.m. in the ward, where the cardiovascular parameters (HR, PR, QRS, drug, Pd) and the subjective well-being were recorded. After a cannula (Brauniile , size No. number) had been inserted in a lower arm vein and number drug of blood (as the blank value) had been sampled in a heparinized monovette between number.number and number.number a.m., the substance was administered with approximately number drug of tap water at number.number a.m. Further blood samples were taken under the same conditions at the time stated in Table number. Immediately after blood sampling, drug was prepared by centrifugation at number-g and stored at <-number C until analyzed. Standardized (number) blood pressure and ECG control (limb leads I-a VF) were carried out after number and number min of rest in supine position at number h intervals. The standard Knoll self-assessment questionnaire (KF number) (number) was filled in both before and after substance administration. Undesired effects were entered in case record forms. Two hours post application the subjects received a standard breakfast (approximately number calories), number.number h post application a standard lunch (approximately number calories) and number.number h post application a standard dinner (approximately number calories). The intake of liquid was at least number drug per day in order to maintain sufficient diuresis. Pharmacodynamic evaluation The data obtained are evaluated using absolute values and arithmetic means with standard deviations. The individual values are analyzed for relevant differences to the baseline value. This consideration is based on the Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of (R)- and (S)-drug number results of a reference sample with n = number subjects without substance administration under the usual conditions and procedures of a human pharmacological tudy (number). The d,,;, values obtained from the reference sample (a= number.number, two-sided test) which serve as relevance measure, are as follows: heart rate: number.number beats/ min; PQ interval: number. number ms; QRS drug: number.number ms; systolic blood pressure: number.number mmHg; diastolic blood pressure: number.number mmHg. Evaluation of general tolerability General tolerability was determined using the Knoll self-assessment questionnaire. This is a standard questionnaire whose objectivity, reliability and validity have been checked (number). The alterations of well-being are measured in relation to time. The assessment of general tolerability of the two drug enantiomers is based on subjective well-being, scrutiny of the electrocardiograms for pathological changes, the results of the hematological and biochemical parameters and of urinalyses obtained before and after the study, and on any side effects entered in the case record forms. The Knoll self-assessment questionnaire contains number items including number control items. A relevant deterioration of well-being is to be assumed if the individual score is increased by more than number (d,,;,). The hematological and biochemical lab parameters were determined within number weeks before the beginning of the study. The follow-up investigations were carried out number h after administration of both drug enantiomers. The parameters analyzed were as follows: ESR, hemoglobin, erythrocyte, leucocyte, thrombocyte counts, differential blood count, Hb , hematocrit, urinalysis (Combur number, facultative: microscopic sediment analysis), drug, drug, PTT, TT (thrombin time), Quick value, drug, drug, drug, cholinesterase, -y-GT, SOOT and SGPT, total protein and protein electrophoresis. Analytics The determination of the drug enantiomers was performed in duplicates of :s; l drug of drug by means of an analogue standardized HPLC method with fluorescence detection after fluorochromation with drug (number). The quantification of the number-OH metabolites was carried out using HPLC separation on a reverse phase with subsequent electrochemical detection (number). Both methods are selective for the specific analytes; they allow their highly sensitive precise determination at concentrations above I drug/drug (drug) or number unit (number-OH drug) with detection limits of number.number drug/ drug each.
