0	A kinetic and dynamic study of oral alprazolam with and without erythromycin in humans: in vivo evidence for the involvement of CYP3A4 in alprazolam metabolism.	To assess the possible involvement of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of alprazolam in vivo. Twelve healthy male volunteers were randomly allocated to one of the two different treatment sequences, placebo-erythromycin or erythromycin-placebo, with an at least 6-week washout period between the two trial phases. Each volunteer received 400 mg erythromycin or matched placebo given orally three times a day for 10 days and an oral dose (0.8 mg) of alprazolam on the posttreatment day 8. Plasma concentration of alprazolam was measured up to 48 hours after the administration, and psychomotor function was assessed at each time of blood samplings with use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, visual analog scale, and Udvalg for kliniske undersÂ¿gelser side effect rating scale. Erythromycin significantly (p < 0.001) increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curves (200 +/- 43 versus 322 +/- 49 ng . hr/ml from 0 to 48 hours and 229 +/- 52 versus 566 +/- 161 ng . hr/ml from 0 hour to infinity), decreased the apparent oral clearance (1.02 +/- 0.31 versus 0.41 +/- 0.12 ml/min/kg), and prolonged the elimination half-life (16.0 +/- 4.5 versus 40.3 +/- 14.4 hours) of alprazolam. However, any psychomotor function variables did not differ significantly between the erythromycin and placebo trial phases. This study suggests that erythromycin, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, inhibits the metabolism of alprazolam, providing an in vivo evidence for the involvement of CYP3A4 in its metabolism. However, the kinetic change of alprazolam by erythromycin does not result in the pharmacodynamic change of this triazolobenzodiazepine, at least after single dosing.	methods subjects twelve unrelated healthy male subjects age range years weight range kg height range cm participated study no subject history significant medical illness hypersensitivity drugs their healthy normal status judged basis physical examination screening blood chemistries including complete blood count hepatic function test urinalysis electrocardiogram study the study protocol approved ethics committee hirosaki university hospital subject gave written consent study protocol the study conducted doubleblind randomized crossover manner least 6 week washout period erythromycin mg tablet formulation ilotysin shionogi pharmaceutical co osaka japan matched placebo tablet formulation appearance size erythromycin given orally three times day am pm pm days six volunteers group allocated either different drug sequences placeboerythromycin erythromycin placebo the kinetic dynamic study alprazolam conducted inpatient basis overnight fast posttreatment day am single oral mg dose alprazolam solanax japan upjohn ltd tokyo japan tablet formulation given cup tap water blood samples ml collected heparinized tubes antecubital vein l 2 hours dosing no food allowed hours drug administration at times blood samplings psychomotor function status evaluated use digit symbol substitution test dsst adapted wechsler adult intelligence scale minutes visual analog scale vas mood subjective states used pharmacodynamic assessment study chlordiazepoxide item sleepiness udvalg kliniske undersogelser uku side effect rating scale 15 hsuy plasma alprazolam concentrations measured duplicate hplc method developed laboratory alprazolam estazolam internal standard supplied upjohn company kalamazoo mich all solvents used hplc grade wako pure chemical industries osaka japan all reagents purchased waco pure chemical industries nakarai tesque kyoto japan we added ng estazolam l l methanol ml plasma sample the plasma sample diluted ml mol l sodium chloride solution briefly mixed the mixture applied sep pak cn cartridge waters chromatography milford mass previously activated ml acetonitrile water the cartridge washed ml water the fraction desired eluted ml acetonitrile the eluate evaporated dryness vacuum c the residue dissolved methanol l l mobile phase sample injected onto hplc system the hplc system consisted rheodyne model injector rheodyne inc cotati calif stainless steel column mm x mm internal diameter packed develosil cs 5 stationary phase km nomura chemical seto japan jasco model pu 880 chromatography pump jasco tokyo japan jasco uvidec ultraviolet detector jasco tokyo japan the wavelength set nm the mobile phase consisted ph monobasic potassium phosphate acetonitrile vol vol the flow rate mlimin yusui et al clikical phhtm 4colow thtlup iltics hlay time hours fig mean plasma concentration time data single oral dose mg alprazolam treatment placebo erythromycin open solid circles indicate mean data observed treatment placebo erythromycin respectively subjects asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared placebo trial phase p p p ambient temperature retention times alprazolam estazolam minutes respectively the lowest limit detection rig ml coefficient variation intraassay interassay less data analysis the elimination rate constant k alprazolam estimated nonlinear least squares regression analysis terminal loglinear concentration time data elimination half life calculated 0 693 k the area plasma concentration time curve hours auc o 48 calculated trapezoidal rule the area plasma concentration time curve hour infinity auc o m total auc calculated auc o 48 c k c plasma concentration alprazolam hours dosing the apparent oral clearance cl calculated follows dose total auc this clearance term influenced absolute oral bioavailability determined study the peak plasma concentration c time c tmax read observed plasma concentration time data individuals used estimate rate drug absorption the data given mean values sd statistical analyses performed paired test wilcoxon singed rank test appropriate a p value considered statistically significant	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
1	A potentially hazardous interaction between erythromycin and midazolam.	Interaction between erythromycin and midazolam was investigated in two double-blind, randomized, crossover studies. In the first study, 12 healthy volunteers were given 500 mg erythromycin three times a day or placebo for 1 week. On the sixth day, the subjects ingested 15 mg midazolam. In the second study, midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) was given intravenously to six of the same subjects, after similar pretreatments. Plasma samples were collected, and psychomotor performance was measured. Erythromycin increased the area under the midazolam concentration-time curve after oral intake more than four times (p < 0.001) and reduced clearance of intravenously administered midazolam by 54% (p < 0.05). In psychomotor tests (e.g., saccadic eye movements), the interaction between erythromycin and orally administered midazolam was statistically significant (p < 0.05) from 15 minutes to 6 hours. Metabolism of both erythromycin and midazolam by the same cytochrome P450IIIA isozyme may explain the observed pharmacokinetic interaction. Prescription of midazolam for patients receiving erythromycin should be avoided or the dose of midazolam should be reduced by 50% to 75%.	material and methods study design orally administered

2	A semi-mechanistic absorption model to evaluate drug-drug interaction with dabigatran: application with clarithromycin.	The aim of this study was to develop a PK/PD model to assess drug-drug interactions between dabigatran and P-gp modulators, using the example of clarithromycin, a strong inhibitor of P-gp. Ten healthy male volunteers were randomized to receive in the first treatment period a single 300_mg dose of dabigatran etexilate (DE) and in the second treatment period 500_mg clarithromycin twice daily during 3 days and then 300_mg DE plus 500_mg clarithromycin on the fourth day, or the same treatments in the reverse sequence. Dabigatran plasma concentration and ecarin clotting time (ECT) were measured on 11 blood samples. Models were built using a non-linear mixed effect modelling approach. The best PK model was based on an inverse Gaussian absorption process with two compartments. The relationship between dabigatran concentration and ECT was implemented as a linear function. No continuous covariate was associated with a significant decrease in the objective function. The concomitant administration of clarithromycin induced a significant change only in DE bioavailability, which increased from 6.5% to 10.1% in the presence of clarithromycin. Clarithromycin increased peak concentration and AUC by 60.2% and 49.1% respectively. The model proposed effectively describes the complex PK of dabigatran and takes into account drug-drug interactions with P-gp activity modulators, such as clarithromycin.	methods ten healthy male

3	A study of the interaction potential of azithromycin and clarithromycin with atorvastatin in healthy volunteers.	Atorvastatin is a common option among the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for the treatment of lipid disorders because of its excellent lipid-lowering efficacy and overall safety profile. Although these agents can rarely cause rhabdomyolysis by themselves, macrolides, among other agents, have been demonstrated to increase the likelihood of this via inhibition of CYP metabolism of the lipid agent. This study investigated the potential for azithromycin and clarithromycin to inhibit the metabolism of atorvastatin. Although there was no interaction between azithromycin and atorvastatin, clarithromycin did have a significant effect on atorvastatin pharmacokinetic parameters. When coadministered, clarithromycin raised subject exposure (AUC24) by 82% and peak plasma concentrations by 56%. These data suggest that while azithromycin appears to be safe to coadminister with atorvastatin, clarithromycin should be avoided in patients taking this and similarly metabolized HMG-CoA inhibitors.	materials and methods this randomized open label three treatment arm parallel design study approved research consultants review committee austin tx con american college clinical

4	Absolute bioavailability of clarithromycin after oral administration in humans.	The absolute bioavailability of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antimicrobial agent, was assessed in a three-way, randomized, single-dose, crossover study conducted with 22 healthy volunteers, 19 of whom provided analyzable study data. The bioavailability parameters of two 250-mg oral tablet formulations were calculated with reference to an identical dose administered by intravenous infusion of the lactobionate salt. After adjustment for formulation potency, the mean absolute bioavailabilities of the two oral formulations were 52 and 55%, on the basis of the appearance of parent compound in the systemic circulation. Metabolite peak concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve data after oral dosing were generally greater than those after intravenous infusion, suggesting that marked first-pass metabolism of clarithromycin occurs after oral administration. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the parent drug and the active 14-hydroxy metabolite data suggests complete (or nearly complete) absorption of the drug after oral administration.	clarithromycin new 14

5	Absolute bioavailability of oral immediate and slow release fluphenazine in healthy volunteers.	The present study was conducted with the aim of investigating the absolute bioavailability of fluphenazine in healthy volunteers after administration of immediate and slow release oral formulations. The oral dose was 12 mg fluphenazine hydrochloride. The intravenous bolus dose was 2.5 mg. Fourteen healthy volunteers of both sexes were enrolled in this randomised, crossover trial. Twelve volunteers completed the trial according to protocol. The concentration maxima after administration of the slow release formulation were approximately half those measured after the immediate release formulation and were recorded later by a factor of 2 (immediate release: Cmax = 2.3 ng.ml-1, tmax = 2.8 h; slow release: Cmax = 1.2 ng.ml-1, tmax = 4.6 h). The concentrations measured 10 min after intravenous bolus administration of 2.5 mg fluphenazine hydrochloride were approximately 100 times higher (261 ng.ml-1). The geometric means for the absolute bioavailability of fluphenazine were 2.7% for the immediate release formulation and 3.4% for the slow release formulation. The absolute bioavailability of fluphenazine is thus much lower than previously generally accepted.	materials methods the study performed accordance relevant articles declaration helsinki revised tokyo venice hong kong before admitted clinical study volunteers consented participation writing nature scope possible consequences trial explained physician form understandable volunteer the trial conducted national centre oncology so a bulgaria before start study study protocol appropriate documents approved ethics committee medical academy so a fourteen healthy volunteers eight male six female enrolled trial the mean sd weight height age volunteers enrolled kg cm years respectively the volunteers subjected standardised clinical laboratory examination trial all volunteers received two single oral doses mg uphenazine hcl lyorodin mg uphenazine hcl tablet batch no lyogen retard mg uphenazine hcl tablet batch no intravenous dose mg lyogen solution mg uphenazine hcl ampoule batch no least h fasting three di erent days the washout period days the three doses administered according randomisation table all volunteers received standard meals h administration study medication the total intake water within rst h post dose l blood samples ml drawn min h dose the serum separated samples stored 920 cid 176 c analysed the quantitation uphenazine serum conducted means hplc coulometric detection according method described cooper et al the limit quantitation ng ml91 the intra assay variance concentration range ng ml91 respectively the interassay variance concentration range cmax the pharmacokinetic evaluation conducted model independent way means topfit programme concentration maxima achieve maximal concentration tmax area concentration vs time curve determined according trapezoid rule last concentration limit quantitation auc0 last terminal elimination half life t1 2 mean residence time total clearance uphenazine directly measured calculated time needed the primary objective trial provide information absolute bioavailability uphenazine oral administration this question answered determining position con dence intervals individual p o i v ratios auc0 last means anova anova log since trial conducted three periods non parametric statistical methods widely used bioavailability bioequivalence trials wilcoxon test according hauschke et al validated two period design non parametric methods used	PK Trial	PK Trial	PK Trial	1	1	1
6	Absolute oral bioavailability of rosuvastatin in healthy white adult male volunteers.	Rosuvastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitor developed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. The results of clinical trials suggest that it is effective and well tolerated. The goals of this study were to determine the absolute bioavailability of an oral dose of rosuvastatin and to describe the intravenous pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in healthy volunteers. This was a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover study consisting of 2 trial days separated by a > or =7-day washout period. Healthy male adult volunteers were given a single oral dose of rosuvastatin 40 mg on one trial day and an intravenous infusion of rosuvastatin 8 mg over 4 hours on the other. Pharmacokinetic and tolerability assessments were conducted up to 96 hours after dosing. A 3-compartment pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the plasma concentration-time profiles obtained for each volunteer after intravenous dosing. Ten white male volunteers entered and completed the trial. Their mean age was 35.7 years (range, 21-51 years), their mean height was 177 cm (range, 169-182 cm), and their mean body weight was 77.6 kg (range, 68-85 kg). The absolute oral bioavailability of rosuvastatin was estimated to be 20.1%,and the hepatic extraction ratio was estimated to be 0.63. The mean volume of distribution at steady state was 134 L. Renal clearance accounted for approximately 28% of total plasma clearance (48.9 L/h). Single oral and intravenous doses of rosuvastatin were well tolerated in this small number of healthy male volunteers. The absolute oral bioavailability of rosuvastatin in these 10 healthy volunteers was approximately 20%, and absorption was estimated to be 50%. The volume of distribution at steady state was consistent with extensive distribution of rosuvastatin to the tissues. The modest absolute oral bioavailability and high hepatic extraction of rosuvastatin are consistent with first-pass uptake into the liver after oral dosing. Rosuvastatin was cleared by both renal and nonrenal routes; tubular secretion was the predominant renal process.	subjects and methods inclusion exclusion criteria healthy male volunteers aged years

7	Amiodarone interacts with simvastatin but not with pravastatin disposition kinetics.	The aim of this study was to determine the influence of amiodarone on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and pravastatin in humans. This was a prospective, crossover, randomized, open-label study performed in 12 healthy volunteers comparing the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of simvastatin (40 mg) or pravastatin (40 mg) taken alone and after 3 days of amiodarone (400 mg/day). Amiodarone increased simvastatin acid AUC (area under the plasma concentration-time curve)0-24 h, peak plasma concentration (Cmax), and t1/2 by 73% (P=0.02), 100% (P=0.02), and 48% (P=0.06), respectively, whereas it did not significantly alter pravastatin pharmacokinetics. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for simvastatin acid, simvastatin lactone, and pravastatin AUC0-24 h were 154% (109-216%), 155% (109-227%), and 86% (63-118%), respectively. If amiodarone and a statin have to be simultaneously prescribed, pravastatin should be preferred to simvastatin in order to avoid a drug interaction.	methods subjects twelve white occidental healthy

8	An assessment of drug-drug interactions: the effect of desvenlafaxine and duloxetine on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2D6 probe desipramine in healthy subjects.	A number of antidepressants inhibit the activity of the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme system, which can lead to drug-drug interactions. Based on its metabolic profile, desvenlafaxine, administered as desvenlafaxine succinate, a new serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is not expected to have an impact on activity of CYP2D6. This single-center, randomized, open-label, four-period, crossover study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of desvenlafaxine (100 mg/day, twice the recommended therapeutic dose for major depressive disorder in the United States) and duloxetine (30 mg b.i.d.) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of desipramine (50 mg). A single dose of desipramine was given first to assess its PK. Desvenlafaxine or duloxetine was then administered, in a crossover design, so that steady-state levels were achieved; a single dose of desipramine was then coadministered. The geometric least-square mean ratios (coadministration versus desipramine alone) for area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) of desipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine were compared using analysis of variance. Relative to desipramine alone, increases in AUC and C(max) of desipramine associated with duloxetine administration (122 and 63%, respectively) were significantly greater than those associated with desvenlafaxine (22 and 19%, respectively; P < 0.001). Duloxetine coadministered with desipramine was also associated with a decrease in 2-hydroxydesipramine C(max) that was significant compared with the small increase seen with desvenlafaxine and desipramine (-24 versus 9%; P < 0.001); the difference between changes in 2-hydroxydesipramine AUC did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.054). Overall, desvenlafaxine had a minimal impact on the PK of desipramine compared with duloxetine, suggesting a lower risk for CYP2D6-mediated drug interactions.	materials methods this single center

9	Assessing the clinical significance of botanical supplementation on human cytochrome P450 3A activity: comparison of a milk thistle and black cohosh product to rifampin and clarithromycin.	Phytochemical-mediated modulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) may underlie many herb-drug interactions. This study's purpose was to assess the effects of milk thistle and black cohosh supplementation on CYP3A activity and compare them to a clinically recognized inducer, rifampin, and inhibitor, clarithromycin. Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive a standardized milk thistle (900 mg) or black cohosh (80 mg) supplement for 14 days. Subjects also received rifampin (600 mg) and clarithromycin (1000 mg) for 7 days as positive controls for CYP3A induction and inhibition, respectively. Midazolam was administered orally before and after each supplementation and control period. The effects of milk thistle, black cohosh, rifampin, and clarithromycin on midazolam pharmacokinetics were determined using noncompartmental techniques. Unlike those observed for rifampin and clarithromycin, midazolam pharmacokinetics was unaffected by milk thistle or black cohosh. Milk thistle and black cohosh appear to have no clinically relevant effect on CYP3A activity in vivo.	methods study subjects the university of arkansas for medical sciences hu- man research advisory committee (little rock, ark) approved this study protocol, and all participants pro- vided written informed consent before commencing the study. nineteen young adults (9 women; age [mean Â± sd] = 28 Â± 6 years; weight = 76.5 Â± 16.4 kg) partici- pated in the study, and all subjects were in good health as indicated by medical history, routine physical exam- ination, electrocardiography, and clinical laboratory testing. all subjects were nonsmokers, ate a normal diet, were not users of botanical dietary supplements, and were not taking prescription or nonprescription medications. all female subjects had a negative preg- nancy test at baseline. all subjects were instructed to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, fruit juices, cruciferous vegetables, and charbroiled meat throughout each 2- week phase of the study. adherence to these restric- tions was further emphasized 5 days before mdz ad- ministration. subjects were also instructed to refrain from taking prescription and nonprescription medica- Â© 2006 american college of clinical pharmacology. all rights reserved. not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution. downloaded from http://www.jclinpharm.org at univ washington libraries on october 12, 2007 botanical supplementation and human cytochrome p450 3a activity tions during supplementation periods, and any medi- cation use during this time was documented. documentation of compliance to these restrictions was achieved through the use of a food/medication diary. supplements and supplementation/medication regimens the effect of milk thistle, black cohosh, rifampin, and clarithromycin on mdz pharmacokinetics was eval- uated individually on 4 separate occasions in each subject. this was an open-label study randomized for supplementation/medication sequence. (Ãsupplementation/ medicationÃ refers either to milk thistle, black cohosh, rifampin, or clarithromycin.) each supplementation phase (milk thistle or black cohosh) lasted 14 days, while each medication phase (rifampin or clarithromycin) was of 7 daysÃ duration. each supplementation/medication phase was fol- lowed by a 30-day washout period. this randomly as- signed sequence of supplementation/medication fol- lowed by washout was repeated until each subject had received all 4 products. single lots of milk thistle (lot #41678) and black cohosh (lot #41924) were purchased from the same vendor (enzymatic therapy inc, green bay, wis). (enzymatic therapy inc is a leader in the bo- tanical supplement industry for providing products of high quality and consistency.) rifampin (rifadin; aventis pharmaceuticals, kansas city, mo) and clarithromycin (biaxin; abbott laboratories, north chicago, ill) were used as positive controls for cyp3a induction and inhibition, respectively. product labels were followed regarding the administration of milk thistle (300 mg, 3 times daily, standardized to contain 80% silymarin), black cohosh extract (40 mg, twice daily, standardized to 2.5% triterpene glycosides), rifampin (300 mg, twice daily), and clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily). telephone and e-mail reminders were used to facilitate compliance, while pill counts and supplementation usage records were used to verify compliance. mdz administration following an overnight fast, subjects reported to the university of arkansas for medical sciences general clinical research center for mdz administration and blood sampling. prior to mdz administration, subjects were weighed and questioned about their adherence to the dietary and medication restrictions. female sub- jects were administered pregnancy tests, and only those with negative test results were allowed to partici- pate. following the placement of a 20-gauge, indwelling catheter into a peripheral vein of the fore- arm, an oral dose of mdz (8 mg; bedford laboratories, bedford, ohio) was administered with 240 ml of water. throughout the study, mdz doses were admin- istered 24 hours before the start of each supplementation/medication phase (baseline) and again on the last day of each phase. serial blood sam- ples were obtained before and at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after mdz administration. blood samples were allowed to clot for 30 minutes then cen- trifuged at 2500 rpm. serum was removed, placed in 3- ml cryovials, and stored at Ã70Â¡c until analysis. each subjectÃs blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate were monitored at 0.5, 1, and 2 hours post-mdz admin- istration. four hours after dosing, subjects received identical meals consisting of a turkey sandwich, potato chips, carrot sticks, and water. determination of mdz and 1_-hdmz serum concentrations standard solutions of mdz and hmdz (sigma, st louis, mo) were prepared in methanol to give stock so- lutions of 1.0 Âµg/ml and were stored at Ã20Â¡c until use. the internal standard, mdz-[15n3] (a gift from roche laboratories, nutley, nj), was prepared to yield a stock solution of 0.2 ng/ml in methanol. working standards were prepared daily in drug-free serum from the stock solution to yield concentrations of 250, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5.0, 2.50, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 ng/ml. five hundred microliters of 0.2m sodium acetate (ph 4.75) was added to each 250-Âµl serum aliquot. a total of 250 Âµl of ice-cold _-glucuronidase (sigma, st louis, mo) was then added and the sample gently agi- tated. samples were incubated at 37Â¡c for 2.5 hours. after incubation, 2 ml of 0.1% h3po4 was added along with 50 Âµl of the internal standard (mdz-[15n3]), and samples were vortex-mixed for 30 seconds. a strata x- c solid-phase extraction (spe) column (phenomenex, torrance, calif) was used to extract mdz and hmdz from serum. spe columns were preconditioned with methanol/water. serum samples were then loaded onto spe columns and washed with 2 ml of 0.1% h3po4 in 50:50 methanol:acetonitrile followed by 1 ml of 50:50 methanol:acetonitrile. mdz and hmdz were eluted by gravity flow using 3 ml 6% ammonia in 50:50 methanol:acetonitrile. eluents were dried under nitrogen and reconstituted in 75 Âµl lc/ms mobile phase a (30% acetonitrile, 5 mm ammonium formate drug metabolism 203 Â© 2006 american college of clinical pharmacology. all rights reserved. not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution. downloaded from http://www.jclinpharm.org at univ washington libraries on october 12, 2007 gurley et al ph 3.0). samples were then transferred to microcentri- fuge tubes and centrifuged at 13 200 rpm. using a model 10avp modular high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) system (shimadzu corp, columbia, md), 10-Âµl aliquots were injected onto a 10 _ 0.2 cm gemini 5-Âµm c18 column (phenomenex, torrance, calif). mdz and hmdz were eluted at a flow of 0.2 ml/min using a 4-minute linear gradient from 30% to 80% acetonitrile:ammonium formate (5 mm ph 3.0). analytes were converted to gas- phase ions in a turboion spray heated electrospray ionization source (mds sciex, concord, ontario, can- ada) operated at +4400 v and 425Â¡c. ions were resolved and detected in an api3000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (mds sciex, concord, ontario, canada) by multiple reaction monitoring. mdz and hmdz se- rum concentrations were quantified by a comparison of the ratio of their peak areas to that of the internal con- trol, mdz-[15n3]. validation studies found that standard curves were linear over the range of 250 to 0.1 ng/ml and yielded correlation coefficients >0.995. the limit of quantitation was 0.1 ng/ml, and the limit of detection was 0.02 ng/ml. mean recoveries of mdz and hmdz were 92% and 85%, respectively. relative standard de- viations for interday accuracy and precision assess- ments for quality control standards at 120, 20, and 1.5 ng/ml were <10%. 80:20, designated solvent b) was used to separate the flavanolignans. a mixture of 85:15 (solvent a:b) was initiated for 5 minutes at a flow of 0.75 ml/min, fol- lowed by a linear gradient over 15 minutes to achieve a mixture of 45:55 (solvent a:b), which was held con- stant for an additional 20 minutes. the gradient was then ramped down linearly over 10 minutes to the orig- inal concentration (85:15, a:b). column eluent was monitored by a model 996 photodiode array detector (waters corp) at a wavelength of 290 nm. retention times for taxifolin, silichristin, silidianin, silibinin a, and silibinin b were 9.6, 16.5, 18.8, 23.7, and 24.7 min- utes, respectively. the lower limit of quantitation for each analyte was 0.01 Âµg/ml. the interday accuracy and precision for silymarin components at 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 Âµg/ml was <8%. black cohosh was analyzed for triterpene glycosides (cimiracemosides, cimicifugoside, 27-deoxyactein, and actein; chromadex inc, santa ana, calif) using reversed-phase hplc with evaporative light-scattering detection as described previously.42 standard curves for each standard were linear over the range of 10 to 400 Âµg/ml. the limit of quantitation for cimiracemoside (the least prevalent component) was 10 Âµg/ml. extrac- tion recoveries exceeded 95%, and relative standard deviations for interday accuracy and precision assess- ments were <5%. supplement analysis pharmacokinetic analysis and phenotype assessment the phytochemical content of each supplement was independently analyzed for specific marker com- pounds by hplc. analytical standards of the flavanolignans taxifolin, silychristin, silydianin, silibinin a, and silibinin b were purchased from chromadex, inc (santa ana, calif). standard solutions of each flavanolignan were prepared in methanol cov- ering a range of 0.01 to 1 Âµg/ml and used for quantita- tive purposes. flavanolignan content of milk thistle was quantitated using a previously published method.41 briefly, contents of 6 milk thistle capsules were placed in individual brown glass bottles and dis- solved in 75 ml of ethanol. the contents of each ves- sel were agitated at 75 rpm for 4 hours at 60Â¡c. one- milliliter aliquots were removed, evaporated under nitrogen, and redissolved in 1 ml methanol. ten microliters was injected onto a symmetry c18 column (150 mm _ 4.6 mm, 5 Âµm;

pharsight, mountain view, calif). area under the serum concentration-time curves from 0 to 6 hours (auc0-6) were determined by use of the trapezoidal rule. the ter- minal elimination rate constant (ke) was calculated us- ing the slope of the log-linear regression of the terminal elimination phase. area under the serum concentra- tion versus time curve from 0 to infinity (auc0-Â°) was calculated using the log-linear trapezoidal rule up to the last measured time concentration (clast) with extrap- olation to infinity using clast/ke. the elimination half- life was calculated as 0.693/ke. the apparent oral clear- ance of mdz (cl/f) was calculated as dose/auc0-Â°. peak mdz concentrations (cmax) and the times when they occurred (tmax) were derived directly from the data. the justification of specified time points for obtain- ing metabolite/parent serum ratios to estimate probe drug clearance has been previously addressed.13 serum 204 Â¥ j clin pharmacol 2006;46:201-213 Â© 2006 american college of clinical pharmacology. all rights reserved. not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution. downloaded from http://www.jclinpharm.org at univ washington libraries on october 12, 2007 botanical supplementation and human cytochrome p450 3a activity ratios of hmdz/mdz determined 1 hour after dosing were used to estimate cyp3a activity. differences in pre- and postsupplementation/medication hmdz/ mdz ratios obtained 1 hour after mdz dosing were used to estimate the effects of rifampin, clarithromycin, milk thistle, and black cohosh on cyp3a phenotype. disintegration tests an absence of botanical-mediated effects on mdz pharmacokinetics could stem from products exhibit- ing poor disintegration and/or dissolution characteris- tics. to address this concern, each product was sub- jected to disintegration testing as outlined in the united states pharmacopeia 28.43 the disintegration apparatus consisted of a basket-rack assembly operated at 29 to 32 cycles per minute with 0.1 n hcl (37Â¡c) as the immersion solution. one dosage unit (uncoated tablet or soft gel capsule) of each supplement was placed into each of the 6 basket assembly tubes. the time required for the complete disintegration of 6 dos- age units was determined. this process was repeated with an additional 6 dosage units to ensure accuracy. since there are no specifications for the disintegration time of the botanical supplements used in this study, the mean of 6 individual dosage units was taken as the disintegration time for that particular product. a prod- uct was considered completely disintegrated if the en- tire residue passed through the mesh screen of the test apparatus, except for capsule shell fragments, or if the remaining soft mass exhibited no palpably firm core. statistical analysis a repeated-measures anova model was fit for each pharmacokinetic parameter using sas proc mixed software (sas institute, inc, cary, nc). since pre- and postsupplementation/medication pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in each subject for all 4 of the study phases, a covariance structure existed for measurements within subjects. gender, supplement/ medication, and supplement/medication-by-gender terms were estimated for each parameter using a huynh-feldt covariance structure fit. if supplement/ medication-by-gender interaction terms for a specific parameter measure were significant at the 5% level, the focus of the postsupplementation/medication minus presupplementation/medication response was assessed according to gender. if the supplement/ medication-by-gender interaction was not statistically significant, responses for both genders were combined. an identical approach was taken to evaluate the ef- fects of the supplementation/medication scheme on 1- hour hmdz/mdz ratios. in addition, a power analysis was performed to estimate the ability to detect signifi- cant post- minus presupplementation/medication ef- fects. all 4 models obtained at least 80% power at the 5% level of significance to detect a cohen effect size of 1.32 to 1.50 standard deviation units.44 a pearsonÃs cor- relation analysis for 1-hour hmdz/mdz serum ratios and mdz oral clearance was also performed using sas proc corr software (sas institute, inc, cary, nc).

10	Atomoxetine hydrochloride: clinical drug-drug interaction prediction and outcome.	In the studies reported here, the ability of atomoxetine hydrochloride (Strattera) to inhibit or induce the metabolic capabilities of selected human isoforms of cytochrome P450 was evaluated. Initially, the potential of atomoxetine and its two metabolites, N-desmethylatomoxetine and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, to inhibit the metabolism of probe substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A was evaluated in human hepatic microsomes. Although little inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activity was observed, inhibition was predicted for CYP3A (56% predicted inhibition) and CYP2D6 (60% predicted inhibition) at concentrations representative of high therapeutic doses of atomoxetine. The ability of atomoxetine to induce the catalytic activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A in human hepatocytes was also evaluated; however, atomoxetine did not induce either isoenzyme. Based on the potential of interaction from the in vitro experiments, drug interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted using probe substrates for CYP2D6 (desipramine) in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer subjects and CYP3A (midazolam) in CYP2D6 poor metabolizer subjects. Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of desipramine (single dose of 50 mg) were not altered when coadministered with atomoxetine (40 or 60 mg b.i.d. for 13 days). Only modest changes (approximately 16%) were observed in the plasma pharmacokinetics of midazolam (single dose of 5 mg) when coadministered with atomoxetine (60 mg b.i.d. for 12 days). Although at high therapeutic doses of atomoxetine inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A was predicted, definitive in vivo studies clearly indicate that atomoxetine administration with substrates of CYP2D6 and CYP3A does not result in clinically significant drug interactions.	materials and methods reference compounds and other materials the following compounds were synthesized at lilly research laboratories: atomoxetine hydrochloride, (strattera; ly139603; (_)-n-methyl-3-phenyl-3-(o-tolyloxy)-propylamine hydrochloride), 2h7- atomoxetine, n-desmethylatomoxetine hydrochloride [(_)-3-phenyl-3- (o-tolyloxy)-propylamine hydrochloride], 4-hydroxyatomoxetine oxalate [(_)-n-methyl-3-phenyl-3-(o-tolyloxy-4-hydroxy)-propylamine oxalate], and 2h5-4-hydroxyatomoxetine oxalate. midazolam was obtained from f. hoffmann-la roche (nutley, nj) and 4_-hydroxy diclofenac was obtained from bd gentest (woburn, ma). bufuralol, 1_-hydroxy bufuralol, and 1_-hydroxy midazolam were purchased from ultrafine (manchester, uk). acetaminophen was obtained from eastman kodak (rochester, ny). diclofenac, phenacetin, nadph, rifampicin, 3-methylcholanthrene, and salicyl- amide were purchased from sigma-aldrich (st. louis, mo). resoru- fin and 7-ethoxyresorufin were obtained from molecular probes (eu- gene, or). hepatocyte maintenance medium (hmm), gentamicin, and amphotericin b were purchased from cambrex bio science walkersville, inc. (walkersville, md). in vitro inhibition studies human liver samples were obtained from the liver transplant unit at the medical college of wisconsin (milwaukee, wi) and indiana university school of medicine (indianapolis, in) under protocols approved by the appropriate committee for the conduct of human research. microsomes were prepared by differential centrifugation (van der hoeven and coon, 1974). for the evaluation of cyp1a2, 2c9, 3a, and 2d6 activity in human microsomes, preparations were preincubated for 3 min at 37Â¡c before the initiation of the reaction with nadph. the amount of organic solvent in the preparations was less than 2% of the incubation volume. the reactions were stopped with the addition of an equal volume of solvent (cyp1a2, 2c9, and 3a) or 7.5 of a 60% perchloric acid solution (cyp2d6). o-deethylation of phenacetin (cyp1a2). incubations con- tained human liver microsomes (0.5 mg/ml protein) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), 1 mm nadph, and phenacetin (12.5, 25, 50, 75, or 100 _m), in the absence or presence of atomox- etine (10, 200, 500, or 800 _m), n-desmethylatomoxetine (50, 100, 250, or 500 _m) or 4-hydroxyatomoxetine (0.5, 1.0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, or 500 _m) as inhibitor. after 30-min incubations (linear rate conditions) at 37Â¡c, samples were analyzed for formation of acet- aminophen (ring et al., 2001). 4_-hydroxylation of diclofenac (cyp2c9). incubations con- tained human liver microsomes (0.25 mg/ml protein) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), 1 mm nadph, and diclofenac (2.5, 5, 10, 25, or 50 _m), in the absence or presence of atomoxetine inhibition and induction of p450 by strattera 411 (10, 100, 200, 500, or 800 _m), n-desmethylatomoxetine (25, 50, 100, or 250 _m), or 4-hydroxyatomoxetine (0.5, 1.0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, or 500 _m) as inhibitor. after 15-min incubations (linear rate condi- tions) at 37Â¡c, samples were analyzed for the formation of 4_-hydroxy diclofenac (ring et al., 2001). 1_-hydroxylation of bufuralol (cyp2d6). incubations con- tained human liver microsomes (0.1 mg/ml protein) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), 1 mm nadph, and bufuralol (5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 _m), in the absence or presence of atomoxetine (3.75, 7.5, 15, or 25 _m), n-desmethylatomoxetine (1, 5, 10, or 20 _m) or 4-hydroxyatomoxetine (5, 10, 25, or 50 _m) as inhibitor. after 30-min incubations (linear rate conditions) at 37Â¡c, samples were analyzed for the formation of 1_-hydroxy bufuralol (ring et al., 1996). 1_-hydroxylation of midazolam (cyp3a). incubations con- tained human liver microsomes (0.5 mg/ml protein) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), 1 mm nadph, and midazolam (5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 _m) in the absence or presence of atomoxetine (25, 50, 75, or 100 _m), n-desmethylatomoxetine (1, 10, 25, or 50 _m), or 4-hydroxyatomoxetine (25, 75, 250, or 500 _m) as inhibitor. after 1-min incubations (linear rate conditions) at 37Â¡c, samples were analyzed for the formation of 1_-hydroxy midazolam (ring et al., 2001). in vitro induction studies hepatocytes were isolated from three donors and were cultured as described by strom et al. (1996). hepatocyte monolayers in six-well culture plates (seeded with approximately 1 million cells/well) were incubated with 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 _m atomoxetine in hmm supplemented with 100 nm insulin, 100 nm dexamethasone, 50 _g/ml gentamicin, and 50 ng/ml amphotericin b for approximately 48 h in triplicate wells. the concentrations of atomoxetine used in the induction experiments overlap the plasma concentrations of ato- moxetine observed after repeated oral administration (table 1). cells were also incubated with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle control), 1 _g/ml 3-methylcholanthrene (cyp1a2 induction control), and 10 _m rifampicin (cyp3a induction control). after the incubation, the cells were washed and then preincubated with 3 mm salicylamide, which was used to inhibit metabolite conjugation, for 10 min. assessment of cyp1a2 and cyp3a activity was then performed with 2 _m 7-ethoxyresorufin or 10 _m midazolam, respectively, in hmm con- taining 3 mm salicylamide (7-ethoxyresorufin incubations only) for 30 min. samples were analyzed using a reverse-phase liquid chro- matography/mass spectrometry method for formation of 1_-hy- droxymidazolam (wrighton and ring, 1994) or resorufin (burke and mayer, 1983). cells were harvested by scraping in 0.5 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 7.4), and protein content was deter- mined by the method of lowry et al. (1951). to evaluate statistical significance among the treatment groups, single-factor analysis of variance was performed. treatment groups, including the positive control were compared with the vehicle- treated control, and all groups consisted of three replicate wells. for cyp3a activity, the samples from each of the three wells were analyzed in duplicate, whereas for cyp1a2 activities the samples from each of the three wells were analyzed by a single determination. in vitro prediction strategy apparent kinetic parameters of km, vmax, and ki, as well as the standard error of the estimated parameter were determined after the l d o w n o a d e d f r o m j p e t . a s p e t j o u r n a s . l o r g a t u n v i o f p i t t s b u r g h l l a n g e y h a l l l b i o n m a y 2 7 , 2 0 1 1 fig. 1. chemical structures of atomoxetine and its primary oxidative metabolites 4-hydroxyato- moxetine and n-desmethylatomoxetine. 412 sauer et al. table 1 estimated maximal plasma concentrations of atomoxetine and its metabolites in cyp2d6 extensive and poor metabolizer populations following 1.0 mg/kg twice-daily doses (2.0 mg/kg/day) of atomoxetine hydrochloride cyp2d6 extensive metabolizers atomoxetine n-desmethylatomoxetine 4-hydroxyatomoxetine cyp2d6 poor metabolizers atomoxetine n-desmethylatomoxetine 4-hydroxyatomoxetine plasma concentration 1073 ng/ml (4.2 _m) 54 ng/ml (0.2 _m) 9.4 ng/ml (0.03 _m) 3283 ng/ml (12.9 _m) 1518 ng/ml (6.3 _m) 3.1 ng/ml (0.01 _m) fit of the data to conventional inhibition (competitive or mixed com- petitive/noncompetitive) relationships (segel, 1975) using winnon- lin professional version 2.1 (pharsight, mountain view, ca) as de- scribed in detail by ring et al. (1996). these data were used to guide the choice of in vivo drug-drug interaction studies by predicting the possible effect of atomoxetine on the metabolism of coadministered drugs that are substrates of these cytochromes p450. the relation- ship (i/(i _ ki)) _ 100 was used to calculate an estimate of expected percentage of inhibition (segel, 1975). in this formula, i was the potential inhibitor concentration of atomoxetine or metabolite, and ki was the previously determined kinetic constant. to predict the maximal potential for drug-drug interactions, a conservative ap- proach using total drug concentration (table 1) instead of free drug concentration was used as the inhibitor concentration even though both atomoxetine (98.7% bound) and n-desmethylatomoxetine (99.1% bound) are highly bound to human albumin (sauer et al., 2003). maximal plasma concentrations of atomoxetine, n-desmethylato- moxetine and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine (table 1) from a multiple dose pharmacokinetic study in eight em and six pm adult subjects were used to predict the degree of in vivo inhibition. although the maxi- mal recommended dose of atomoxetine is 1.2 mg/kg/day, a conserva- tive approach was used and the concentrations of atomoxetine and its metabolites at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg/day were used for the predic- tions. in vivo probe drug studies in healthy subjects subjects. the desipramine probe drug study was conducted at the lilly laboratory for clinical research (indianapolis, in). proto- col and informed consent documents were approved by the institu- tional review board of indiana university (purdue university at indianapolis). the midazolam probe drug study was conducted at ppd development, inc. (austin, tx). protocol and informed consent documents were approved by research consultantsÃ review com- mittee (austin, tx). both studies were conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki. all participants provided informed writ- ten consent before enrollment into the study. all volunteers were considered to be healthy on the basis of medical history, physical examination, electrocardiographic findings, and routine clinical lab- oratory tests. volunteers with clinically abnormal results were ex- cluded from the study. cyp2d6 em and pm subjects, as determined by genotyping and phenotyping analyses, were entered in the desi- pramine and midazolam studies, respectively. determination of cyp2d6 genotype. cyp2d6 genotype anal- ysis was performed by genaissance pharmaceuticals, inc. (formerly dna sciences) (morrisville, nc). cyp2d6 genotype was evaluated by testing for the nonwild-type (pm) alleles *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, and *8. if patients were homozygous for any combination of these alleles, a pm genotype was assigned; otherwise, an em genotype was as- signed. briefly, dna from whole blood samples were isolated and purified using the gentra puregene dna isolation kit and analyzed for cyp2d6 genotype using a validated pcr method. the presence of the cyp2d6 alleles *3, *4, *6, *7, and *8 was determined using multiplex pcr. the first round amplification generates a 1578-base pair product containing the five alleles. the 1578-base pair product serves as the template for a multiplex allele-specific assay to simul- taneously identify the five alleles. the first round pcr template is added to two separate master mixes containing primers that recog- nize wild-type or mutant alleles. these primers produce pcr prod- ucts of 1394-, 1010-, 304-, 219-, and 167-base pairs in length for *7, *3, *4, *8, and *6 alleles, respectively. for wild-type genotypes, pcr products occur in the wild-type lanes, whereas no pcr products are observed in the mutant lane. for heterozygous genotypes, pcr prod- ucts of the same fragment size occur in both the wild-type and mutant lanes. for mutant genotypes, pcr products occur only in the mutant lane. the cyp2d6 Ã*5Ã allele results from a complete dele- tion of the cyp2d6 gene. a long-range pcr method is used to identify a deletion of the cyp2d6 locus. presence or absence of pcr products identifies the wild-type, heterozygous mutant, or homozy- gous mutant alleles. after electrophoresis, gels are photographed under ultraviolet light and the appropriate genotype is assigned. design of desipramine probe drug study. this study was an open-label, one-sequence crossover, repeated dose drug interaction study in healthy adult men and women characterized as cyp2d6 em subjects. in period 1, each subject received a single 50-mg oral dose of desipramine (norpramin) alone on study day 1. blood sam- ples for pharmacokinetic analysis of desipramine were collected be- fore dosing desipramine, and then 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h postdose. in period 2, the first six subjects received 40 mg of atomoxetine b.i.d.. because the doses for the first six subjects were well tolerated in combination with desipramine, the remaining 16 subjects received 60 mg of atomoxetine b.i.d. subjects were maintained on 40 or 60 mg of atomoxetine for 13 days to maintain atomoxetine exposure during the elimination of desipra- mine. on day 4 of atomoxetine administration, subjects received a single 50-mg oral dose of desipramine with the morning dose of atomoxetine. blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of desipra- mine were collected before dosing desipramine, and then 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, and 216 h postdose. blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of atomoxetine were collected after the morning oral dose of atomoxetine on the day before desipramine administration and the day of desipramine administra- tion (before dosing atomoxetine and then 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h postdose). design of midazolam probe drug study. the study was an open-label, one-sequence crossover, replicated design drug interac- tion study in healthy men and women characterized as cyp2d6 poor metabolizers. a replicate design was used to enhance the power due to the difficulty in recruiting pm subjects. in period 1, each subject received a single 5-mg oral dose of midazolam (versed;

(2003). for desipramine, plasma was analyzed using a validated gas chro- matographic/nitrogen phosphorus detector method at ppd develop- ment (richmond, virginia). the dynamic range for the assay was 0.5 to 100 for desipramine. the intra/interassay precision and accuracy ranged from 6.61 to 9.31% and 3.88 to 7.29%, respectively. plasma concentrations of midazolam were analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry method at taylor technology, inc. the dynamic range for the assay was 0.5 to 100 ng/ml for midazolam. the intra/interassay precision and accuracy ranged from 1.53 to 15.6% and _3.60 to 3.20%, respectively. pharmacokinetic analysis. pharmacokinetic parameter esti- mates for midazolam and desipramine were calculated with noncom- partmental analysis by using winnonlin professional version 2.1 (pharsight, mountain view, ca). the maximum plasma concentra- tion (cmax), corresponding time of the maximum concentration (tmax), terminal half-life (t1/2), area under the plasma concentration time curve (auc0-t), extrapolated to infinite time (auc0-_), apparent clearance (cl/f) and apparent volume of distribution (vz/f) were calculated. the pharmacokinetic evaluation of the steady-state atomoxetine, n-desmethylatomoxetine, and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine plasma con- centration data used noncompartmental pharmacokinetic methods of analysis. the minimum plasma concentration (css, min), maximum plasma concentration (css, max), corresponding times of the maximal concentration (tmax), area under the plasma concentration time curve (auc0-_) over the 12-h dosing interval (_), average steady-state plasma concentration (css, avg), apparent plasma clearance at steady state (clss/f), and apparent volume of distribution (vz/f) were cal- culated. statistical analysis. a comparison of plasma pharmacokinetics of the probe drugs (desipramine and midazolam) alone and coadmin- istered with atomoxetine was performed with cmax, auc0-t, auc0-_, and tmax. a similar comparison was made for atomoxetine pharma- cokinetics with and without desipramine coadministered. all statis- tical analyses used sas version 6.12. besides tmax, all analyses were carried out with a mixed effect analysis of variance on log-transformed values. geometric means, ratio of geometric means, 90% confidence intervals of the ratio, and p values for the hypothesis of no treatment difference were calcu- lated. for tmax comparisons, treatment medians, the median of paired differences and the p value for the hypothesis of no treatment difference were calculated. the p value was calculated with wilcoxon signed rank test. a similar statistical approach was used for both the midazolam and desipramine interaction studies. the model, including treat- ment as a fixed effect and subject as a repeated factor, was used for inhibition and induction of p450 by strattera 413 analysis. the maximum likelihood method of estimation and satter- thwaiteÃs degree of freedom method were used. the determination of whether atomoxetine is a significant in vivo inhibitor of cyp3a or cyp2d6 was made primarily based on the ratio of geometric means and the 90% confidence intervals for auc of midazolam or desipramine. if the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means of auc was contained within the bound- aries of 0.8 and 1.25, atomoxetine was not considered a significant inhibitor of cyp2d6. additionally, if the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means of auc for midazolam was contained within the boundaries of 0.74 to 1.35 and the p value for the null hypothesis that the treatments are equivalent is _0.1, atomoxetine was not considered a significant inhibitor of cyp3a. the predefined boundaries of midazolam are wider than the typical 0.8 to 1.25 boundaries due to fairly high variability in midazolam pharmacoki- netics and the smaller sample size due to recruitment of poor me- tabolizer subjects.

11	Carbamazepine but not valproate induces bupropion metabolism.	Bupropion (BUP) may be less likely than other antidepressants to cause switches into mania and rapid cycling, suggesting utility in bipolar disorder. The combination of BUP with the mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants carbamazepine (CBZ) or valproate (VPA) is a strategy that might further lessen the risk of mania. CBZ induces, and to a lesser extent VPA inhibits the hepatic metabolism of various medications, but their effects on BUP have not been previously studied. Inpatients with mood disorders had pharmacokinetic profiles of BUP and metabolites assessed after single, oral, 150-mg doses of BUP while receiving placebo (N = 17) or during chronic blind CBZ (N = 12) or VPA (N = 5) monotherapy. CBZ but not VPA therapy decreased BUP peak concentrations (Cmax) by 87% (p < 0.0001) and 24-h area under the curve (AUC) by 90% (p < 0.0001), threohydrobupropion Cmax by 81% (p <0.0009) and AUC by 86% (p < 0.002), and erythropydrobupropion Cmax by 86% (p < 0.05) and AUC by 96% (p < 0.05). CBZ increased hydroxybupropion (H-BUP) Cmax by 71% (p < 0.007) and AUC by 50% (p < 0.09) and H-BUP AUC by 94% (p < 0.02). Thus, CBZ markedly decreased BUP and increased H-BUP concentrations, whereas VPA did not affect BUP but increased H-BUP concentrations. Further studies are required to determine how these differential effects of CBZ and VPA on BUP pharmacokinetics influence the tolerability and efficacy of combination therapies with these agents.	methods patients meeting dsm iii r criteria major affective disorders admitted 3 west clinical research unit biological psychiatry branch national institute mental health bethesda maryland patients volunteered participate clinical research program gave oral written informed consent clinical trials cbz vpa bup well medications associated research procedures a thorough medical neurologic history examination pretreatment electroencephalogram done rule presence seizure disorders medical illnesses a detailed life course illness visually plotted quantified patient previously described psychiatric diagnoses confirmed schedule affective disorders schizophrenia structured diagnostic interview thus patients carefully characterized primary mood disorders purpose assessing clinical responses medications lacking concurrent medical disorders could alter pharmacokinetics patients nursing staff blind chronic medications well pharmacokinetic study drug administered order allow objective assessment clinical responses the blind condition also maintained patients nurses blind cbz vpa concentrations drawn throughout hospitalization even times patients receiving either drug patients 24 hour pharmacokinetic profiles bup metabolites single oral doses bup mg receiving placebo n chronic cbz n vpa n monotherapy patients cbz vpa least weeks order allow dosage titration attainment steady state well full induction hepatic metabolism cbz the placebo cbz vpa groups differ significantly respect mean age placebo cbz vpa gender placebo eight men nine women cbz seven men five women vpa two men three women seven patients placebo cbz studies four patients placebo vpa studies patients cbz received mean dose mg day mean trough cbz concentration plasma micro gram ml patients vpa received mean dose mg day mean trough vpa concentration plasma micro gram ml single trough cbz vpa concentrations plasma determined week kinetic study patient agents for pharmacokinetic study single oral dose bup mg administered a m blind fashion patients nothing mouth p m night hours receiving blind bup dose point resumed blinded placebo cbz vpa usual oral intake food fluids patients receiving cbz vpa three four divided doses day missed single morning dose cbz vpa concentrations agents plasma maintained kinetic studies blood samples ml collected hours receiving bup dose blood collected heparinized tubes immediately placed ice within hours centrifuged plasma removed frozen degrees celsius samples subsequently transported dry ice burroughs wellcome laboratory concentrations bup metabolites assayed sensitive specific reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography laboratory staff blind whether patients also receiving placebo cbz vpa the data analyzed unpaired two tailed t tests compare means measures across subgroups paired two tailed t tests used compare means measures individuals paired pharmacokinetic studies placebo cbz vpa pearson correlation coefficients used assess relationships quantitative measures the trapezoidal rule used compute 24 hour areas curve bup metabolites four primary outcome measures defined bup peak concentration cmax bup area curve auc h bup cmax https sslvpn pitt edu spa danainfo ovidsp tx ovid com ovidweb cgi ovid carbamazepine valproate induces bupropion metabolism page h bup auc in view lesser activity t bup e bup pharmacokinetic parameters metabolites considered primary outcome measures with four primary outcome measures bonferroni correction multiple eight total four cbz vs placebo four vpa vs placebo comparisons significance threshold p limits type error means standard deviations differences reported p values facilitate data interpretation	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
12	Celecoxib inhibits metabolism of cytochrome P450 2D6 substrate metoprolol in humans.	In vitro data have shown that celecoxib inhibits the metabolism of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 substrates. However, very limited data are available on the influence of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors on the disposition of CYP2D6 substrates in humans. Therefore the objective of this study was to examine the effect of celecoxib and rofecoxib on the pharmacokinetics of the clinically relevant CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol. An open, randomized, 3-period crossover study was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers. Metoprolol (50 mg) was given in all 3 periods without or after 7 days of pretreatment with celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) or rofecoxib (25 mg daily) to achieve steady-state conditions of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors in periods 2 and 3. Celecoxib significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of metoprolol from 271 to 414 micro g. h/L (64% +/- 57%, P <.001) and by more than 200% in 1 volunteer. The extent of this drug interaction was more pronounced in volunteers with 2 fully functional alleles compared with volunteers with 1 fully functional allele (103% +/- 75% versus 36% +/- 23%, P <.05). After administration of celecoxib, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol decreased significantly from 474 to 387 micro g. h/L (P <.01). Rofecoxib caused no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. We conclude that celecoxib inhibits the metabolism of the CYP2D6 substrate metoprolol but that rofecoxib does not. Clinically relevant drug interaction may occur between celecoxib and CYP2D6 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index.	methods subjects study design twelve male volunteers mean

13	Change from the CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer to the poor metabolizer phenotype during treatment With bupropion.	Some data indicate that bupropion inhibits the cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP2D6, but very little published data is available on the extent of this inhibition. The objective of the present study was to quantify this inhibition in a subject treated with bupropion for smoking cessation. Genotypically, the patient was a CYP2D6 homozygous extensive metabolizer (EM). His CYP2D6 phenotype was assessed using the test drug dextromethorphan before, during, and after treatment with bupropion. During treatment with bupropion, he clearly changed from the EM to the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype. Although the results from a single patient should be interpreted with great caution, the extent of the interaction indicates that bupropion might be a CYP2D6 inhibitor as potent as the most powerful CYP2D6 inhibitors known, such as quinidine and paroxetine.	a healthy 33 year old man treated bupropion smoking cessation he take received september accepted october address correspondence reprint requests olav spigset department clinical pharmacology university hospital n 7006 trondheim norway e mail olav spigset legemidler no therapeutic drug monitoring lippincott williams wilkins inc philadelphia medications his cyp2d6 genotype investigated allele specific polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism described previously found homozygous extensive metabolizer em genotype his cyp2d6 phenotype determined using probe drug dextromethorphan given oral dose mg treatment bupropion after dose dextromethorphan urine collected hours analyzed duplicate dextromethorphan metabolite dextrorphan described previously using method antimode em poor metabolizer pm phenotypes the first test carried days start bupropion treatment the second test carried treatment bupropion mg d days shortly thereafter bupropion discontinued adverse effects restlessness insomnia the third test carried weeks treatment bupropion terminated patient stopped smoking the phenotyping results presented figure	PK Trial	Special PK Trial	Phenotyped PK Trial	1	3	3
14	Cimetidine interaction with amitriptyline.	The interaction of cimetidine with amitriptyline was assessed by means of amitriptyline and nortriptyline plasma concentration measurements, standing blood pressure and pulse rate, digit symbol substitution, and visual analogue scales. Cimetidine increased plasma amitriptyline concentrations and decreased plasma nortriptyline concentrations, apparently by inhibiting presystemic metabolism. The changes in blood pressure, pulse rate and digit symbol substitution correlated with changes in concentrations of amitriptyline in plasma and expected changes based on a dose ranging preliminary experiment. Changes in subjective ratings of effects correlated with changes in nortriptyline concentrations in plasma.	our subjects ten healthy men age range 21 40years within normal range weight height they screened means history physical examination blood chemistry hematology all drug free non smokers ingestion alcohol permitted h prior investigation in preliminary experiment subjects given mg doses amitriptyline following overnight fast in main experiment subject studied two occasions on occasion pretreatment one capsule coded medication every h h starting day additionally single dose amitriptyline rag taken a m day coded medication either cimetidine rag matching placebo amitriptyline s k brand amitriptyline mg tablets if active coded medication used occasion i placebo used occasion ii vice versa the coded medication randomized administered double blind equal number subjects received two treatments first this projects approved local institutional review board informed consent obtained subjects blood samples collected intervals h post amitriptyline dosage plasma analysis amitriptyline nortriptyline blood pressure measured mercury sphygmomanometer blood pressure pulse rate measured twice dosage min collection post dosage blood sample one measurement made time point the subjects standing two minute equilibration period readings time maximum blood pressure pulse rate change studied supine 12 h point measurements point onwards standing a digit symbol substitution test battery visual analogue scales applied min pre dosage h post dosage in digit symbol substitution test subjects required decode number s yanbol pairs sequentially min correct substitutions comprised score a different number symbol code used test time the items battery visual analogue scales marked follows drowsy alert mentally slow quick witted well coordinated clumsy lethargic energetic tense relaxed the scales evaluated lengths mm ends subjects marks thus example length recorded mm normality lessened subject became drowsy mentally slow well coordinated lethargic tense amitriptyline nortriptyline concentrations measured high pressure liquid chromatography hplc using standard approaches analysis carried microparticulate silica column mobile phase consisting acetonitrile containing methanol ammonium hydroxide butylamine linear calibration curves ranging ng ml obtained compounds using uv absorbance detection nm the lower limit detection ng ml amitriptyline nortriptyline extracting ml plasma the metabolites 10 hydroxy amitriptyline 10 hydroxy nortriptyline determined coelute compounds interest coefficient variation figures replicate amitriptyline assays ranged standardization conducted daily plasma concentration data evaluated time maximum recorded concentration tmax maximum recorded concentration cpma half life h post dosage to area curve auc auc amitriptyline included extrapolation infinity using formula ct 0 693 c h plasma concentration amitriptyline auc this done nol riptyline auc 0_48 calculated statistical analysis empolyed analysis variance designed identify differences treatments times subjects t tests unrelated samples determine significant differences paired means a level ofp taken indicate significance throughout	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
15	Cimetidine interaction with imipramine and nortriptyline.	The interaction between cimetidine and two tricyclic antidepressants was examined in healthy subjects. One tricyclic, imipramine, is primarily metabolized to a demethylated active metabolite, desipramine. The other, nortriptyline, is largely metabolized to a 10-hydroxylated metabolite. It was assumed that pretreatment with cimetidine, because of its inhibition of metabolic pathways of both demethylation and hydroxylation as well as its ability to reduce hepatic extraction of these drugs, would increase bioavailability and decrease clearance of both drugs. Such was the case with imipramine, but the bioavailability of nortriptyline was not increased. Further, the bioavailability of the 10-hydroxy metabolite of nortriptyline was increased rather than decreased. The degree of change in these kinetic variables varied widely between individuals. Thus it is not possible to predict which subjects might develop evidence of toxicity to tricyclics when cimetidine is added to the treatment program. The monitoring of tricyclic plasma concentrations is probably desirable in such circumstances.	experimental procedures our subjects group six healthy men ranging age yr weight kg each tested two occasions without pretreatment cimetidine mg cimetidine four times daily two days mg morning test randomized sequence an oral dose mg tricyclic given blood samples drawn periodically next hr imipramine nortriptyline measured gas liquid chromatograph nitrogen sensitive detector plasma immediately separated blood samples kept frozen analysis required 2 ml sample the extraction procedure similar proposed walle ehrsson 2 tenacious binding drugs plasma required introduction 60 min boiling water bath protein denaturation step initial part procedure all glassware washed chromic acid silanized standard curves set use spiked samples containing ng drug measured internal standard usually another tricylic compound both standard curves sample levels calculated absolute recovery relative internal standard analysis done gas liquid chromatograph equipped dual nitrogen phosphorous flame ionization detector automatic sampler the on column injection glass column mm clin pharmacol ther february packed gp sp 2250 db moderately polar packing the retention times drugs min duplicate samples within ng ml imipramine plasma concentrations fitted twoor one compartment open model first order absorption extended least squares nonlinear regression computer program elsfit i7 since cases measurement points absorption phase attain satisfactory fit p used get better estimate overall plasma t1 2s t1 2 2 a the area time concentration curve hr auc 72 calculated trapezoidal method as residual auc small imipramine exactly calculable nortriptyline auc 72 used calculations apparent oral clearance volume distribution vd calculated assuming extent absorption f remained unchanged for statistical comparisons wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test twotailed used	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
16	Clarithromycin pharmacokinetics in healthy young and elderly volunteers.	The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin and its active 14(R)-hydroxy metabolite were assessed in 12 healthy young and 12 healthy elderly volunteers after oral administration of a multiple dose regimen of oral clarithromycin (500 mg every 12 hours for 5 doses). Plasma and urine clarithromycin and 14(R)-hydroxyclarithromycin concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The elderly subjects exhibited significantly elevated clarithromycin peak (Cmax) and trough (Cmin) plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) compared with young subjects. In addition, the elderly group exhibited a significantly reduced apparent total body clearance (300 +/- 97 versus 476 +/- 112 mL/min, respectively) and renal clearance (CLR) (84 +/- 31 versus 168 +/- 35 mL/min, respectively). Similar results were noted for the 14(R)-hydroxy metabolite, with significantly elevated Cmax, Cmin, and AUC and reduced CLR in the elderly compared with the young group. Because the differences in parent and metabolite pharmacokinetic parameters were small and the increase in circulating drug concentrations was well tolerated (no increase in incidence or severity of adverse events), adjustments in clarithromycin dosing regimens may not be necessary solely on the basis of age.	methods twelve healthy enrolled formed human ange department free state south healthy

17	Coadministration of nefazodone and desipramine: a pharmacokinetic interaction study.	To determine the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between nefazodone (NFZ), and desipramine (DMI). A single center, open-label, multiple-dose, parallel-group pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 28 healthy male and female subjects. Group A received DMI 50 mg/day for 2 days followed by DMI 75 mg/day for the next 17 days. On Days 10-14, subjects also received 100 mg NFZ twice daily, and during Days 15-19, the NFZ dose was increased to 150 mg twice daily. Group B received 100 mg NFZ twice daily for 5 days followed by 150 mg NFZ twice daily for the next 14 days. On Days 11-12, subjects also received 50 mg DMI and during Days 13-19, the DMI dose was increased to 75 mg daily. Serial blood samples were collected for Group A and Group B. Plasma concentrations of NFZ and its metabolites, mCPP, hydroxynefazodone (OH-NFZ), and triazoledione, DMI, and the DMI metabolite, 2-hydroxydesipramine (2-OH-DMI) were determined. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the addition of NFZ to DMI did not result in any significant changes in the AUC(0-12), Cmax, or tmax of either DMI or 2-OH-DMI. Addition of DMI to NFZ resulted in statistically significant increases of 40% in the AUC(0-12) and 42% in the Cmax of mCPP. A significant decrease in the AUC(0-12) (19%) of OH-NFZ also was observed. The increase in mCPP may be attributable to inhibition of mCPP metabolism by DMI. Overall, the combined administration of DMI and NFZ appeared to be safe and well tolerated in both treatment groups.	subjects methods this single center open label multiple dose parallel group study

18	Coadministration of short-term zolpidem with sertraline in healthy women.	This study was undertaken to determine whether there are pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between zolpidem, a hypnotic, and sertraline, an antidepressant. Twenty-eight healthy female volunteers received a single dose of zolpidem alone and five consecutive dose(s) of zolpidem 10 mg in the presence of chronic doses (19 days) of sertraline 50 mg. Using HPLC, plasma levels of zolpidem, sertraline, and N-desmethylsertraline were determined at different times throughout the study and PK parameters derived. Compared to zolpidem alone, the T 1/2 of the first dose of zolpidem in the presence of sertraline was reduced, the Cmax of the fifth zolpidem dose in the presence of sertraline was significantly increased, and its Tmax was significantly reduced. After five doses of zolpidem, the AUC of sertraline (-6%) and the Cmax of N-desmethylsertraline (+13%) were changed. There were no next-day effects of zolpidem on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and both drugs were well tolerated. Overall, coadministration of sertraline 50 mg and zolpidem 10 mg appears to be safe in healthy females but could result in a shortened onset of action and increased effect of zolpidem.	meth ods sub

19	Comparative CYP3A4 inhibitory effects of venlafaxine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and nefazodone in healthy volunteers.	An antidepressant for use in the patient receiving concomitant drug treatment, over-the-counter medications, or herbal products should lack cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4 inductive or inhibitory activity to provide the least likelihood of a drug-drug interaction. This study addresses the potential of 4 diverse antidepressants (venlafaxine, nefazodone, sertraline, and fluoxetine) to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. In a 4-way crossover design, 16 subjects received clinically relevant doses of venlafaxine, nefazodone, or sertraline for 8 days or fluoxetine for 11 days. Treatments were separated by a 7- to 14-day washout period and fluoxetine was always the last antidepressant taken. CYP3A4 activity was evaluated for each subject at baseline and following each antidepressant using the erythromycin breath test (EBT) and by the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam (ALPZ) after 2-mg dose of oral ALPZ. Compared to baseline, venlafaxine, sertraline, and fluoxetine caused no apparent inhibition or induction of erythromycin metabolism (P > 0.05). For nefazodone, a statistically significant inhibition was observed (P < 0.0005). Nefazodone was also the only antidepressant that caused a significant change in ALPZ disposition, decreasing its area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC; P < 0.01), and increasing its elimination half-life (16.4 vs. 12.3 hours; P < 0.05) compared with values at baseline. No significant differences were found in the pharmacokinetics of ALPZ with any of the other antidepressants tested. These results demonstrate in vivo that, unlike nefazodone, venlafaxine, sertraline, and fluoxetine do not possess significant metabolic inductive or inhibitory effects on CYP3A4.	methods this was an open-label, crossover study designed to compare the effects of 4 antidepressants on the activity of cyp3a4. subjects received each antidepressant for 8 days, except for fluoxetine, which was administered for 11 days. treatment with each antidepressant was followed by cyp3a4 profiling and a 7- to 14-day washout period prior to starting the next antidepressant. the design is summarized in table 1 into 10 active study periods and 3 washout periods. human subjects eligible subjects were healthy male volunteers be- tween the ages of 18 and 55. only subjects who were within 25% of their ideal body weight, as established by the metropolitan life insurance company tables, were eligible for study participation. no concomitant medications, botan- ical preparations, or other dietary supplements were allowed during the study and caffeine was not allowed on the days of cyp3a4 probe drug administration. all subjects were nonsmokers and used no alcohol during the study. health status was established with a physical examination and medical history, a biochemical laboratory screen, including a urine drug toxicology screen, and an electrocardiogram. all subjects were excluded who had been treated within 1-month prior to the study with known drugs capable of inducing or inhibiting cyp enzymes. subjects were phenotyped with dextromethorphan prior to entering the study to exclude cyp2d6-poor metabolizers.24 the study objectives were to table 1. design of open-label crossover study study period study day or length activity 1 2 3 4 washout 5 6 washout 7 8 washout 9 10	DDI Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	0	2	2
20	Comparative pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin when coadministered with cytochrome P450 inhibitors.	Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins) are first-line treatments for hypercholesterolemia. Although exceedingly well tolerated, treatment with statins incurs a small risk of myopathy or potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis, particularly when coadministered with medications that increase their systemic exposure. Studies compared the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin when coadministered with 4 inhibitors of cytochrome P450-3A4 isoenzymes in healthy subjects. Compared with pravastatin alone, coadministration of verapamil, mibefradil, or itraconazole with pravastatin was associated with no significant changes in pravastatin pharmacokinetics. However, concomitant verapamil increased the simvastatin area under the concentration:time curve (AUC) approximately fourfold, the maximum serum concentration (C(max)) fivefold, and the active metabolite simvastatin acid AUC and C(max) approximately four- and threefold, respectively (all comparisons p <0.001). Similar (greater than fourfold) important increases in these parameters and a >60% increase in the serum half-life (p = 0.03) of atorvastatin were observed when coadministered with mibefradil. The half-life of atorvastatin also increased by approximately 60% (p = 0.052) when coadministered with itraconazole, which elicited a 2.4-fold increase in the C(max) of atorvastatin and a 47% increase in the AUC (p <0.001 for C(max) and AUC). Clarithromycin significantly (p <0.001) increased the AUC (and C(max)) of all 3 statins, most markedly simvastatin ( approximately 10-fold increase in AUC) and simvastatin acid (12-fold), followed by atorvastatin (greater than fourfold) and then pravastatin (almost twofold). Pravastatin has a neutral drug interaction profile relative to cytochrome P450-3A4 inhibitors, but these substrates markedly increase systemic exposure to simvastatin and atorvastatin.	methods

21	Comparison of midazolam and simvastatin as cytochrome P450 3A probes.	Our objective was to compare simvastatin with the validated probe midazolam in the assessment of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activity. This study used an open-label, fixed-sequential, 3-way crossover study design. Nineteen subjects received oral doses of 0.075 mg/kg midazolam and 40 mg simvastatin during 3 phases (baseline, after inhibition with 400 mg ketoconazole for 10 days, and after induction with 600 mg rifampin [INN, rifampicin] for 9 days). Serial plasma concentrations of midazolam and simvastatin were obtained. Oral clearances of midazolam and simvastatin were compared. Oral midazolam clearance decreased after pretreatment with ketoconazole (from a geometric mean of 25 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 12-57 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)] to 2.7 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 1.2-8.5 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001) and increased after pretreatment with rifampin (to a geometric mean of 203 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 125-371 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001). Oral simvastatin clearance decreased after ketoconazole (from a geometric mean of 312 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 151-1478 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)] to 25 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 8.0-147 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001) and increased after rifampin (to a geometric mean of 3536 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 413-10,329 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001). The change in simvastatin clearance was highly variable from baseline to inhibition (6- to 33-fold decrease) and from baseline to induction (2- to 39-fold increase) compared with midazolam (7- to 18-fold decrease during inhibition and 4- to 12-fold increase during induction). Midazolam and simvastatin oral clearances were correlated for all study phases (r = 0.5 and P = .03 for baseline and r = 0.53 and P = .02 for inhibition) but were weakest for induction (r = -0.031, P = .22). The area under the concentration-time curve inhibitory ratio for midazolam was 9.4 versus 12.4 for simvastatin (r = 0.3, P = .03). Compared with midazolam, simvastatin is a nonvalidated, suboptimal probe for studying CYP3A drug interactions because of its lack of CYP3A specificity.	methods the clinical protocol was approved by the institu- tional review board of the mary imogene bassett hospital, cooperstown, ny. all subjects gave written informed consent before undergoing any study-related procedures. subjects. twenty nonsmoking, healthy white adults (10 men and 10 women) were enrolled. sub- jects were required to have a body mass index (weight [in kilograms]/height [in square meters]) be- tween 18 and 30 kg/m2 and to be in good health as determined by complete medical history, social his- tory, physical examination, standard 12-lead electro- cardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests. pregnant or nursing women, postmenopausal women, and women of childbearing potential who were unwilling or un- able to use an acceptable method of contraception at least 14 days before and until 30 days after the completion of the study were excluded. the use of prescription and nonprescription drugs including vi- tamins and dietary or herbal supplements was pro- hibited. herbal supplements had to be discontinued 30 days before study start. hormonal methods of contraception were prohibited for 7 days or 5 half- lives, whichever was longer, before study start. con- sumption of grapefruit juiceÃ, apple juiceÃ, or orange juiceÃ containing products was prohibited for 7 days before study start and for the duration of the study. study used an open-label, Ãxed-sequential, 3-way crossover study design. the baseline phase occurred Ãrst, the inhibition phase took place second, and the induction phase was last. subjects were randomized with regard to the order of midazolam and simvastatin administration within each study phase. subjects participated in all 3 phases of the study and received a single oral dose of 0.075 mg/kg midazolam (2 mg/ml cherry-Ãavored midazolam syrup; roxane laboratories, columbus, ohio) and a single oral dose of 40 mg simvastatin (zocor; merck & co) during each phase as illustrated in the treatment schema (fig 1). study design. this study procedures. subjects arrived at the clinical research unit between 6 and 7 am on study days when the probe drug (midazolam or simvastatin) was admin- istered. intravenous catheters were placed in the fore- arm for serial blood sampling. in the baseline phase subjects received no pretreatment and were given the probe drugs 2 days apart (on day 1 and day 3). serial 7-ml blood samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 352 chung et al clinical pharmacology & therapeutics april 2006 time each day. ketoconazole and rifampin were pro- vided in blister packages that were returned for assess- ment of compliance. pharmacokinetic analysis. plasma from the 7-ml blood samples was harvested by centrifugation. plasma samples were stored at _80Â¡c until analysis. plasma concentrations of midazolam were analyzed at preva- lere life sciences (whitesboro, ny). samples were analyzed by atmospheric pressure chemical ionizationÃ liquid chromatographyÃtandem mass spectrometry as previously described.24,25 a solid-phase extraction method with alprazolam as the internal standard was used to isolate midazolam. a standard curve ranging from 0.25 to 100 ng/ml for midazolam was used before the analysis. the interassay precision was 9.89% or lower, with quality-control samples ranging up to 75.0 ng/ml. the interassay accuracy was within 106% to 109% for midazolam. plasma concentrations of simvastatin were analyzed at bioassay laboratory (houston, tex) via a liquid chromatographyÃtandem mass spectrometry method. in brief, simvastatin was extracted from quality-control and study samples with a liquid-liquid extraction method by use of mevastatin as the internal standard. a standard curve used before the analysis ranged from 0.1 to 80 ng/ml for simvastatin. the interassay precision ranged from 5.7% to 10.5%. the interassay accuracy was within 105% to 106% for simvastatin. plasma concentration versus time data were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis by use of winnonlin software, version 3.2 (pharsight, mountain view, calif). the auc extrapolated to inÃnity [auc(0-_)] was determined by the linear trapezoidal method with estimation of elimination half-life (t_) by linear regres- sion. oral clearance (cl/f) was calculated by the ratio of dose administered over auc(0-_) and normalized for weight. the dose for midazolam, 0.075 mg/kg, was adjusted for weight, and the dose for simvastatin was a Ãxed dose of 40 mg. auc(0-_), cl/f, maximum plasma concentration (cmax), and t_ are presented as geometric mean (range). presented cl/f was normal- ized for weight. the time to maximum plasma concen- tration (tmax) is presented as median and range. inhib- itory ratios are presented as geometric means. genotyping. five-milliliter whole-blood samples for deoxyribonucleic acid isolation were obtained during the baseline study phase in all subjects. sam- ples were analyzed for the alleles cyp3a4_1b and cyp3a5_1b, _1c, _2, _3, _3b, and _6 at gentris (morrisville, nc). human genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was puriÃed from whole blood, and amplicons were generated by polymerase chain reaction ampli- fig 1. schema of study design. the probe drug administered was either 0.075 mg/kg oral midazolam or 40 mg oral sim- vastatin. 4, and 6 hours after midazolam dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 hours after simvastatin dosing. during the inhibition phase, subjects were pretreated with 400 mg oral ketoconazole once a day (two 200-mg tablets; taro pharmaceuticals, hawthorne, ny) for 10 days, and then the probe drugs were administered 3 days apart, on day 6 and day 9. serial 7-ml blood samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 30 hours after midazolam dosing and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 30 hours after simvastatin dosing. during the induction phase, subjects were pretreated with 600 mg oral ri- fampin once a day (two 300-mg capsules; udl labo- ratories, rockford, ill) for 9 days, and then the probe drugs were administered 1 day apart, on day 8 and day 9. serial 7-ml blood samples were collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 hours after midazolam dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after simvastatin dosing. during all study phases, subjects remained seated for at least 2 hours after the administration of either probe drug. subjects were monitored by pulse oximetry and measurement of vital signs for at least 2 hours after midazolam administration. subjects fasted for at least 8 hours before dosing of either probe drug. during the baseline phase, subjects continued to fast for an addi- tional 4 hours after probe administration. during the inhibition and induction phases, subjects were given ketoconazole or rifampin in the fasted state 2 hours after administration of the probe drug. subjects contin- ued to fast for an additional 4 hours after the adminis- tration of ketoconazole or rifampin. during the inhibition and induction phases, doses of ketoconazole and rifampin were given on an outpatient basis. subjects were instructed to take ketoconazole or rifampin once a day in the morning around the same clinical pharmacology & therapeutics 2006;79(4):350-61 midazolam and simvastatin as cyp3a probes 353 Ãcation based on the region of interest for each speciÃc locus. the polymerase chain reaction prod- ucts were puriÃed and desalted by use of qiagen qiaquick columns (qiagen, valencia, calif) and analyzed by use of an electronically addressable nanochip microarray (nanogen, san diego, calif). for each locus and each sample, a speciÃc capture oligonucleotide was electronically addressed to 2 pads on the microarray followed by the ampliÃed product. allele-speciÃc reporter probes were pas- sively hybridized to the microarray. one reporter speciÃc to wild-type sequence was labeled with cy3, whereas the probe speciÃc to the mutation of interest was labeled with cy5. after thermal denaturation, only the allele-speciÃc reporter remained. fluores- cence was quantiÃed after laser induction and nor- malized to a standard, and the ratio of cy3 to cy5 was used to determine the genotype. the presence of both cy3 and cy5 signal (a ratio near 1) indicated a heterozygote. the presence of only 1 signal (a ratio _ 5 or _0.2) indicated a homozygote. statistical analysis. by use of an _ of .05, _ of .20 (power of 80%), and 3 treatment phases (baseline, inhibition, and induction), it was estimated that a sample size of 20 would be able to detect at least a 25% difference in midazolam and simvastatin auc(0-_) between phases. statistical data were an- alyzed by use of sas software, version 8 (sas institute, cary, nc). data were log-transformed be- fore analyses. pearson correlation coefÃcients (r) were used to describe the strength of association of pharmacokinetic parameters and inhibitory ratios be- tween midazolam and simvastatin during each phase. comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters for mi- dazolam and simvastatin between study phases were analyzed by use of a paired student t test because the intent was to compare baseline with each individual phase (inhibition and induction). comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters between men and women were made by use of an unpaired student t test. p _ .05 was considered statistically signiÃcant.

22	Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine extended release and desvenlafaxine in extensive and poor cytochrome P450 2D6 metabolizers.	The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of cytochrome P450 2D6 extensive metabolizer (EM) or poor metabolizer (PM) status on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of venlafaxine extended release (ER) and desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate) in healthy adults. In an open-label, crossover study, 14 healthy volunteers (aged 18-55 years; 7 EMs and 7 PMs) received, in randomized sequence, single doses of venlafaxine ER 75 mg/d or desvenlafaxine 100 mg/d. Cytochrome P450 2D6 genotyping was performed, and plasma drug levels were measured. The arithmetic means and standard deviation (SD) for area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) were calculated. Comparisons of AUC and Cmax between cytochrome P450 2D6 EMs and PMs were calculated using a Wilcoxon exact test. After administration of venlafaxine ER, mean Cmax and AUC of venlafaxine were significantly greater in PMs compared with EMs, whereas mean Cmax and AUC of its metabolite, desvenlafaxine, were significantly lower for PMs than for EMs (P = 0.001, all comparisons). In contrast, mean Cmax and AUC of desvenlafaxine after administration of desvenlafaxine were comparable between EMs and PMs. Cytochrome P450 2D6 genetic polymorphisms had no discernible impact on exposure to desvenlafaxine after desvenlafaxine administration; in contrast, compared with an EM phenotype, a PM phenotype had a significant effect on venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine plasma concentrations after venlafaxine ER administration. This reduced pharmacokinetic variability of desvenlafaxine may translate into better uniformity of response for patients receiving desvenlafaxine versus venlafaxine, but additional studies are required to test this hypothesis.	methods and materials this single center randomized open label 2 period crossover study conducted cyp2d6 ems pms based genotyping the protocol investigator s brochure

23	Comparison of verapamil, diltiazem, and labetalol on the bioavailability and metabolism of imipramine.	Twelve healthy male subjects completed this randomized, placebo controlled, four-period crossover trial to determine the effect of verapamil, diltiazem, and labetalol on the bioavailability and metabolism of imipramine. Subjects received a 7-day course of one of four treatments; verapamil (120 mg every 8 hr), diltiazem (90 mg every 8 hr), labetalol (200 mg every 12 hr), or placebo (every 12 hr) during each study period. Imipramine (100 mg) was administered orally on the morning of day 4 of each study period. Plasma and urine samples were collected periodically over the ensuing 96 hours. Samples were assayed by HPLC for imipramine, desipramine, 2-hydroxyimipramine, and 2-hydroxydesipramine. Verapamil, diltiazem, and labetalol increased imipramine area under the plasma concentration time curve (relative bioavailability) as compared with placebo by 15%, 30%, and 53%, respectively. Verapamil and diltiazem did not demonstrate consistent changes in the formation of the measured metabolites. Labetalol caused a significant decrease in the amount of imipramine metabolized to 2-hydroxyimipramine (mean decrease: 22%) and from desipramine to 2-hydroxydesipramine (mean decrease: 8%). The molar ratios of plasma AUC of 2-hydroxyimipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine to the parent compounds were significantly decreased. Since these metabolic processes are dependent on the cytochrome P450IID6 isozyme, these data suggest that labetalol decreases the oral clearance of imipramine by inhibiting this system. All three of these commonly used agents decreased the oral clearance of imipramine. These drug interactions could lead to elevated imipramine concentrations and have the potential for clinically important adverse events.	methods study design results thirteen ages weight period 12 lead tion tests tory urinalysis study postural egg gies prescription days the university written subject protection subjects healthy participated crossover nonsmoking within study medical electrocardiogram serum including men placebo controlled physical ecg eligibility history chemistry ideal body four determined examina labora hematology subjects pr interval excluded hypotension ingested medications study approved rights milliseconds drug prescription history within human alleror non14 preceding committee subjects medicine north informed randomly carolina consent school entrance received obtained study following treat periods verapamil ments separate 7 day cns active agents calan g d searle hours diltiazem go chicago hc1 gardizem kansas hg1 trandate city mo glaxo every mg nc hours i week each period separated subjects abstained every research placebo mg inc hours il mg labla marion hours triangle tablet min alcoholic hours hc1 every oratories betalol park every imum beverages participants throughout began caffeine containing study study on taking period general treatment admitted products period medication evening clinical north day gcrc the fasted university overnight mg dose pressure administered heart hours on exactly randomized rate administration measured starting imipramine minutes imipramine hours dosing blood hours imipramine day day research carolina imipra hour treatment every continuing an egg samples adminispotassium ruther veniplasma frozen urine sam24 blood collected vacutainer becton intravenous ml dickinson catheter tubes centrifuged polypropylene interval time measured analysis analysis blood 5 ml c collected frozen supine administration subjects volunteers 24 hour blood position after allowed discharged urine hours total 30 ml subjects hours 6 hour eat collection taking remained sample imipcol ambulate on gcrc days vera either subjects continued diltiazem labetalol appropriate 96 hour standard placebo intervals returned sample sampling time function enough panel liver enzyme bilirubin determinations nj tubes morning i center hospitals mine blood minutes hours obtained every obtained tration edta ford puncture transferred ples volume aliquot fasting ramine lection freely though pamil gcrc lection at obtained cluding degrees sample analysis plasma sutfin imipramine droxyimipramine assayed method hplc hydroxyimipramine ng ml sensitivities dm15 metabolites desipramine 2 hydroxydesipramine urine jusko according utilizing fluorescence detection 18 imipramine 2 modified normal phase limit the lower ng ml ng ml 2 hydroxydesipramine standard curves prepared colblood 2 hywere downloaded jcp sagepub com univ of pittsburgh may hermann et al compounds enzymatically chemical standard ng ml variation plasma measured ng ml ine curase analysis ered metabolites efficient imipramine ng ml diltiazem pamil measurement sigma the concentration variation linear replicate ng ml metabolites determination plasma conjugated the imipramine coefficient metabolites deglucuronidated co curve range mo analysis st louis urine imipramine ng ml the ng ml replicate metabolites ng ml labetalol imipramine determinations ng ml interfere metabolites four urglubefore covits coof verawith data analysis time versus methods maximum pharmacokinetic metabolites tion dent time maximum rate nation terminal centration concentration using lated area determined versus parameters calculated using data maximum concentration imipramine plasma standard concentration tmaj the model terminal concentraindepen cma j taken observed calculated portion time versus linear last time values curve time trapezoidal point dividing plasma determining log area auc curve method extrapolated terminal elimislope con plasma calcu residual infinity elimina imipramine metabolic pathway imipramine 9c0 c c c n 2 oh imipramne c cn ch3 figure major metabolic pathway imipramine 149 j clin pharmacol desipramine ch3 i 2 oh desipramine oc ch3 ch downloaded jcp sagepub com univ of pittsburgh may imipramine interactions by verapamil diltiazem and labetalol rate oral renal tion tion the imipramine imipramine lated imipramine recovered statistical four sas analysis ment alpha 0 05 determine cant	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
24	Concomitant use of mirtazapine and cimetidine: a drug-drug interaction study in healthy male subjects.	The objective of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics and the tolerability/safety of mirtazapine and cimetidine separately and in combination following oral administration of multiple doses. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction study in 12 healthy male subjects. They received either cimetidine (800 mg b.i.d.) or placebo in combination with (commercially available, racemic) mirtazapine (30 mg nocte). Cimetidine and placebo were administered for 14 days, with mirtazapine added during days 6-12 of each period. Serial blood samples for kinetic profiling were taken on day 5 and day 12 for cimetidine and on days 12-14 for mirtazapine. The co-administration of cimetidine resulted in a statistically significant increase in the area under the curve (AUC(0-24)) and Cmax of mirtazapine (54% and 22% respectively). The AUC(0-24) of demethylmirtazapine increased only slightly, and there was no effect on Cmax. The elimination half-lives for both mirtazapine and its demethyl metabolite were unaffected by cimetidine co-administration. The trough and average plasma concentrations during the steady state were elevated during cimetidine treatment (62% and 54%, respectively). Mirtazapine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of cimetidine. Co-administration of cimetidine (800 mg b.i.d.) and mirtazapine (30 mg nocte) resulted in increased steady-state plasma levels of mirtazapine (C(ss,min) = +61%, P < 0.05; C(ss,av) = +54%, P < 0.05), probably as a result of increased bio-availability. The Cmax (+22%, P < 0.05) and AUC(0-24) (+54%, P < 0.05) also increased. Due to the variability of the mirtazapine plasma levels in patients, the clinical meaning of these increases is probably limited. Co-administration of mirtazapine did not alter cimetidine pharmacokinetics.	materials methods after approval obtained medical ethics committee university hospital utrecht university utrecht the

25	Contributions of CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 to the biotransformation of E- and Z-doxepin in healthy volunteers.	In-vitro data indicated a contribution of cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2, 3A4, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 to biotransformation of doxepin. We studied the effects of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 on E- and Z-doxepin pharmacokinetics in humans. Doxepin kinetics was studied after a single oral dose of 75 mg in healthy volunteers genotyped as extensive (EM), intermediate (IM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of substrates of CYP2D6 and of CYP2C19 and as slow metabolizers with the CYP2C9 genotype *3/*3. E-, Z-doxepin and -desmethyldoxepin were quantified in plasma by HPLC. Data were analyzed by non-parametric pharmacokinetics and statistics and by population pharmacokinetic modeling considering effects of genotype on clearance and bioavailability. Mean E-doxepin clearance (95% confidence interval) was 406 (390-445), 247 (241-271), and 127 (124-139) l h(-1) in EMs, IMs and PMs of CYP2D6. In addition, EMs had about 2-fold lower bioavailability compared with PMs indicating significant contribution of CYP2D6 to E-doxepin first-pass metabolism. E-doxepin oral clearance was also significantly lower in carriers of CYP2C9*3/*3 (238 l h(-1) ). CYP2C19 was involved in Z-doxepin metabolism with 2.5-fold differences in oral clearances (73 l h(-1) in CYP2C19 PMs compared with 191 l h(-1) in EMs). The area under the curve (0-48 h) of the active metabolite -desmethyldoxepin was dependent on CYP2D6 genotype with a median of 5.28, 1.35, and 1.28 nmol l h(-1) in PMs, IMs, and EMs of CYP2D6. The genetically polymorphic enzymes exhibited highly stereoselective effects on doxepin biotransformation in humans. The CYP2D6 polymorphism had a major impact on E-doxepin pharmacokinetics and CYP2D6 PMs might be at an elevated risk for adverse drug effects when treated with common recommended doses.	materials

26	CYP2D6 genotype in relation to perphenazine concentration and pituitary pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity in Asians: CYP2D6-serotonin-dopamine crosstalk revisited.	Hyperprolactinemia is a common side effect of first-generation antipsychotics mediated by antagonism of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the pituitary. Most first-generation antipsychotics are metabolized by CYP2D6 in the liver. Further, CYP2D6 is expressed in the human brain as a 5-methoxyindolethylamine O-demethylase potentially contributing to regeneration of serotonin from 5-methoxytryptamine. As dopaminergic neurotransmission is subject to regulation by serotonin, CYP2D6 may exert a nuanced (serotonergic) influence on dopaminergic tone in the pituitary. CYP2D6*10 is an allele associated with reduced enzyme function and occurs in high frequency (about 50%) in Asians. We prospectively evaluated significance of CYP2D6 genetic variation for prolactin response to perphenazine (a model first-generation antipsychotic) in Asians. A single oral dose of perphenazine (0.1 mg/kg) or placebo was administered to 22 medication-free nonsmoker healthy male Chinese-Canadian volunteers, following a double-blind within-subject randomized design. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h after drug administration. In volunteers with CYP2D6*10/CYP2D6*10 genotype, the mean area under curve (AUC0-6) for perphenazine concentration was 2.9-fold higher than those who carry the CYP2D6*1 allele (P<0.01). Notably, volunteers homozygous for CYP2D6*10 exhibited a significant reduction (66%) in mean pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity as measured by the (prolactin-AUC0-6/perphenazine-AUC0-6) ratio (P=0.02). CYP2D6 genotype is a significant contributor to perphenazine concentration in Chinese-Canadians. Importantly, prolactin response, when normalized per unit perphenazine concentration, appears to be blunted in volunteers homozygous for CYP2D6*10. We suggest that CYP2D6 genetic variation may potentially influence pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity in the pituitary, presumably through disposition of an endogenous substrate (e.g. 5-methoxytryptamine).	materials methods participants participants medication free healthy nonsmoker male volunteers chinese ancestry age years range years permanently resided greater toronto

27	CYP2D6 inhibition by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: analysis of achievable steady-state plasma concentrations and the effect of ultrarapid metabolism at CYP2D6.	To assess the correlation between plasma concentrations of four commonly administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the magnitude of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 inhibition. Prospective analysis. University-affiliated research laboratory. Thirty-two healthy, drug-free volunteers. Subjects were randomized to four groups and received daily administration of either fluoxetine 60 mg (as a loading dose), fluvoxamine 100 mg, paroxetine 20 mg, or sertraline 100 mg for 8 days. The urinary concentration ratio of dextromethorphan:dextrorphan (interpreted as an in vivo index of CYP2D6 activity) was determined for each subject before and after the 8 days of receiving SSRIs. Plasma SSRI trough concentrations were measured on days 6-9. The CYP2D6 genotype was determined in a subject with an undetectable paroxetine concentration. Inhibition of CYP2D6 correlated significantly with plasma concentrations of paroxetine and fluoxetine. In contrast, no significant correlations emerged between CYP2D6 inhibition and plasma concentrations of sertraline or fluvoxamine. The subject with an undetectable paroxetine concentration was found to carry at least three functional CYP2D6 genes. For paroxetine and fluoxetine, plasma concentrations and dosage strongly influence the magnitude of enzyme inhibition. The potential of paroxetine (a CYP2D6 substrate) as an inhibitor may be affected by the genotypes and metabolic capacities of individual subjects.	methods study entry criteria design subjects drug free healthy volunteers recruited among students staff campus university texas inclusion exclusion criteria described previously 7 all subjects extensive metabolizers subjects instructed avoid alcohol caffeine tobacco concurrent prescription nonprescription drugs entire study duration the study approved university s institutional review board written informed consent obtained subjects the dm dx phenotype assessment based administration dm mg 8 hour urine collection performed times average result used baseline dm dx ratio dm dxbaseline subjects randomized blocks eight receive once daily dosing ssri days fluoxetine mg day fluvoxamine mg day paroxetine mg day sertraline mg day the dm dx phenotype assessment repeated subjects day from departments pharmacology drs lam ereshefsky medicine dr lam psychiatry dr ereshefsky university texas health science center san antonio san antonio texas college pharmacy university texas austin austin texas drs lam ereshefsky section clinical pharmacology experimental therapeutics the children s mercy hospital kansas city missouri dr gaedigk food drug administration rockville maryland dr alfaro alamo mental health group san antonio texas dr simpson supported part research grant solvay pharmaceuticals marietta georgia address reprint requests y w francis lam pharm d department pharmacology university texas health science center san antonio floyd curl drive san antonio tx e mail lamf uthscsa edu dm dxday hours last ssri administration continued ssri compliance ensured daily investigator supervised administration blood samples determination ssri metabolite concentrations obtained mornings days immediately ssri administration day hours last ssri dose plasma aliquots frozen 86 c assayed all urine collections dm administration handled outpatient research clinic urine aliquots frozen 86 c assayed dm dx analysis drug concentration urine samples analyzed modification previously published high performance liquid chromatography hplc method 9 with exception using internal standard assay details quality control data similar described earlier the lower limit g ml used calculating dm dx ratios dm concentrations measurable no interfering peaks observed chromatograms ssri administration fluoxetine norfluoxetine sertraline desmethylsertraline paroxetine concentrations analyzed hplc ultraviolet detection nm the lower limit detection ng ml intra interassay coefficients variation cvs analytes plasma concentrations fluvoxamine determined capillary gas chromatography method electron capture detection the lower limit quantification ng ml 1 ml plasma sample the withinday between day cvs respectively concentrations ng ml 10 cyp2d6 genotype analysis the cyp2d6 genotype determined subject undetectable drug concentration receiving paroxetine the subject s family members also evaluated briefly genomic dna isolated whole blood using qiagen blood dna isolation kit qiagen valencia ca genotyping 2d6 performed blinded samples using long polymerase chain reaction pcr pcrrestriction fragment length polymorphism based procedures described previously 11 assays performed 2d6 2 long pcr cyp2d6 inhibition by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors lam et al used detect presence gene duplications multiplications this assay discriminate number duplicated multiplied gene copies data analysis statistical analysis performed statview version abacus concepts inc berkeley ca there several fold differences dm dx ratios extensivemetabolizer population large in addition normality assumption violated skewness kurtosis dm dxbaseline dm dxday percentage change dm dx ratio ssri concentrations four subject groups therefore log transformation ratios concentrations incorporated statistical analysis appropriate linear regression analyses used evaluate variables might affect dm dx ratios a p value less considered significant	PK Trial	Special PK Trial	Phenotyped PK Trial	1	3	3
28	Differential time course of cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme inhibition by fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine in healthy volunteers.	The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine, sertraline, and fluoxetine have varying degrees of potency in inhibiting the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme. However, the time course for maximum inhibition to occur or for inhibition to dissipate when dosing is discontinued, requires clarification. In an open label, parallel group study of 45 healthy volunteers, the time course of CYP2D6 inhibition of the above SSRIs was evaluated. Subjects were randomized to receive paroxetine at 20 mg/day for 10 days; sertraline at 50 mg/day for 3 days, followed by sertraline at 100 mg/day for 10 days; or fluoxetine at 20 mg/day for 28 days. CYP2D6 activity was assessed using the dextromethorphan metabolic ratio (DMR) on antidepressant days 5 and 10 for sertraline and paroxetine and at weekly intervals for fluoxetine. Following SSRI discontinuation, calculation of a CYP2D6 inhibition half-life (t(1/2)inh) revealed the time course of fluoxetine inhibition (t(1/2)inh = 7.0 +/- 1.5 days) to be significantly longer than either paroxetine (t(1/2)inh = 2.9 +/- 1.9) or sertraline (t(1/2)inh = 3.0 +/- 3.0) (p < 0.01), but the latter were not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05). Time for the extrapolated DMR versus time log-linear plots to return to baseline was significantly different between fluoxetine (63.2 +/- 5.6 days) and both paroxetine (20.3 +/- 6.4 days) and sertraline (25.0 +/- 11.0 days) (p < 0.01), making the rank order (from longest to shortest) of time for CYP2D6 inhibition to dissipate: fluoxetine > sertraline >or= paroxetine. Differences between mean baseline DMR values and measured values obtained after drug discontinuation for each drug group became nonsignificant on discontinuation day 5 for both paroxetine and sertraline and on discontinuation day 42 for fluoxetine. These data define the time course of a persistent effect that fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine have on CYP2D6 following drug discontinuation and should be considered when initiating therapy with a CYP2D6 substrate.	methods subjects a total aged years volunteers completed medical screening provided written informed consent participate study there male subjects female subjects of black asian white all subjects cyp2d6 extensive metabolizers determined phenotyping dextromethorphan healthy assessed history physical laboratory examination no female subjects pregnant subjects nonsmokers abstained use caffeine days cyp2d6 phenotyping performed subjects prohibited taking concurrent prescription over the counter preparations entire protocol subjects excluded study taking long term medications subjects monitored throughout study adverse effects drug administration sampling fifteen subjects randomized three drug treatment groups subjects three groups place one following dosing schedules paroxetine mg day days sertraline mg day days followed sertraline mg day days uoxetine mg day days the length dosing corresponded time estimated steady state conditions occur based respective reported elimination half lives 3 phenotyping cyp2d6 dextromethorphan performed baseline days medication paroxetine mg sertraline mg days uoxetine administration on days phenotyping conducted dextromethorphan administered time ssri dose cyp2d6 phenotyping repeated completion ssri administration discontinuation days paroxetine days sertraline days uoxetine phenotyping consisted administering mg oral dose dextromethorphan bladder void saving urinary output hours an aliquot urine analyzed hplc dextromethorphan metabolite dextrorphan a dmr less used antimode determining extensive metabolizer status analytical method dextromethorphan dextrorphan urine samples ml simultaneously determined validated reverse phase hplc modi ed method hoskins et al 19 dextromethorphan dextrorphan internal standard separated cyano column mm mobile phase containing acetonitrile m acetate buffer ph ow rate ml min fluorescence detection excitation wavelength nm emission wavelength nm optimized dextromethorphan used quantitate peak areas analytes the internal standard method used determine molar concentrations dextromethorphan dextrorphan urine sample the lower limit quantity ng ml dextromethorphan ng ml dextrorphan coef cients variation ranged quality control samples compound concentrations ng ml quality control samples placed throughout assay runs pharmacokinetic statistical analysis the program p pharm micropharm international champs france used estimate cyp2d6 inhibition half life t1 2inh following drug discontinuation three ssris the dmr substituted plasma concentration using mono exponential equation individual log linear plots constructed subject extrapolated baseline dmr values determine projected time true baseline values the mean values cyp2d6 inhibition half life days baseline compared analysis variance anova determine differences among drug treatment groups within group comparisons performed repeated measures anova determine differences dmr among values baseline steady state following drug discontinuation in addition post hoc analysis performed determine differences magnitude change dmr values among drug treatment groups various time points linear regression analysis carried determine correlation baseline dmr presumed steady state dmr three treatment groups the statistical program spss version spss inc chicago il utilized analyses level signi cance tests set p cytochrome p450 2d6 enzyme inhibition j clin psychopharmacol vol 22 no april	DDI Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	Non RCT Parallel Clinical Trial	0	2	4
29	Diltiazem enhances the effects of triazolam by inhibiting its metabolism.	Triazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4. Diltiazem is an inhibitor of this isozyme and interacts with midazolam, another substrate of this enzyme. Therefore the possible interaction between triazolam and diltiazem is worth investigation. A balanced, randomized, double-blind crossover study design was used, with an interval of 2 weeks between phases. Ten healthy volunteers were given 60 mg diltiazem orally or placebo three times a day for 2 days. On the second day they received a single 0.25 mg oral dose of triazolam, after which plasma samples were collected and effects of triazolam measured for up to 17 hours. Diltiazem increased the mean area under the triazolam concentration-time curve threefold (p < 0.001) and the elimination half-life (p < 0.001) and the peak plasma concentration of triazolam twofold (p < 0.005). The increased concentrations of triazolam during the diltiazem phase were associated with increased and prolonged pharmacodynamic effects. Diltiazem has a clinically significant interaction with oral triazolam. The data is highly suggestive that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of triazolam during the first-pass and elimination phases. Prescription of triazolam should be avoided if a patient is using diltiazem or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A.	methods study design ten young healthy volunteers seven women three men age range years weight range kg table i participated study gave written informed consent a clinical examination done 12 lead electrocardiogram monitored commence were good health none subjects taking continuous medication except two females subjects using contraceptive steroids the study approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki finnish national agency medicines a balanced randomized doubleblind crossover study design two phases intervals weeks used the subjects given oral doses either mg diltiazem dilzem orion ltd espoo finland placebo three times day days am pm 11 oo pm on second day pm subjects ingested mg table i characteristics subjects peak concentrations diltiazem mg three times day second day administration diltiazem subject no sex female female male female female female female female male male c rnax peak plasmaco ncentration dose triazolam halcion upjohn kalamazoo mich ml water the volunteers fasted hours administration triazolam light standard meal hours afterward subjects allowed ingest alcohol coffee tea cola test days tobacco also forbidden blood sampling determination plasma triazolam diltiazem blood sampled tubes contained ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid administration triazolam l 2 hours administration separated plasma stored c analysis plasma triazolam concentrations determined gas chromatography use modified method kroon et a1 9 gaillard et al the lower level detection method rig ml coefficient variation day day q ml n diltiazem concentrations determined hplc the coefficient variation day day rig ml n pharmacokinetics the pharmacokinetics triazolam characterized peak concentrations plasma c time c area triazolam plasma concentration time curves auc o 17 auc o w calculated trapezoidal rule elimination values pharmacodynamic measurements the effects triazolam performance measured time blood sampling six different tests digit symbol substitution test maddox wing test measuring coordination extraocular muscles critical flicker fusion test measuring discrimination fusion flickering red light feelings drowsiness use visual analog scale postural sway eyes open postural sway eyes closed i3 the subjects trained tests commencement trial for pharmacodynamic variable areas response time curves determined trapezoidal rule hours auc o 7 statistically andysis results expressed mean values sem the pharmacokinetic variables pharmacodynamic effects triazolam placebo diltiazem phases compared use student test paired values data analyzed statistical program systat windows version systat evanston ill the chosen level significance wasp	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
30	Diphenhydramine alters the disposition of venlafaxine through inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in humans.	CYP2D6 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of venlafaxine. Subjects with a low CYP2D6 activity have increased plasma concentrations of venlafaxine that may predispose them to cardiovascular side effects. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that diphenhydramine, a nonprescription antihistamine, can inhibit CYP2D6 activity. Therefore, the authors investigated in this study a potential drug interaction between diphenhydramine and venlafaxine. Fifteen male volunteers, nine with the extensive metabolizer (EM) and six with the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype of CYP2D6, received venlafaxine hydrochloride 18.75 mg orally every 12 hours for 48 hours on two occasions (1 week apart): once alone and once during the concomitant administration of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (50 mg every 12 hours). Blood and urine samples were collected for 12 hours under steady-state conditions. In EMs, diphenhydramine decreased venlafaxine oral clearance from 104+/-60 L/hr to 43+/-23 L/hr (mean +/- SD; p < 0.05) without any effect on renal clearance (4+/-1 L/hr during venlafaxine alone and 4+/-2 L/hr during venlafaxine plus diphenhydramine). In PMs, coadministration of diphenhydramine did not cause significant changes in oral clearance and partial metabolic clearances of venlafaxine to its various metabolites. Diphenhydramine disposition was only slightly affected by genetically determined low CYP2D6 activity or concomitant administration of venlafaxine. In conclusion, diphenhydramine, at therapeutic doses, inhibits CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of venlafaxine in humans. Clinically significant interactions could be encountered during the concomitant administration of diphenhydramine and other antidepressant or antipsychotic drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6.	methods study population fifteen healthy men (nine ems and six pms) partici- pated in the study. their mean (_sd) age was 27 _ 4 years and 27 _ 5 years, and their mean body weight was 71 _ 8 kg and 84 _ 11 kg for ems and pms, respectively (table 1). all volunteers were nonsmokers and healthy as determined by routine physical examination, elec- trocardiogram, and laboratory tests. the study was ap- proved by the ethics committee for human subjects of laval hospital, and written informed consent was ob- tained from each participant before the study. determination of cyp2d6 phenotype the cyp2d6 phenotype

recovery of dextromethorphan to that of its metabolite, dextror- phan, in an overnight urine collection after the oral ad- ministration of 30 mg of dextromethorphan hydrobro- mide (balminil dm, rougier inc., montreal, canada). dextromethorphan and dextrorphan urine concentra- tions were determined by high-performance liquid chro- matography (hplc) with Ãuorescence detection by us- ing a 5-_m zorbax phenyl column (chromatographic specialties, inc., brockville, canada) based on assays previously described.30, 31 all phenotypes were deter- mined when no other drug was coadministered. a ratio of urinary concentrations of dextromethorphan to dex- trorphan with an antimode of 0.3 was used to determine cyp2d6 phenotype. in all subjects, the cyp2d6 pheno- type corresponded to the cyp2d6 genotype (table 1). determination of cyp2d6 genotype the cyp2d6 genotype was determined in all sub- jects by using the polymerase chain reaction tech- nique. the dna was analyzed to determine the pres- ence of cyp2d6*3, cyp2d6*4, cyp2d6*5, cyp2d6*6, and cyp2d6*7 mutant alleles, as described previously (table 1).32Ã35 study design subjects received oral doses (n _ 5) of 18.75 mg ven- lafaxine hydrochloride (effexor, wyeth-ayerst canada, inc., montreal, canada) every 12 hours for 48 hours on two occasions: once alone and once during the concomi- tant administration of 50 mg of diphenhydramine hy- drochloride (benadryl, warner wellcome, scarborough, canada) every 12 hours. diphenhydramine was also 178 j clin psychopharmacol, vol 21/no 2, april 2001 lessard and colleagues administered alone and during concomitant administra- tion of venlafaxine. the three study arms were performed 1 week apart. venlafaxine tablets were prepared by the department of pharmacy, laval hospital, by cutting 37.5- mg venlafaxine hydrochloride tablets in half. no other drugs, caffeine-containing foods or beverages, chocolate, or alcohol were allowed 48 hours before and during the study. on the morning of each study day, after an overnight fast, subjects were admitted to the clinical re- search unit of laval hospital, and an intravenous catheter was inserted in a forearm vein. blood samples (10 ml) were obtained before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after venlafaxine administration, diphenhy- dramine administration, or both, with 100 ml of water. blood was collected in glass tubes containing edta (va- cutainer, becton dickinson, franklin lakes, nj), and plasma was separated by centrifugation and frozen at _80_c until analyzed. heparin was used to prevent catheter occlusion, and the Ãrst 3 ml of each blood sam- ple was discarded. two hours after administration of ven- lafaxine, subjects were allowed to take a light snack (juice and mufÃns). urine was collected up to 12 hours after dosing. the urinary ph and volume were recorded, and aliquots were stored at _80_c. plasma and urine concentrations of venlafaxine and its metabolites plasma concentrations of venlafaxine were deter- mined by hplc with Ãuorescence detection by using maprotiline (sigma, st. louis, mo) as the internal stan- dard.36 the minimum measurable concentration was 10 pmol/ml when 1.5 ml of plasma was used. interday and intraday variations were less than 10%. urine concentrations of venlafaxine, nodv, odv, and ndv were determined from aliquots of pooled sam- ples collected from 0 to 12 hours, before and after en- zymatic hydrolysis with _-glucuronidase type h1 2000 u/ml (sigma). urine concentrations of venlafaxine, nodv, odv, and ndv were determined by hplc with Ãuorescence detection, whereas those of the internal standard were determined by ultraviolet detection (de- tector spd 6-a, shimadzu, tokyo, japan) at 260 nm, ac- cording to the assay previously described.19 interday and intraday variations were less than 10%. plasma and urine concentrations of diphenhydramine and its metabolites plasma concentrations of diphenhydramine (sigma) and n-desmethyldiphenhydramine (parke-davis, ann arbor, mi) were determined on the basis of the assay de- scribed by webb and eldon.37 in brief, plasma samples (1 ml) were processed by using a liquid-liquid extrac- tion procedure. after a back-extraction with 125 _l of o-phosphoric acid 0.05%, 75 _l of the residue was ana- lyzed by hplc with Ãuorescence detection. plasma samples were analyzed for diphenhydramine and n- desmethyldiphenhydramine with a c8 column (zorbax sb-c8, 150 _ 4.6Ãmm inner diameter, 5 _m, chromato- graphic specialties, brockville, ontario, canada), and the mobile phase was nah2po4 50 mm/acetonitrile (69: 31) adjusted at ph 4 with phosphoric acid and circu- lated at a Ãow rate of 1.3 ml/min. interday and intraday variations were less than 10%. urine concentrations of diphenhydramine, n-des- methyldiphenhydramine, n,n-didesmethyldiphenhydra- mine, and diphenhydramine n-oxide were determined from aliquots of pooled samples collected from 0 to 12 hours before and after enzymatic hydrolysis with _-glu- curonidase type h1 2000 u/ml (sigma). hydrolysis was performed at 37_c for 18 hours to release the com- pounds from their conjugates. in brief, 0.5-ml urine sam- ples, spiked with 500 ng orphenadrine (internal stan- dard; sigma) and saturated with nacl, were extracted with 5 ml of diethyl ether after the addition of 0.4 ml naoh. other steps in the extraction procedure were similar to those for plasma samples, except that the back extraction was performed with 300 _l o-phosphoric acid 0.05%. concentrations of n,n-didesmethyldiphen- hydramine and diphenhydramine n-oxide were esti- mated by using a coefÃcient of Ãuorescence response similar to those of n-desmethyldiphenhydramine and diphenhydramine, respectively. interday and intraday variations were less than 10%. the analysis of diphenylmethoxyacetic acid (gift of dr. wayne riggs, faculty of pharmaceutical science, ubc, vancouver, canada) was based on a method previously published.38 for quantiÃcation of diphenylmethoxyacetic acid, 0.5-ml urine samples were extracted after enzy- matic hydrolysis with _-glucuronidase. after addition of 0.4 ml hcl 1 n and 2 _g of ketoprofen (internal standard), samples were extracted twice with 5 ml of diethyl ether. the combined organic layer was evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, the residue was dissolved with 200 _l of water, and 50 _l of the resultant was injected into the hplc system, which consisted of a c18 column (ultrasphere ods, 250 _ 4.6Ãmm inner diameter, 5 _m, beckman instruments, inc., fullerton, ca). the mobile phase was nah2po4 50 mm/acetonitrile/triethylamine (60: 40:0.03) adjusted at ph 3 with phosphoric acid and circu- lated at a Ãow rate of 2 ml/min. urine concentrations of diphenylmethoxyacetic acid were determined by Ãuores- cence with emission and excitation wavelengths set at 220 nm and 285 nm, respectively, whereas amounts of the internal standard (ketoprofen) were determined by ultra- violet detection at 280 nm. venlafaxine-diphenhydramine pharmacokinetic interaction j clin psychopharmacol, vol 21/no 2, april 2001 179 data analysis oral clearance of venlafaxine and diphenhydramine were calculated as d/auc0Ã_, where d corresponds to the dose of venlafaxine or diphenhydramine, auc refers to the area under the plasma concentrationÃtime curve of venlafaxine, and _ was Ãxed at 12 hours. auc0Ã_ was calculated by using the linear trapezoidal rule for ascending data and the log-trapezoidal rule for descending data.39 renal clear- ance (clr) was calculated as the ratio of the amount of unchanged venlafaxine or diphenhydramine (ae0Ã12) ex- creted over 12 hours to the auc of venlafaxine or diphenhydramine over the same time interval (auc0Ã12). metabolic clearance (clmet) of diphenhydramine was calculated as the difference between total clearance and renal clearance: clmet _ (d _ f/auc0Ã_) _ clr, where bioavailability (f) was Ãxed at 0.72 and d corre- sponds to the dose of diphenhydramine (base form).40, 41 partial metabolic clearances of venlafaxine for the se- quential metabolic pathways leading to the formation of odv and nodv or of ndv and nodv were calculated as partial metabolic clearance to o-demethylated metabolites _ (aeodv and _ aenodv / 2)/auc0Ã_ partial metabolic clearance to n-demethylated metabolites _ (aendv _ aenodv / 2)/auc0Ã_, where ae is the amount of metabolites excreted in urine over 12 hours and auc0Ã_ is area under the plasma con- centrationÃtime curve of venlafaxine from 0 to 12 hours.19 partial metabolic clearance of diphenhydramine to n- demethylated metabolites was calculated as the ratio of the amount of n-desmethyldiphenhydramine _ n,n- didesmethyldiphenhydramine excreted over 12 hours to the auc of diphenhydramine over the same time interval (auc0Ã12). partial metabolic clearance of diphenhy- dramine to diphenhydramine n-oxide and to diphenyl- methoxyacetic acid was calculated as the amount of each metabolite excreted over 12 hours to the auc of diphen- hydramine over the same time interval (auc0Ã12). partial metabolic clearance of n-desmethyldiphenhydramine to n,n-didesmethyldiphenhydramine was calculated as the amount of n,n-didesmethyldiphenhydramine excreted over 12 hours to the auc0Ã12 of n-desmethyldiphenhy- dramine. the amount of the metabolites, as well as the dose of venlafaxine or diphenhydramine, was expressed in molar units. fractional urinary recovery was calcu- lated by dividing the amount of the parent drug or its metabolites recovered in urine over the oral dose (molar unit) administered. statistical analysis representative measures were expressed as mean _ sd. two approaches were performed to analyze data, the Ãrst one being the comparison between ems and pms for venlafaxine or diphenhydramine parameters with and without concomitant administration of the other drug. the statistical method used to perform this analysis was a cross-nested analysis of variance with one factor repre- senting the group effect, one factor representing the sub- jects (this factor is nested within the factor group be- cause ems were different from pms), and the other factor representing coadministration of the other drug. because the interaction between phenotype and concomitant ad- ministration of venlafaxine or diphenhydramine was sig- niÃcant for almost all variables, separate analyses were performed for each phenotype by using a randomized block design. normality and variance assumptions were tested. the results were considered signiÃcant if p values were _ 0.05. the data were analyzed with the statistical package program sas (sas institute, inc., cary, nc).

31	Disposition and biotransformation of the antipsychotic agent olanzapine in humans.	Disposition and biotransformation of the new antipsychotic agent olanzapine (OLZ) were studied in six male healthy volunteers after a single oral dose of 12.5 mg containing 100 microCi of [14C]OLZ. Biological fluids were analyzed for total radioactivity, the parent compound (GC/MS), and metabolites (electrospray LC/MS and LC/MS/MS). Mean radiocarbon recovery was approximately 87%, with 30% appearing in the faces and 57% excreted in the urine. Approximately half of the radiocarbon was excreted within 3 days, whereas > 70% of the dose was recovered within 7 days of dosing. Circulating radio-activity was mostly restricted to the plasma compartment of blood. Mean peak plasma concentration of OLZ was 11 ng/ml, whereas that of radioactivity was 39 ng eq/ml. Mean plasma terminal elimination half-lives were 27 and 59 hr, respectively, for OLZ and total radioactivity. With the help of NMR and MS data, a major metabolite of OLZ in humans was characterized as a novel tertiary N-glucuronide in which the glucuronic acid moiety is attached to the nitrogen at position 10 of the benzodiazepine ring. Another N-glucuronide was detected in urine and identified as the quaternary N-linked 4'-N-glucuronide. Oxidative metabolism on the allylic methyl group resulted in 2-hydroxymethyl and 2-carboxylic acid derivatives of OLZ. The methyl piperazine moiety was also subject to oxidative attack, giving rise to the N-oxide and N-deemethyl metabolites. Other metabolites, including the N-deemethyl-2-carboxy derivative, resulted from metabolic reactions at both the 4' nitrogen and 2-methyl groups. The 10-N-glucuronide and OLZ were the two most abundant urinary components, accounting for approximately 13% and 7% of the dose, respectively. In fecal extracts, the only significant radioactive HPLC peaks were due to 10-N-glucuronide and OLZ representing, respectively, approximately 8% and 2% of the administered dose. Semiquantitative data obtained from plasma samples from subjects given [14C]OLZ suggest that the main circulating metabolite is 10-N-glucuronide. Thus, OLZ was extensively metabolized in humans via N-glucuronidation, allylic hydroxylation, N-oxidation, N-dealkylation and a combination thereof. The 10-N-glucuronidation pathway was the most important pathway both in terms of contribution to drug-related circulating species and as an excretory product in feces and urine.	materials methods

32	Disposition of fluvoxamine in humans is determined by the polymorphic CYP2D6 and also by the CYP1A2 activity.	Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used widely in the treatment of depression and other psychiatric diseases, but little is known about the specific isozymes involved in its metabolism. This study investigated the relationship between fluvoxamine disposition and the polymorphic CYP2D6 and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (as contained in cigarette smoke) inducible CYP1A2. Fluvoxamine (50 mg orally) was given to 10 extensive metabolizers and four poor metabolizers of debrisoquin, and concentrations were assessed in plasma by high performance liquid chromatography. Five of the extensive metabolizers and one of the poor metabolizers were smokers of more than 10 cigarettes per day. The CYP1A2 activity was determined by means of a urinary caffeine test. Compared with nonsmoking extensive metabolizers, nonsmoking poor metabolizers had a statistically significant (p = 0.02, Mann-Whitney U test) about twofold higher maximum plasma concentration, longer half-life, and fivefold lower oral clearance of fluvoxamine. The oral clearance of fluvoxamine correlated to the CYP1A2 index in the 14 subjects (rs = 0.58; p < 0.05; Spearman rank correlation). The disposition of fluvoxamine in humans is associated with the polymorphic CYP2D6 activity, but CYP1A2 also seems to be involved.	methods subjects the study performed according helsinki declaration

33	Dose of midazolam should be reduced during diltiazem and verapamil treatments.	1. The effects of diltiazem and verapamil on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam were investigated in a double-blind randomized cross-over study of three phases. 2. Nine healthy volunteers were given orally diltiazem (60 mg), verapamil (80 mg) or placebo three times daily for 2 days. On the second day they received a 15 mg oral dose of midazolam, after which plasma samples were collected and performance tests carried out for 17 h. 3. The area under the midazolam concentration-time curve was increased from 12 +/- 1 microgram ml-1 min to 45 +/- 5 micrograms ml-1 min by diltiazem (P < 0.001) and to 35 +/- 5 micrograms ml-1 min by verapamil (P < 0.001). The peak midazolam concentration was doubled (P < 0.01) and the elimination half-life of midazolam prolonged (P < 0.05) by both diltiazem and verapamil treatments. 4. These changes in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam were also associated with profound and prolonged sedative effects. 5. If the administration of midazolam cannot be avoided, the dose of midazolam should be reduced during concomitant treatment with diltiazem and verapamil.	methods nine healthy female volunteers aged years weighing kg participated study each subject ascertained good health medical history clinical examination 12 lead electrocardiogram entering study six subjects using contraceptive steroids the subjects continuous medications the study protocol approved ethics committee department correspondence dr janne backman department clinical pharmacology university helsinki paasikivenkatu sf 00250 helsinki finland janne t backman et al clinical pharmacology helsinki university central hospital all subjects gave written informed consent full explanation protocol participating study study design a randomized double dummy cross over design three treatment phases used the phases separated interval least days the subjects received three pretreatments mg diltiazem dilzem mg tabl orion pharmaceutical company ltd espoo finland mg verapamil verpamil mg tabl orion pharmaceutical company ltd matched placebo three times daily days total five doses the pretreatment doses administered h h first day h h h second day a 12 lead electrocardiogram done subjects three times pretreatment look possible cardiac conduction abnormalities on second day subjects ingested mg midazolam dormicum mg tablets hoffmann la roche ltd basel switzerland ml water h i e h previous administration diltiazem verapamil placebo the volunteers fasted h administration midazolam light standard meal h afterwards they allowed smoke ingest alcohol coffee tea cola test days determination ofplasma midazolam diltiazem verapamil on second day pretreatment forearm vein cannulated plastic cannula timed samples ml drawn edta tubes immediately administration midazolam h plasma separated within min stored c analysis plasma midazolam concentration determined specific gas chromatographic method np detection using methoxydiazepam internal standard the sensitivity method ng ml coefficient variation mean ng ml n mean ng ml n plasma diltiazem concentrations determined using high performance liquid chromatography the coefficient variation method mean ng ml n plasma verapamil concentrations quantified high performance liquid chromatographic method the coefficient variation mean ng ml n k determined regression analysis loglinear part curve the elimination half life t l calculated in2 k the areas diltiazem verapamil concentration time curves auc 0 17 h calculated using trapezoidal rule pharmacodynamic measurements the effect midazolam performance assessed blood sampling time using performance tests the volunteers trained tests ten times two separate days study the maddox wing test used measure coordination extraocular muscles the result expressed heterophoria diopters the number digits correctly substituted simple symbols min recorded digit symbol substitution test dsst seventeen mm long horizontal visual analogue scales vas used record subjective effects the opposing ends scales subject s native language alertdrowsy muzzy clearheaded well coordinated clumsy lethargic energetic contented discontented troubled tranquil mentally slow quick witted tense relaxed attentive dreamy incompetent proficient antagonisticfriendly interested bored withdrawn sociable good very bad performance subjective drowsiness alert drowsy used primary result sideeffects taken questionnaire strong feeble calm excited happy sad for pharmacodynamic variable areas response time curves determined trapezoidal rule h auc 0 7 h h auc 0 17 h the maximum effects emax h also registered statistical analysis the pharmacokinetic variables areas response time curves maximum effects midazolam three different pretreatments compared using analysis variance followed tukey s test tukey s test also used compare performance test results treatments different time points midazolam administration the correlation auc 0 17 h diltiazem verapamil change pharmacokinetic variables midazolam evaluated using pearson s correlation coefficient all data analysed use systat system statistics results expressed mean values s e mean the chosen significance level p pharmacokinetics the areas midazolam concentration time curves auc 0 oo calculated using trapezoidal rule extrapolation infinity peak concentrations cmax concentration peak times tmax midazolam also registered the terminal log linear phase plasma concentration time curve identified visually subject the elimination rate constant	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
34	Dose-related reduction in bupropion plasma concentrations by ritonavir.	The effect of repeat oral doses of ritonavir, at high (600 mg twice daily) and low (100 mg twice daily) doses, on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of bupropion was evaluated in healthy volunteers. Subjects received a single dose of 150 mg of bupropion on day 1 and twice-daily ritonavir from day 8 through day 30. Ritonavir was up-titrated from 300 mg twice daily to 600 mg twice daily in the high-dose ritonavir study, whereas subjects remained on 100 mg twice-daily ritonavir in low-dose ritonavir study. Subjects received a second single dose of bupropion on day 24. Serial blood samples were obtained to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its metabolites on days 1 and 24. Steady-state ritonavir led to a decrease of area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration of bupropion by 62% to 67% in the high-dose study and by 21% to 22% in the low-dose study, indicating a drug interaction of statistical and clinical significance, particularly at high doses of ritonavir. These studies demonstrate that the reduction of bupropion exposure by ritonavir is dose-related. Dosage adjustment of bupropion may be needed when administered with ritonavir. However, the maximum recommended daily dose of bupropion should not be exceeded.	methodssubjectsprotocol wxl103106 was conducted at ppd inc inaustin, texas, from may 2005 to august 2005, andprotocol wxl108712 was conducted at buffaloclinical research center in buffalo, new york, fromseptember 2006 to november 2006. wxl103106was approved by research consultants reviewcommittee, austin, texas, and wxl108712 byintegreview, austin, texas. all volunteers signedthe informed consent form before participating inthe study.healthy male (wxl103106 and wxl108712) andfemale (wxl103106) volunteers 18 to 55 years ofage were eligible for enrollment if they were in goodhealth as determined by medical and psychiatrichistory,physical examinations, clinical laboratorytests, vital signs, and body mass index between 18and 30 kg/m2. subjects were excluded if they hada history of seizure disorder, brain injury or anycondition that predisposes to seizure, diagnosis ofanorexia nervosa or bulimia, eating disorder, orhypersensitivity to study medications. subjects witha history of heavy alcohol consumption, defined asan average of 7 drinks per week (1 drink = 5 ouncesof wine or 12 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of hardliquor) or more within 6 months of screening, wereexcluded. subjects were excluded from the study ifthey were smokers or used any prescription or nonprescriptiondrugs within 14 days or 5 half-lives(whichever was longer) prior to the first dose ofstudy medication. subjects were not allowed to takeany medications during the study period except foracetaminophen (Â²2 g/d), fiber laxatives (wxl103106only), and oral contraceptives (wxl103106 only).subjects were also required to abstain from ingestinggrapefruit-containing products from at least 14 daysbefore dosing start until collection of the final pharmacokineticsample.study designtwo separate, but essentially identical protocols,wxl103106 and wxl108712, tested the effects ofhigh and low doses of ritonavir, respectively. bothprotocols had an open-label, 2-period, sequentialtreatment design. in period 1, subjects received asingle dose of 150 mg of extended-release bupropion(wellbutrin xl; glaxosmithkline, researchtriangle park, nc) 1 hour after breakfast on day 1.serial blood samples were obtained over 7 days toevaluate the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and itsmetabolites. in period 2, subjects received twicedailyritonavir (norvir; abbott, north chicago, ill)for 23 days, from day 8 through day 30, accordingto the treatment summary (table i). ritonavir dosewas up-titrated from 300 mg twice daily duringperiod 2 to maximize the tolerability at the highest dose (to 600 mg twice daily over 10 days) inwxl103106, whereas subjects remained on 100 mgtwice-daily ritonavir in study wxl108712 becausetolerability was not an issue at this dose. subjectsreceived a second single dose of bupropion 1 hourafter breakfast on day 24, and serial blood sampleswere obtained over 7 days to evaluate the pharmacokineticsof bupropion and its metabolites.ritonavir was administered twice daily at the beginningof a meal (breakfast and dinner). subjectsreceived fixed-calorie meals throughout the treatmentperiods.blood samplingvenous blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysisof bupropion and its metabolites (hydroxybupropion,threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion)were obtained at the same prespecifiedtimes on day 1 and day 24: predose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hourspostdose. in wxl103106, blood was drawn at 2additional time points, 16 and 36 hours postdose ondays 1 and 24. blood samples (5 ml) for measurementof plasma concentrations of bupropion and itsmetabolites (hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion,and erythrohydrobupropion) were collectedand processed as described previously.7drug and metabolite assaysplasma bupropion, hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion,and erythrohydrobupropion concentrationswere determined by glaxosmithkline(philadelphia, pa) using a validated analyticalmethod based on solid phase extraction, followed byhigh-performance liquid chromatography/tandemmass spectrometry analysis.7 the higher limit ofquantification was 1000 ng/ml for bupropion, threohydrobupropion,and erythrohydrobupropion and4000 ng/ml for hydroxybupropion. the highestaverage within-run precision was 5.2% and thehighest between-run precision was 6.2% for bupropion.the highest average within-run precision was4.5% and the highest between-run precision was5.6% among the three metabolites.sample size estimationbased on the largest intrasubject coefficient of variationof 21% for bupropion maximum plasma concentration(cmax), a sample size of 22 evaluable subjectswas estimated for study wxl103106 to provide 90%power to establish the lack of an interaction betweenritonavir and bupropion with _ = .05. as an interactionbetween ritanovir and bupropion had alreadybeen established in study wxl103106, studywxl108712 was not powered to demonstrate a lack ofinteraction; rather, a sample size of 16 evaluable subjectswas considered appropriate to estimate the magnitudeof the interaction with the necessary precision.data analysisbupropion and metabolite (hydroxybupropion,threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion)plasma concentration-time data were analyzedby standard noncompartmental methods usingwinnonlin professional edition 4.1 (pharsightcorporation, mountain view, calif) as describedpreviously.7 all calculations were based on actualsampling times.for the assessment of the interaction effect ofritonavir on bupropion pharmacokinetics, the ratioof bupropion area under the concentration-timecurve extrapolated to the last measurable concentration(auc(0-t)), area under the concentration-timecurve extrapolated to infinity (auc(0-Â°)), and maximumplasma concentration (cmax) in the presenceand absence of ritonavir was analyzed by analysis ofvariance (anova). the anova used a mixedeffectsmodel on log-transformed data with subjectas a random effect and treatment as a fixed effect.the bupropion-alone treatment was considered thereference treatment and the bupropion and ritonavirÃcombined administration was considered thetest treatment. the magnitude of the interaction wasassessed as the ratio of geometric mean of test-toreference,along with the 90% confidence intervalsof the ratio.

35	Drug interaction between oral atorvastatin and verapamil in healthy subjects: effects of atorvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of verapamil and norverapamil.	It has been reported that verapamil and atorvastatin are inhibitors of both P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and verapamil is a substrate of both P-gp and CYP3A4. Thus, it could be expected that atorvastatin would alter the absorption and metabolism of verapamil. The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil and one of its metabolites, norverapamil, were compared after oral administration of verapamil (60 mg) in the presence or absence of oral atorvastatin (40 mg) in 12 healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetics of verapamil were significantly altered by the coadministration of atorvastatin compared with those of without atorvastatin. For example, the total area under the plasma-concentration time curve to the last measured time, 24 h, in plasma (AUC(0-24) (h)) of verapamil increased significantly by 42.8%. Thus, the relative bioavailability increased by the same magnitude with atorvastatin. Although the AUC(0-24) (h) of norverapamil was not significantly different between two groups of humans, the AUC(0-24) (h, norverapamil)/ AUC(0-24) (h, verapamil) ratio was significantly reduced (27.5% decrease) with atorvastatin. The above data suggest that atorvastatin could inhibit the absorption of verapamil via inhibition of P-gp and/or the metabolism of verapamil by CYP3A4 in humans.	materials methods chemicals verapamil norverapamil atorvastatin propranolol hydrochloride internal standard high performance liquid chromatographic hplc analysis verapamil norverapamil purchased sigma aldrich corporation st louis mo usa verapamil capsule conventional fast release form mg atorvastatin tablet mg purchased yungjin corporation seoul south korea pfizer corporation seoul south korea respectively other chemicals reagent hplc grade subjects twelve healthy male korean volunteers age range years weight range kg height range cm participated study table they good health determined medical history physical examination electrocardiogram clinical laboratory measurements serum levels glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase sgot glutamic pyruvic transaminase sgpt creatinine table informed consent obtained subject explaining nature purpose study the protocol subject age years height cm weight kg sgot u l sgpt u l serum creatinine mg dl mean sd sgot serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase sgpt serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase sd standard deviation eur j clin pharmacol approved institutional review board irb institute bioequivalence bridging study chonnam national university gwangju south korea oral administration verapamil without atorvastatin in early morning forearm vein cannulated three way stopcock hyupsung medical seoul south korea a heparinized nacl injectable solution u ml flushed prevent blood clotting each volunteer received oral dose mg one capsule verapamil n 6 without n 6 mg 1one capsule atorvastatin ml water standard crossover model randomized order there 1 week washout period doses a blood sample approximately ml collected control h oral administration verapamil a heparinized nacl injectable solution u ml ml injected blood sampling after centrifugation blood sample 1 ml aliquot plasma samples stored c freezer ilshin lab yangju south korea used hplc analysis verapamil norverapamil blood pressure pulse rate measured brachium begining end experiments hplc assay plasma concentrations verapamil norverapamil determined using reported hplc method in brief 40 l aliquot propranolol hydrochloride ng ml internal standard 20 l aliquot 2 n sodium hydroxide ml diethylether added 0 2 ml aliquot plasma sample the mixture stirred min centrifuged rpm min the 1 ml aliquot organic layer transferred clean test tube evaporated gentle stream nitrogen gas c the residue reconstituted 200 l aliquot mobile phase centrifuged rpm min a 50 l aliquot supernatant injected directly onto reversed phase c8 hplc column the mobile phase acetonitrile m kh2po4 triethylamine v v ph adjusted phosphoric acid run flow rate ml min the column eluent monitored using fluorescence detector excitation wavelength nm emission wavelength nm detection limit verapamil norverapamil plasma ng ml the coefficient variation pharmacokinetic analysis the total area plasma concentration time curve time zero last measured time plasma auc0 t calculated using trapezoidal rule method the peak plasma concentration cmax time reach cmax tmax directly read experimental data the extent relative oral bioavailability rb verapamil estimated dividing auc0 24 h verapamil atorvastatin auc0 24 h verapamil without atorvastatin the metabolite parent drug ratio mr estimated dividing auc0 24 h norverapamil auc0 24 h verapamil statistical analysis a p value deemed statistically significant using test sigmastat version two means paired data if data normally distributed alternative nonparametric signed rank test performed compare means two groups all results expressed means standard deviations sds l g n l p r e v f n r n e c n c l p b l g n l p r e v r n f n r n e c n c l p time h time h fig mean arterial plasma concentration time profiles verapamil b oral administration verapamil norverapamil mg healthy subjects n 12 presence absence oral atorvastatin mg bars represent standard deviation	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
36	Drug-drug interaction study to assess the effects of multiple-dose pitavastatin on steady-state warfarin in healthy adult volunteers.	Warfarin, an antagonist of vitamin K, which inhibits clotting factor synthesis, is prescribed for thrombosis prophylaxis and treatment and is known to have a narrow therapeutic range. Pitavastatin is a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. In this study, the influence of multiple-dose pitavastatin (4 mg once daily) on steady-state warfarin pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles was investigated in 24 healthy male participants whose international normalized ratio (INR) was maintained by individualized doses of warfarin. The ratio of the least squares mean of prothrombin time and INR was 0.989 (90% confidence interval [CI], 0.955-1.023) and 0.993 (0.956-1.209), respectively (test: warfarin + pitavastatin; reference: warfarin only). The geometric mean ratios of C(max) and AUC were 1.034 (90% CI, 0.994-1.075) and 1.066 (1.035-1.099), respectively, for R-warfarin and 1.033 (0.995-1.073) and 1.058 (1.026-1.092), respectively, for S-warfarin. Warfarin pharmacodynamic profiles and pharmacokinetic profiles did not differ between the warfarin monotherapy and the coadministration of pitavastatin and warfarin. No drug-drug interaction between pitavastatin and warfarin was demonstrated.	materials and methodsstudy designan open-label, add-on study was conducted to determinethe effect of multiple doses of pitavastatin on thesteady-state pd and pk profiles of warfarin. to participatein the study, participants had to be male, aged18 to 45 years, and nonsmokers or had quit at least 6months prior to dosing, without clinically significantdiseases or abnormalities on the basis of medical history,physical examination, and vital sign measurements.concomitant medication, including herbal ornutritional supplements within 14 days before andthroughout the study, was prohibited. in addition, theconsumption of alcohol, grapefruit, caffeine, orquinine-containing foods or beverages within 72 hoursbefore study entry and during the study period wasnot permitted. the study protocol and the informedconsent form were submitted for review, and approvalwas obtained in writing from the institutional reviewboard (integreview, inc, austin, texas). writteninformed consent was obtained from all participantsprior to their participation in the study.the multiple-dose design of pitavastatin understeady state of warfarin administration was selectedto determine pd interaction at the maximum anticoagulanteffect of warfarin. an anticoagulant effectgenerally occurs within 24 hours after warfarinadministration. however, peak anticoagulant effect isnot observed for 72 to 96 hours.1 pitavastatin reachessteady state after 4 days (in-house data). consideringthe time to reach the maximum anticoagulant effect ofwarfarin, the coadministration period was set to 8days. since this study was conducted with healthyvolunteers, the targeted international normalizedratio (inr) was 1.2 to 2.2, and warfarin dose was individualizedaccording to the participantÃs inr. warfarindaily dose was individually titrated based on prothrombintime (pt)/inr measured at predose duringdays 4 to 9. the minimum increment of warfarin dosewas 0.5 mg.participants were admitted to the clinical unit onday _1 and remained in the unit until discharge onday 23, as presented in figure 1. participants receiveda diet containing a relatively consistent daily amountof vitamin k while in the clinical research facility.during the monotherapy period of warfarin (days1-13), participants received warfarin 5 mg daily ondays 1 through 3, and each participantÃs daily warfarindose was individually titrated to achieve the targetedinr within the range of 1.2 to 2.2 on days 4through 9. once the maintenance dose was determined,it was administered on days 10 to 21, andpitavastatin 4 mg was added from days 14 to 22. if aparticipant was not able to tolerate the maintenancedose or the participantÃs inr was outside the range of1.2 to 2.2 for 2 consecutive days before dosing ondays 10, 11, 12, or 13, the participant was withdrawnfrom the study. no withdrawal criteria of inr wereset for the concomitant medication period, but ptand inr were closely monitored daily for safety.warfarin tablet monotherapy or warfarin tabletswith a pitavastatin 4-mg tablet were administered atthe same time in the morning each study day after anovernight fast (approximately 10 hours) with 240 mlof room temperature tap water, followed by a 2-hourfast after dosing except for days 13 and 21, whenparticipants fasted for 4 hours after dosing.participants remained standing or sitting in anupright position for 4 hours after dosing except asrequired by any study-related procedure.participants received a vitamin k injection (1 mgsubcutaneously) after the collection of pd andpk samples on day 22 to permit a rapid reversal ofanticoagulation.1 2 3 4 10 14 21 22pitavastatin 4 mg once dailyfollow-upvisitmaintenance dose of warfarinstudy daywarfarin 5 mgonce dailywarfarintitration9figure 1. study schedule.inagaki et al1304 Â¥ j clin pharmacol 2011;51:1302-1309investigational drugsthe study drug, pitavastatin 4-mg tablet, was manufacturedwith good manufacturing practice byskyepharma (lyon, france). warfarin 1-mg and 2.5-mg tablets were obtained from commercial sources(coumadin;

waters, milford,massachusetts) to determine the concentrations. rands-p-chloro warfarin (sigma-aldrich, st louis,missouri) were used as internal standards for thedetermination of r-warfarin and s-warfarin, respectively.the calibration range was 25 to 1750 ng/ml forboth isomers using 0.5 ml of plasma. interday precisionfor r-warfarin and s-warfarin was less than9.4%, and interday accuracy was within Â±5.1%.pharmacokinetic profilespk parameters were calculated for r- and s-warfarinon day 13 (warfarin alone) and day 21 (warfarin withconcomitant administration of pitavastatin) byapplying a noncompartmental pk approach usingwinnonlin 4.1 (pharsight, mountain view, california).plasma samples for warfarin determinations wereobtained before dosing on days 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19,and 20 and before dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6,8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours after the daily warfarindose on days 13 and 21. sampling at 48 hours wasdone on day 21 to confirm elimination of warfarinfor safety. the actual warfarin doses for r- ands-warfarin were defined as a half-maintenance dosefor individual participants and used for the pkanalysis. actual blood sampling times were used inall pk calculations. maximum observed plasma concentrations(cmax) were estimated from actual plasmaconcentration-time data. the area under the plasmaconcentration-time curve over 1 dosing interval atsteady state (auc0-_) was calculated using lineartrapezoidal summation, where _ was the dose interval(24 hours). samples that were below the limit ofquantitation were treated as zero in the calculationof pk parameters.statistical analysisanalysis of variance (anova) of pd on day 14 (warfarinalone, reference) and day 22 (warfarin withpitavastatin, test) and for pk of both r- and s-warfarinon day 13 (warfarin alone, reference) and day 21(warfarin with pitavastatin, test) was performedusing sas release 8.2 (sas institute, cary, northcarolina). the anova models included treatmentgroup (warfarin alone and warfarin with pitavastatin)as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect.ninety percent confidence intervals (cis) were usedto determine the presence or absence of a drug-druginteraction. if 90% cis of the geometric mean ratio ofthe observed cmax and auc0-_ with and withoutpitavastatin ((warfarin + pitavastatin)/warfarin monotherapy))were within 0.80 to 1.25, the absence of adrug-drug interaction was concluded. this criterionis commonly used for no effect in drug-drug interactionstudies for pk9,10 and has been applied for theanalysis of pd in trials of the same-class drugs.

37	Drug-food interaction potential of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antimicrobial.	To evaluate the effect of food on bioavailability, clarithromycin and 14-hydroxyclarithromycin (active metabolite) pharmacokinetics were assessed in 26 healthy adult volunteers after ingestion of a single oral 500-mg dose of clarithromycin in a fasting state (2 hours before breakfast after an overnight fast) and a nonfasting state (0.5 hours after the start of breakfast). Clarithromycin and 14-hydroxy metabolite plasma concentrations were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatographic technique. Food intake immediately before dosing increased the extent of absorption from the 500-mg tablet formulation by approximately 25%. The mean increase in metabolite area under the plasma concentration-time curve was approximately 9%. These results suggest that clarithromycin can be taken without regard to timing in relation to meals.	methods this ized kinetics 946 ar ten tional tained each one state men state hour signment study two regimen single dose crossover abbott 500 mg clarithromycin laboratories informed review subject 500 mg subject consent board received tablet approved abbott two study regimens minutes b one hours overnight 500 mg administered start tablet breakfast fast the randomized administered sequences study open label tablets park laboratories abbott randomabsorption lot 35il writinstituwas participation ob regimen nonfasting a breakfast regiin fasting twenty seven height age healthy study male mean weight adult kg parameters judged respectively respectively kg good health based cm enrolled sd demographic teer cm minimum regimen 10as volunteers deviation standard ranges years volunreview years each tory medical profile history physical electrocardiogram drug food interaction of clarithromycin examination labora formulations water day starting one half administered approximately orally am overnight hour fast breakfast drug administra non fasting time hours figure mean plasma 14 hydroxyclarithromycin concentrations oral administration mg clarithromycin lower limit detection i ml plasma comthe v the pounds standard mg l deviations standard pharmacokinetic concentration mg l using within day curve less parameters between day range noncompartmental areas time curve time cmax cmax observation standard infinity techniques time compartmental lag kj k1 half life using t112 data one compartment time apparent terminal t109 program apparent metabolite 7 bo calculated compartmental us auc0 whereas tmax plasma hours peak concentra auc024 calculated concentradetermined plasma techniques concentration time used absorption formation disposition fits rate constant biexponential model fits open nonlin rate rate calconcon k01 equaper statistical weighted factor appropriate lexington ky data 1 concentration selection model based although visual akaike inspection taken also criterion 12 versus observed bioavailability reference test auc0 analysis least also variance significant statistical analyzed procedure calculated percent statistical data least obtained difference analyses using inof means determined squares glm propairwise compari procedure relative two confidence significance bioavailone sided intervals ing techniques tion time using tion profile culate stant stant tion formed consultants formation consideration ratio cmax cedure son also ability tests ci auc fitted utilized study ml dosing served tion regimen collection blood throughout blood collected trifuged vial plasma regimen a hours drug administration b lunch dinner served given collection samples dosing meal content study ml phase tubes heparinized study obtained plasma frozen transferred 10 176 cor concentrations blood 10 hour 6 hour standardized dosing hours cen samples promptly polyethylene assayed all colder clarithromycin chromatographic determined metabolite liquid plasma internal samples mixed standard erythromycin sodium alkalinized methyl t butyl evaporated ether dryness h2o methanol n proextracted injected back redissolved volume aqueous gamma marlton phase rp 1 tm phosphate nj column buffer volume using procewith a carbonthe orthe onto x mm eluted m electrochemi n promobile work via in set potential effluent bas monitored lafayette inc carbon glassy extracted in solution 14 hydroxylated high performance brief dure known amount 9 0 methyloxime ate ganic residues panol hexane reverse phase es mixture panol methanol the phase detection cal ing electrode the industries ph non fasting 149 149 149 149 fasting figure administration mean plasma clarithromycin concentrations oral mg clarithromycin anti infective agents chu et al per cary stan e e c e x e e z c cl c o n ri th ce n 0 hi i 228 n cj o9 o2 z v i j_j i i oio e n e j i i z r j j u v e c miocj r o2 o i ii il ol ic l n icsi i0 v r ii i z u l 149 iu il c id 6e ot i l z e e	PK Trial	PK Trial	PK Trial	1	1	1
38	Drug/Drug interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir and rosuvastatin in healthy volunteers.	This open-label, single-arm, pharmacokinetic (PK) study in HIV-seronegative volunteers evaluated the bioequivalence of rosuvastatin and lopinavir/ritonavir when administered alone and in combination. Tolerability and lipid changes were also assessed. Subjects took 20 mg of rosuvastatin alone for 7 days, then lopinavir/ritonavir alone for 10 days, and then the combination for 7 days. Intensive PK sampling was performed on days 7, 17, and 24. Twenty subjects enrolled, and PK data were available for 15 subjects. Geometric mean (+/-SD) rosuvastatin area under the concentration time curve (AUC)[0,tau] and maximum concentration (Cmax) were 47.6 ng.h/mL (+/-15.3) and 4.34 ng/mL (+/-1.8), respectively, when given alone versus 98.8 ng.h/mL (+/-65.5) and 20.2 ng/mL (+/-16.9) when combined with lopinavir/ritonavir (P < 0.0001). The geometric mean ratio was 2.1 (90% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7 to 2.6) for rosuvastatin AUC[0,tau] and 4.7 (90% CI: 3.4 to 6.4) for rosuvastatin Cmax with lopinavir/ritonavir versus rosuvastatin alone (P < 0.0001). There was 1 asymptomatic creatine phosphokinase elevation 17 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and 1 liver function test elevation between 1.1 and 2.5 times the ULN with the combination. Rosuvastatin low-density lipoprotein reduction was attenuated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Rosuvastatin AUC and Cmax were unexpectedly increased 2.1- and 4.7-fold in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir. Rosuvastatin and lopinavir/ritonavir should be used with caution until the safety, efficacy, and appropriate dosing of this combination have been demonstrated in larger populations.	methods subjects healthy hiv-1Ãseronegative men and nonpregnant women between 18 and 60 years of age who weighed $50 kg and were within 30% (6) of their ideal body weight were eligible. subjects had to have hematologic, metabolic, renal, and hepatic function test results all within normal limits and a creatine phosphokinase (cpk) level ,195 u/l. subjects were instructed not to consume alcohol for 48 hours before lipid proÃle testing and on pk sampling days. the following were criteria for exclusion from study participation: allergy/ sensitivity to rosuvastatin (or any other statin) or lopinavir/ ritonavir; active drug or alcohol abuse or dependence; active cardiovascular, renal, hematologic, hepatic, neurologic, gas- trointestinal, psychiatric, endocrine, or immunologic dis- ease(s); any chronic gastrointestinal conditions that might interfere with drug absorption; and the use of investigational, prescription, or over-the-counter medications within 14 days of study entry with the exception of aspirin, acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, multivitamins, mineral supplements, or hormonal contraceptives. postmenopausal women requiring hormone replacement therapy were excluded from participa- tion in this study. women who were pregnant or breast-feeding and women and men of reproductive potential actively engaging in sexual activity or assisted reproductive technology with the intent of pregnancy were also excluded. men and women of reproductive potential were required to use at least 2 contraceptive methods during the course of this study and for 4 weeks after its completion. because of the potential effects of lopinavir/ritonavir on oral contraceptive concentrations, all participants were required to use a barrier method (condoms, diaphragm, female condom, or cervical cap) during the study and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. this study was approved by the colorado multiple institutional review board. all participants provided written informed consent. all study procedures were in accordance with the helsinki declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. q 2007 lippincott williams & wilkins design this was an open-label, single-arm, 3-phase pk study designed to determine the effects of lopinavir/ritonavir on the area under the concentration time curve (auc[0,t]) over the dosing interval and maximum concentration (cmax) of rosuvastatin in hiv-1Ãseronegative subjects. subjects were given 20 mg of rosuvastatin once daily on study days 1 to 7 (phase 1). subjects took the rosuvastatin in the morning. on study days 8 to 17, study participants were instructed to take 2 lopinavir/ritonavir tablets (400 mg/100 mg) orally twice daily (phase 2). on days 18 to 24, the lopinavir/ritonavir was continued and the 20 mg of rosuvastatin taken once daily in the morning was reintroduced (phase 3). participants underwent intensive 24-, 12-, and 24-hour pk visits on study days 7, 17, and 24, respectively. blood samples for pk analysis of rosuvastatin were collected before dosing and at the following times after an observed dose of study drug(s) on days 7 and 24: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours. blood samples for pk analysis of lopinavir/ritonavir were collected before dosing and at the following times after an observed dose of study drugs on days 17 and 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 hours. a single blood sample was also drawn to check for residual rosuvastatin in the bloodstream on study day 17. for all 3 intensive pk study visits, subjects consumed a nonstandar- dized breakfast immediately before taking study medications. adherence was assessed using a standardized questionnaire. the rosuvastatin and lopinavir/ritonavir were given simulta- neously in the morning on the day of the phase 3 intensive pk visit, and the evening dose of lopinavir/ritonavir was given 12 hours after the morning dose. bioanalyses lopinavir/ritonavir in plasma blood for determination of lopinavir and ritonavir was processed by centrifugation with the plasma stored (270Â¡c) within 30 minutes of collection. lopinavir and ritonavir plasma concentrations were determined using a simultaneous validated high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) ultraviolet (uv) method (antiviral pharmacology laboratory, university of colorado, denver, co). brieÃy, after addition of internal standard, a liquid-liquid extraction procedure with t-butylmethylether at basic ph was used to prepare the samples. the chromatographic separation of the compounds and the internal standard was accomplished on a waters ymc hplc 100-mm 3 4.6-mm reversed-phase octyl column with a 3-mm particle size (waters corporation, milford, ma). the mobile phase consisted of 54.7% 20-mm acetate buffer/45.3% acetonitrile, ph 4.9, with an isocratic Ãow rate of 1 ml/min. detection and quantiÃcation of the drugs were at 212 nm. the assay was linear over the range of 20 to 20,000 ng/ml, with a minimum limit of quantiÃcation (loq) of 20 ng/ml using 0.2 ml of human plasma. the standard curves generated had coefÃcients of determination (r2) .0.9988. precision and accuracy were measured in quality controls at 75, 750, and 7500 ng/ml, and all accuracies were within 15% of the nominal concentration with percent relative standard deviation of ,10%. 571 copyright Â© lippincott williams & wilkins. unauthorized

tected from light and cooled to approximately 4Â¡c in an ice bath and then centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection. after centrifugation, 1.5 ml of plasma was transferred to a separate tube and 1.5 ml of 0.1-m acetate buffer, ph 4.0, was added. the samples were thoroughly mixed, and 1.5-ml aliquots of the buffered plasma were then transferred to separate tubes, frozen (270Â¡c), and protected from light. rosuvastatin in plasma was determined by a validated method (covance laboratories, madison, wi). rosuvastatin and the internal standard were extracted from human plasma by a robotic liquid handling system in which plasma proteins were precipitated by the addition of an ethanol solution containing the internal standard. after evaporation under nitrogen, the residue was reconstituted and analyzed by liquid chromatog- raphy tandem mass spectometry (lc/ms/ms). this methodÃs lower loq for rosuvastatin was 0.05 ng/ml using a 0.2-ml aliquot of plasma. the upper loq in undiluted samples was 100 ng/ml. plasma dilutions of 1:10 have been validated to extend the working range for quantitation to 1000 ng/ml. pharmacokinetic analysis rosuvastain, lopinavir, and ritonavir pk analyses were determined by noncompartmental methods (winnonlin, v5.0.1; pharsight corporation, mountain view, ca). cmax, time to cmax (tmax), and concentration at 24 hours after dose (c24) were determined visually. auc[0,t] was determined using the linear-log trapezoidal rule. total apparent oral clearance (cl/f) was determined as dose divided by auc[0,t]. half-lives were calculated as 0.693 divided by lz, where lz is the terminal elimination rate constant. safety and tolerability assessments clinical adverse effects were assessed using a question- naire. subjects were asked to grade the severity of their adverse effect as mild (does not interfere with normal activities), moderate (interferes with normal activities to some extent), or serious (life threatening, requiring hospitalization, or persis- tent or signiÃcant disability/incapacity). laboratory tests were performed at baseline and on all 3 intensive pk study visits. clinical and laboratory adverse events were graded by study investigators using the 1992 division of aids table for grad- ing the severity of adult and pediatric adverse experiences.42 lipid measurements each subjectÃs fasting total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (hdl), and triglycerides were measured at base- line and on study days 7, 17, and 24. ldl was calculated as previously described.43 statistical analysis the primary endpoint for this study was rosuvastatin and lopinavir/ritonavir auc[0,t] and cmax bioequivalence when given alone and in combination. the study was powered based on the expectation that 18 subjects would provide complete data, with 98% and 84% power for rosuvastatin auc[0,t] and cmax, respectively, such that the 90% conÃdence interval for the geometric least square (gls) means ratio would be contained within the interval of 0.7 to 1.43. this interval was used in several previous drug-drug interaction studies with rosuvastatin.44Ã48 the gls means (and 90% conÃdence inter- vals) were determined for rosuvastatin, lopinavir, and ritonavir pk parameters. paired t tests were done to clarify results. paired t tests were used to compare the percent change in lipids from baseline to phase 1 and the percent change from phase 2 to phase 3. no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. sas version 9.1 (sas institute, cary, nc) was used for data analyses.

39	Duloxetine is both an inhibitor and a substrate of cytochrome P4502D6 in healthy volunteers.	Duloxetine, a potent dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine currently undergoing clinical investigation for treatment of depression and stress urinary incontinence, has the potential to act as both a substrate and an inhibitor of cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6). Our objectives were to determine the effect of duloxetine on the pharmacokinetics of desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant metabolized by CYP2D6 (study 1), and the effect of paroxetine, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, on duloxetine pharmacokinetics (study 2). Subjects were healthy men and women between 21 and 63 years old. All subjects were genotypically CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In study 1, 50 mg of desipramine was administered as a single dose alone and in the presence of steady-state duloxetine 60 mg twice daily. In study 2, steady-state pharmacokinetics of duloxetine 40 mg once daily were determined in the presence and absence of steady-state paroxetine 20 mg once daily. Duloxetine increased the maximum plasma concentration of desipramine 1.7-fold and the area under the concentration-time curve 2.9-fold. Paroxetine increased the maximum plasma concentration of duloxetine and the area under the concentration-time curve at steady state 1.6-fold. Reports of adverse events were similar whether duloxetine was administered alone or in combination with desipramine or paroxetine. Duloxetine 60 mg twice daily is a moderately potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, intermediate between paroxetine and sertraline. The potent CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine has a moderate effect on duloxetine concentrations. The results of these 2 studies suggest that caution should be used when CYP2D6 substrates and inhibitors are coadministered with duloxetine.	methods sites. study 1 (identiÃer f1j-lc-hmaz) was car- ried out at the lilly laboratory for clinical research, indiana university hospital and outpatient center, in- dianapolis, ind, and study 2 (identiÃer f1j-fw-sbag) was conducted at the lilly-nus centre for clinical pharmacology pte ltd, singapore. subjects. study 1 subjects were healthy men (n _ 7) and healthy nonpregnant women (n _ 9), aged 21 to 63 years (mean, 42 years). study 2 subjects were healthy men (n _ 12), aged 21 to 27 years (mean, 24 years) (the protocol was open to both men and women). subjects in study 1 were nearly all caucasians (15 of 16). subjects in study 2 were nearly all of chinese or malay descent (11 of 12). mean body weight was similar in the 2 studies; the mean weight in study 1 was 71.4 kg and the mean weight in study 2 was 70.6 kg. health was assessed on the basis of medical history, physical ex- amination, laboratory test results, and electrocardio- gram. subjects taking medications or other substances that might interfere with pharmacokinetic assessment were excluded. subjects were screened for evidence of alcohol or drug abuse by laboratory tests (study 1) or history (study 1 and study 2). in both studies, only volunteers who were ascertained to be cyp2d6 exten- sive metabolizers by genotyping (ppgx, morrisville, nc) were eligible to participate. all subjects provided written informed consent. study design. study 1 was conducted in 2 distinct periods separated by a 7-day washout. in period 1, a single 50-mg dose of desipramine was administered, and blood samples were obtained for the measurement of desipramine plasma concentrations immediately be- fore the dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hours after dosing. in period 2, du- loxetine was administered at an initial dose of 40 mg twice daily. subjects who did not tolerate this dose were allowed to have the dose lowered to 20 mg twice daily for up to 5 doses, after which dosing at 40 mg twice daily was resumed. on the seventh day of dulox- etine dosing (day 14 of the overall protocol), the dose was increased to 60 mg twice daily and was continued at that level for an additional 14 days. on day 21 of the overall protocol (day 8 of duloxetine 60 mg twice daily dosing), a 50-mg dose of desipramine was adminis- tered. blood samples were drawn to determine desipra- mine plasma concentrations as described for period 1, with additional samples at 168 and 192 hours after the desipramine dose. on the day before and the day of the period 2 desipramine dose (protocol days 20 and 21), blood samples for the measurement of duloxetine plasma concentrations were drawn immediately before duloxetine administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after administration. in study 2, there were 2 study periods separated by at least 4 days. in period 1, subjects received 40 mg duloxetine every day for 5 days. blood samples for the measurement of duloxetine plasma concentrations were taken immediately before duloxetine dosing on days 3, 4, and 5 and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after dosing on day 5. in period 2, subjects received 20 mg paroxetine every day for 20 days. beginning on day 12 of this period, subjects again received duloxetine 40 mg every day for 5 days and samples were taken as in period 1, except that addi- tional samples were taken 96 and 120 hours after the Ãnal duloxetine dose. on the Ãnal day of duloxetine dosing in each period, subjects fasted from midnight until 4 hours after dosing. all doses of study drugs were supervised by study site personnel. both studies were conducted in an open-label man- ner. safety was assessed by physical examination and clinical laboratory tests. all unexpected signs, symp- toms, and concomitant medications were recorded. analytic methods. duloxetine plasma concentrations were analyzed by oneida research services inc (whitesboro, ny) with a validated liquid chromatog- 172 skinner et al clinical pharmacology & therapeutics march 2003 spectrometry gas chromatography with raphyÃtandem mass (lc-ms-ms) method. desipramine plasma concentrations were ana- lyzed by ppd development (richmond, va) with a validated nitrogen- phosphorus detection method. in study 2, phenotypic cyp2d6 activity (extensive or poor metabolizer status) was assessed by determining the ratio of dextrometho- rphan to its metabolite dextrorphan in 8-hour urine samples after a 25-mg dose of the parent drug.11,12 urine concentrations of dextromethorphan and dextror- phan were analyzed by ricerca (plainesville, ohio) using a validated lc-ms-ms method. plasma concentration-time data were analyzed by noncompartmental methods with use of winnonlin (professional version, 2.1 or 3.1; pharsight, mountain view, calif). the maximum plasma concentrations (cmax or cmax, ss) and the corresponding sampling time were determined by inspection of the data. by plotting plasma concentration-time data on a semilogarithmic scale, the terminal log-linear phase was visually iden- tiÃed and the slope of the regression line represented the elimination rate constant (_ z). an elimination half- life value (t1Ã2) was calculated as ln(2)/_ z. the linear trapezoidal method was used to calculate the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) up to the last measurable sampling time after single dosing (auc0-t) and within a daily dosing interval at steady state (auc0-24h, ss). the single-dose total auc value (auc0-_) was estimated by the extrapolation of auc0-t to inÃnite time with use of a concentration value pre- dicted at the last measurable sampling time. the appar- ent plasma clearance (cl/f) was calculated as dose divided by auc0-_ or auc0-24h, ss. the apparent vol- umes of distribution (v/f) were estimated as cl/f divided by _ z. at steady state, the minimum plasma concentration (cmin, ss) was determined by inspection, and the average plasma concentration (cav, ss) was calculated as auc0-24h, ss divided by the dosing interval (24 hours). pharmacokinetic parameters, except for the time to reach cmax (tmax), were log transformed and statisti- cally analyzed with the sas procedure mixed (sas institute, cary, nc). either treatments or (in study 1) treatments and gender were used as the Ãxed effect, with subjects as the random effect. the geometric means for both treatments, the ratio of geometric means, the 90% conÃdence interval (ci) of the ratio, and the p value for the hypothesis of no difference between treatments were obtained for the main phar- macokinetic parameters. additionally, variance compo- nents for the intersubject (between) and intrasubject (within) variability were calculated for the main phar- macokinetic variables. these variance components were expressed as coefÃcients of variation. the analy- sis of tmax in study 2 was based on a nonparametric method. median and range for both treatments and the p value from a wilcoxon signed-rank test were calcu- lated. statistical signiÃcance was set at p _ .05.

40	Effect of a single-dose rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin in healthy volunteers.	As an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase that catalyses the first step of cholesterol synthesis, pitavastatin undergoes little hepatic metabolism; however, it is a substrate of uptake and efflux transporters. Since pitavastatin is potentially co-administered with agents that affect transporter activities, the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin was investigated on the effects of a single-dose rifampin in healthy volunteers. Twelve Chinese healthy male volunteers took 4 mg pitavastatin orally with 150 ml water or with a single dose of 600 mg rifampin on separate occasions and the plasma concentrations of pitavastatin were measured over 48 h by HPLC-MS/MS. A single dose of rifampin significantly increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve(AUC)(0-48 h) and Cmax of pitavastatin by 573.5 %(95%CI, 373.3-773.7 %, p < 0.001) and 819.2 %(95 % CI, 515.4-1123.0 %, p < 0.001) respectively, while significantly decreased the t1/2 and CL/F of pitavastatin by 38.8 % (95 % CI, 18.2-59.4 %, p < 0.001) and 81.4 % (95 % CI, 75.0-87.7 %, p < 0.001) respectively. Co-administration of pitavastatin with a single dose of rifampin resulted in a significant increase in plasma levels of pitavastatin in Chinese healthy subjects.	materials methods materials reagents

41	Effect of alosetron on the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine.	Lotronex (alosetron hydrochloride) is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in females whose predominant bowel habit is diarrhea. Alosetron is extensively metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant that is administered as a racemic mixture of equipotent R- and S-enantiomers. Fluoxetine metabolism involves CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 in the formation of its major metabolite, norfluoxetine. This metabolite is also present as two enantiomers, of which only the S-enantiomer exhibits comparable antidepressant activity. This study was conducted to assess the potential for an effect of alosetron on the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine. This was an open-label, two-period, nonrandomized, crossover study in 12 healthy female and male volunteers. The pharmacokinetics for both enantiomers of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine were examined following single oral doses of 20 mg fluoxetine, given alone and in combination with alosetron 1 mg twice daily for 15 days. The results showed small delays in peak concentration but no clinically significant effect of alosetron on the pharmacokinetics of S- and R-fluoxetine or S- and R-norfluoxetine. Coadministration of alosetron and fluoxetine was well tolerated by all subjects.	subjects and methods subjects the study (s3b10935) was conducted at quintiles phase i services in lenexa, kansas, in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and was approved by an in- dependent institutional review board. all subjects pro- vided written informed consent prior to participation in the study. twelve healthy nonsmoking volunteers (8 females and 4 males; 11 white and 1 black), ages 21 to 50 years, completed the study. all subjects were genotyped as Ãextensive metabolizersÃ with regard to cyp2d6 activ- ity. subjects weighed 58 to 99 kg with a body mass index of 23 to 29 kg/m2. females were either of nonchildbearing potential or used acceptable contra- ceptive methods and had a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and prior to dosing. concomitant med- ications, apart from continuous contraceptive or hor- mone replacement therapy, were not allowed from 7 days prior through completion of the study. night through 4 hours after each fluoxetine dose. identical meals were provided for each lunch and each dinner on day 1 of each treatment period. in each pe- riod, serial blood samples (10 ml) for measurement of plasma s- and r-fluoxetine and s- and r-norfluoxetine were collected prior to dosing and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, 192, 240, 288, and 336 hours postdose. blood was heparinized and centrifuged, and plasma was separated for storage at Ã20Â¡c until assayed. s- and r-fluoxetine and s- and r-norfluoxetine plasma concentrations were analyzed in two separate assays by gc/ms using an adaptation of the method de- scribed by eap et al.9 plasma aliquots (0.25 ml) were basified and extracted with n-heptane/ethyl acetate, and the organic extract was evaporated to dryness with nitrogen. following derivatization with (s)-(Ã)-n- (trifluoroacetyl) prolyl chloride, the mixture was dried under a stream of nitrogen. the residue was reconsti- tuted in toluene/iso-amyl alcohol and injected into the gc/ms with negative-ion, chemical ionization detec- tion. intraday accuracy over 3 days ranged within 11% of nominal for s- and r-fluoxetine and 10% of nominal for s- and r-norfluoxetine. intraday precision ranged within 6% of nominal for s- and r-fluoxetine and within 9% of nominal for s- and r-norfluoxetine. ac- curacy was within 7% of nominal. the lower limit of quantitation for all four analytes was 1.00 ng/ml. safety was assessed during the study by recording vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and any reported adverse events. study design pharmacokinetic analysis this was an open-label, single-dose, two-period, nonrandomized crossover study. during the first pe- riod, subjects received a single oral dose of fluoxetine 20 mg (prozacÂ¨, dista, usa). during the second period, subjects received a single oral dose of fluoxetine 20 mg in combination with alosetron 1 mg (lotronexÂ¨, glaxo wellcome inc.). alosetron administration was contin- ued twice daily, before breakfast and dinner, for 14 days (total of 28 doses) to maintain therapeutic concentra- tions through the period during which fluoxetine was being metabolized. starting with the evening dose on day 2, subjects took their alosetron doses on an outpa- tient basis at times other than clinic visits for blood sampling and recorded the time of dosing in a diary, which was reviewed during each clinic visit. each treatment period consisted of 15 days with a washout of 6 weeks between fluoxetine doses. subjects were housed in the study unit for the first 24 hours of each treatment period and fasted from the prior mid- plasma s- and r-fluoxetine and s- and r-norfluoxetine concentration data were used to derive the area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (aucÂ°), the ratios of aucÂ° of s-norfluoxetine to s-fluoxetine and r-norflu- oxetine to r-fluoxetine, peak concentration (cmax) and time (tmax), and elimination half-life (t1/2). these analy- ses were performed by noncompartmental methods us- ing winnonlinÂ¨ professional version 3.0 (pharsight corp, mountain view, ca). half-life was estimated by log-linear least-squares regression. aucÂ° was com- puted by the linear/log-trapezoidal method. statistical analysis aucÂ°, cmax, and t1/2 were loge transformed and analyzed using an analysis of variance (anova) model account- ing for subject and treatment effects. tmax was analyzed using the wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data. 456 j clin pharmacol 2001;41:455-458 effect of alosetron on fluoxetine figure 1. median plasma concentrations (n = 12) of s-fluoxetine (squares) and r-fluoxetine (triangles) following single-dose adminis- tration of 20 mg fluoxetine alone (open symbol) or with coadministration of alosetron 1 mg bid (closed symbol). figure 2. median plasma concentrations (n = 12) of s-norfluoxetine (squares) and r-norfluoxetine (triangles) following single-dose ad- ministration of 20 mg fluoxetine alone (open symbol) or with coadministration of alosetron 1 mg bid (closed symbol). the estimated median difference in tmax was computed using a nonparametric method.10,11	DDI Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	0	2	2
42	Effect of cinacalcet hydrochloride, a new calcimimetic agent, on the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan: in vitro and clinical studies.	Cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet) is a positive allosteric modulator of the calcium-sensing receptor indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients. In vitro study has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 with a K(i) value of 0.087 micromol/L, which is comparable to the well-known potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, quinidine (0.064 micromol/L). A clinical study was conducted to assess the inhibitory effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 substrates in healthy volunteers. Each subject received 50 mg of cinacalcet or a matched placebo orally once daily for 8 days with 30 mg of dextromethorphan coadministered on day 8. The mean AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) of dextromethorphan increased 11- and 7-fold, respectively, in extensive metabolizers when coadministered with cinacalcet versus placebo. Therefore, during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet, it may be necessary to consider making dose adjustments for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index that are mainly metabolized by CYP2D6.	materials and methods in vitro study nadp glucose 6 phosphate g6p glucose6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pdh purchased oriental yeast co ltd tokyo japan dextromethorphan hydrobromide monohydrate

43	Effect of clopidogrel and ticlopidine on cytochrome P450 2B6 activity as measured by bupropion hydroxylation.	Our objective was to study the effect of the antiplatelet agents clopidogrel and ticlopidine on bupropion (INN, amfebutamone) hydroxylation, a probe reaction for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 activity. Twelve healthy male volunteers took a single 150-mg oral dose of bupropion either alone or after pretreatment with 75 mg clopidogrel once daily or 250 mg ticlopidine twice daily for 4 days. On day 4, a single 150-mg oral dose of bupropion was administered. Plasma concentrations of bupropion and its CYP2B6-catalyzed metabolite, hydroxybupropion, were measured for up to 72 hours. The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of hydroxybupropion calculated from time 0 to infinity was reduced by 52% ( P = .001; 95% confidence interval [CI], 39% to 66%) by clopidogrel and by 84% ( P < .0001; 95% CI, 73% to 94%) by ticlopidine. Clopidogrel reduced the AUC ratio of hydroxybupropion over bupropion by 68% ( P = .002; 95% CI, 58% to 77%) and ticlopidine by 90% ( P = .001; 95% CI, 85% to 96%). The AUC of bupropion was increased by 60% ( P = .02; 95% CI, 21% to 98%) and by 85% ( P < .0001; 95% CI, 48% to 85%) with clopidogrel and ticlopidine, respectively. Both clopidogrel and ticlopidine significantly inhibited the CYP2B6-catalyzed bupropion hydroxylation. Patients receiving either clopidogrel or ticlopidine are likely to require dose adjustments when treated with drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2B6.	methods subjects and ethical aspects. twelve healthy, non- smoking male volunteers aged 22 to 27 years (weight range, 67-95 kg; body mass index range, 21-26 kg/m2) participated in this study after having given written informed consent. the subjects were ascertained to be in good health by medical history, a full clinical exam- ination, and standard hematologic and blood chemical laboratory tests before enrollment. none of the subjects was taking continuous medications or natural products. the trial was designed and monitored in accordance with good clinical practice and the declaration of helsinki. the study protocol was approved by the eth- ics committee of the varsinais-suomi healthcare dis- trict, finland, and by the finnish national agency for medicines. study design. this study was an open crossover study with 3 phases. between phases 1 and 2, there was a 1-week-long washout period, and between phases 2 and 3, there was a washout period of 2 weeks. the Ãrst phase was a control period, in which all volunteers received a single oral dose of bupropion (zyban sus- tained release, 150 mg; glaxosmithkline, uxbridge, united kingdom). in the second and third phases the volunteers received a 4-day-long oral antiplatelet agent pretreatment in randomized balanced order with either clopidogrel (plavix, 75 mg once daily; sanoÃ syn- thelabo, guildford, united kingdom) or ticlopidine (ticlid, 250 mg twice daily; sanoÃ synthelabo). on day 4, 1 hour after the last dose of the antiplatelet agent, a single 150-mg dose of bupropion was administered. venous blood samples (10 ml each) for determination of bupropion and hydroxybupropion concentrations were taken just before and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after administration of bupropion. blood samples were collected into tubes containing lithium-heparin anticoagulant and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1600g. plasma was separated from the sam- ples and transferred for storage at _70Â¡c until analyzed. the clinical study was conducted in a single center (department of pharmacology and clinical pharmacol- ogy, university of turku, turku, finland), and the volunteers were under direct medical supervision dur- ing the 3 study days. during phases 2 and 3, the administration of clopidogrel and ticlopidine was done by the volunteers themselves on days 1 to 3 and by the research personnel on day 4. compliance was ensured by tablet counting, and the subjects conÃrmed each intake of the ticlopidine or clopidogrel dose by use of a short message service immediately after taking the dose. bupropion was administered by study personnel. in all phases the volunteers fasted for 8 hours before and 4 hours after administration of bupropion. identical meals were provided on the 3 study days. volunteers were also required to refrain from strenuous physical exercise, alcohol- or caffeine-containing drinks, smok- ing, grapefruit juice, and other medications for 2 days before and after study drug administration. instrumentation and analysis of plasma bupropion and hydroxybupropion concentrations. the plasma samples were thawed, and 150-_l samples were mixed with 450 _l of acetonitrile containing phenacetin (icn biomedicals inc, costa mesa, calif) as internal stan- dard in sirocco 96-well protein precipitation plates (waters corp, milford, mass) according to the manu- facturerÃs instructions. chromatographic separation was carried out with a waters xterra rp8 column (2.1 _ 50 mm, particle size of 3.5 _m) and phenomenex max-rp precolumn (2.0 _ 4 mm) (phenomenex, tor- rance, calif) by use of isocratic elution (20% methanol and 80% ultrapure-grade water containing 0.1% formic acid) with a Ãow rate of 0.4 ml/min. retention times for hydroxybupropion, bupropion, and phenacetin were 1.4, 1.6, and 3.0 minutes, respectively. the hplc eluent Ãow was split post-column with an acurate post-column stream splitter (lc packings, amster- dam, the netherlands) with a ratio of 1:4 to mass spectrometer ion source and to waste, respectively. clinical pharmacology & therapeutics 2005;77(6):553-9 inhibition of bupropion hydroxylation 555 table i. pharmacokinetic parameters of bupropion and hydroxybupropion in 12 healthy subjects after single oral 150-mg dose of bupropion without pretreatment (control) and after 4 daysÃ pretreatment with either 75 mg clopidogrel once daily or 250 mg ticlopidine twice daily % difference for clopidogrel (p value, versus parameter control clopidogrel control) ticlopidine bupropion auc (_g Ã¡ ml_1 Ã¡ h) cmax (ng/ml) tmax (h) t_ (h) cl/f (l Ã¡ h_1 Ã¡ kg_1) 0.36 _ 0.24 51 _ 23 4.0 (2.0 to 5.0) 4.4 _ 1.9 6.8 _ 3.7 0.49 _ 0.23 65 _ 15.5 4.0 (2.0 to 6.0) 3.4 _ 1.1 4.8 _ 2.7 60% (.02) 40% (.01) Ã (.84) _13% (.07) _26% (.006) 0.58 _ 0.28 69 _ 28 3.5 (2.0 to 5.0) 4.2 _ 1.9 3.8 _ 2 % difference for ticlopidine (p value, versus control) 85% (_ .0001) 38% (.01) Ã (.18) 9.9% (.70) _36% (.01) _84% (_ .0001) _78% (_ .0001) Ã (.20) 1.2% (.82) _90% (.001) hydroxybupropion auc (_g Ã¡ ml_1 Ã¡ h) cmax (ng/ml) tmax (h) t_ (h) 12 _ 6.9 362 _ 183 7 (4.0 to 12) 22 _ 8.9 41 _ 29 4.7 _ 0.23 158 _ 73 _52% (.001) _50% (_ .0001) 5.5 (3.0 to 12) 21 _ 8.3 12 _ 7.4 Ã (.44) _4.2% (.38) _68% (.002) 1.3 _ 0.8 55 _ 38 8 (4.0 to 12) 22 _ 12.1 3 _ 2.75 hydroxybupropion/bupropion auc ratio results are given as mean _ sd, except for tmax, which is given as median and range. the percentage difference was calculated within subjects, and the p values are given for the absolute changes. auc, area under plasma concentrationÃtime curve;

95% ci, 39% to 66%) and ticlopidine by 84% (p _ .0001; 95% ci, 73% to 94%) compared with the control phase (table i). the reduction in hydroxybu- propion auc was seen in all 12 subjects with both of the treatments (fig 2, b). the cmax of hydroxybupro- pion decreased by 50% (p _ .0001; 95% ci, 36% to 65%) with clopidogrel treatment and 78% (p _ .0001; 95% ci, 65% to 91%) with ticlopidine treatment. there were no signiÃcant differences in the tmax or t_ of hydroxybupropion observed after either of the anti- platelet drugs compared with control (table i). auc ratio. the auc ratio of hydroxybupropion over bupropion was affected considerably by both an- tiplatelet agents studied. clopidogrel reduced the auc ratio by 68% (p _ .002; 95% ci, 58% to 77%) and ticlopidine reduced the auc ratio by as much as 90% (p _ .001; 95% ci, 85% to 96%) compared with the control phase. these reductions were evident in all subjects. discussion in this study we found that the use of both clopi- dogrel and especially ticlopidine signiÃcantly inhibited cyp2b6 activity as measured by bupropion hydroxy- lation. this was observed as mean decreases of 68% and 90% in the auc ratio of hydroxybupropion over bupropion by clopidogrel and ticlopidine, respectively. it is important that this effect was evident in all of the volunteers participating in the study, although the in- terindividual variation was notable. we used a pretreat- ment period of only 4 days to minimize healthy volun- teer exposure to the antiplatelet drugs. it is possible that the inhibitory effect on cyp2b6 is even stronger with long-term clinical use of clopidogrel and ticlopidine. with clopidogrel, a decline of approximately 50% in both the auc and cmax of hydroxybupropion was observed. with ticlopidine, the formation of hydroxy- bupropion was almost completely blocked, as indicated by the 84% reduction in the auc of hydroxybupro- pion. however, only a moderate increase in the auc fig 1. mean plasma concentrations (sem indicated by error bars) of bupropion (a) and hydroxybupropion (oh- bupropion) (b) after single 150-mg dose of bupropion in 12 healthy male subjects in control phase (squares and solid lines) and after pretreatment with 75 mg clopidogrel once daily (triangles and dashed lines) or with 250 mg ticlopidine twice daily (circles and dotted lines) for 4 days. age differences between the treatments were calculated within subjects, and 95% conÃdence intervals (cis) are given.

44	Effect of clopidogrel on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin.	This study assessed the effects of clopidogrel, a CYP 2C9 inhibitor, on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. The effects of combined clopidogrel-fluvastatin treatment on platelet function were also determined. Subjects received 80 mg fluvastatin (extended-release formulation) alone on days 1 through 9, 80 mg fluvastatin and 300 mg clopidogrel (loading dose) on day 10, and 80 mg fluvastatin and 75 mg clopidogrel (maintenance dose) on days 11 through 19. Compared to treatment with fluvastatin alone, fluvastatin AUC was similar and C(max) increased marginally (15.7%) with concomitant treatment with clopidogrel. Platelet aggregation was inhibited by clopidogrel by 33% two hours after the loading dose and by 47% at steady state, similar to that reported for clopidogrel alone treatment. The authors conclude that coadministration of fluvastatin and clopidogrel has no clinically relevant effect on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics or on platelet inhibition by clopidogrel.	methods study design this study employed an open-label, multiple-dose, sequential design. after screening, 30 healthy male vol- unteers were enrolled to ensure that at least 24 subjects would complete the study. all subjects provided writ- ten informed consent prior to participating in the study and were not to have any surgical or medical condition that might significantly alter the absorption, distribu- tion, metabolism, or excretion of any drug. the assess- ment of background and demographic data included medical history, current medical conditions, date of birth, sex, race, height, elbow breadth, and frame size. subjects were screened for drugs of abuse (alcohol, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates), hepatitis b and c, hiv, and cotinine. safety assessments included moni- toring and recording all observed and reported adverse events, blood chemistry, hematologic profile, urine analysis, electrocardiogram (ecg) recordings, measure- ments of vital signs, and physical examinations. subjects between the ages of 19 and 45 years, in good health as determined by medical history, 614 Â¥ j clin pharmacol 2007;47:613-619 physical examination, ecg, and laboratory tests, were included in the study. the subjects were admitted to the study center for baseline evaluation at least 12 hours prior to initial dosing of fluvastatin. subjects were discharged from the study center on day 1 and returned on the evening of day 4. subjects were con- fined to the study center for the remainder of the study (days 4-19). on study days 1 through 19, subjects received 80 mg fluvastatin extended-release formulation (lescol xl) daily by mouth. on day 10, a loading dose of 300 mg clopidogrel was coadministered with fluvas- tatin. fluvastatin and 75 mg clopidogrel were coad- ministered daily on study days 11 through 19. study medication was administered by the study center personnel with 240 ml of water between 0730 and 0900, after at least a 10-hour fast. all subjects were dosed within a maximum of a 1-hour interval. subjects were instructed not to chew the medication but to swallow it whole. the investigator checked each subjectÃs mouth to ensure that the medication was swallowed. unless performing a study assess- ment, subjects rested in the upright position for the next 4 hours. the study protocol was approved by mds pharma services institutional review board (lincoln, neb, usa). following the approval, the study was con- ducted at sfbc international, (miami, fla, usa) in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and the us code of federal regulations. pharmacokinetic sample collection for the determination of serum concentrations of fluvastatin, 3-ml predose blood samples were col- lected into serum separator tubes on days 7, 8, 17, and 18. serial blood samples were collected on days 9 and 19 at 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours postdose. all samples were collected by either direct venipuncture or by an indwelling cannula inserted in a forearm vein. the samples were protected from direct sunlight and ultraviolet (uv) irradiation. the samples were cen- trifuged at 800 g for 15 minutes between 3Â¡c and 5Â¡c. the serum was separated, and samples were frozen at Ã20Â¡c for determination of fluvastatin con- centration. at the time of conducting this study, no sensitive bioanalytical method was available to mea- sure plasma clopidogrel concentrations at a steady- state therapeutic dose (75 mg). therefore, to assess the fluvastatin effect on clopidogrel, adp-induced platelet aggregation and bleeding time were mea- sured (see pharmacodynamic assessments). clopidogrel has no effect on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics fluvastatin analysis serum concentrations of fluvastatin were measured using high-performance liquid hromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (lc/ms/ms). a liquid chromatographic/tandem mass-spectrometric method is described for the determination of fluvastatin in human serum. of the internal standard (450 ng/ ml of is_xuo320 in 2.25% methanol), 50 Âµl was added to 100-Âµl serum samples, which were thor- oughly mixed and extracted using liquid partition- ing with acetonitrile and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. the separation of analytes was achieved on a waters xterra rp18 column (3.0 _ 50 mm, 3.5 Âµm) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% acetic acid/methanol (35:65, v/v) at an iso- cratic flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. the sample injector was then washed 3 times with mobile phase and 3 times with acetonitrile after each sample injection. detection of analytes was accomplished using turbo ion spray (tis) negative ionization (api4000) with the collision energy set at Ã20 v (ion spray voltage of Ã4500 v) while keeping the ceramic heater tempera- ture at 700Â¡c. the parent compound has a selected m/z ratio of 410.2 for the precursor and 348.2 for the product. the internal standard has a selected m/z ratio of 424.2 for the precursor and 362.0 for the product. appropriate calibration standards and quality control samples were used in the analytical proce- dure. the analytical data were captured using wat- son lims (version 6.2.0.02) software. the limit of quantitation was 2.0 ng/ml. the assay was validated within a concentration range of 2 to 2000 ng/ml. the accuracy and precision (percentage coefficient of variation [%cv]) for calibration, intraday, and interday samples ranged from 96.0% to 112.0% and 1.1% to 17.2%, respectively. the stability of fluvas- tatin was ensured for at least 4.5 months at Ã20Â¡c, for at least 3 freeze-thaw cycles, and for at least 24 hours at room temperature in human serum. pharmacodynamic assessments the pharmacodynamic effect of clopidogrel in com- bination with fluvastatin was assessed by measur- ing inhibition of adp-induced platelet aggregation and prolongation of template bleeding time. blood samples (5 ml/sample) were collected into tubes containing sodium citrate at 2 hours postdosing on day 9 (prior to initiation of clopidogrel administra- tion); on days 10, 12, 14, 16, and 19 (fluvastatin and clopidogrel); and on day 24 (end of study). the blood samples were centrifuged at 100 g for 15 min- utes to obtain platelet-rich plasma (prp). the platelet count in prp was adjusted to 250 000/ml. the remaining sample was further centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes to obtain platelet-poor plasma (ppp), which was used as subject blank. platelet aggregation was induced by 5 Âµm adp, and optical density was measured using a chrono-log optical aggregometer (model 490-4dr with internal aggro/ link interface and windows software version 5.1 or higher). the bleeding time was measured using the ivy method.14 pharmacokinetic assessments pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using serum fluvastatin concentrations by noncompartmen- tal methods (winnonlin pro version 4.1, pharsight corporation, mountain view, calif, usa). the phar- (maximum macokinetic parameters included cmax concentration observed postdose), ctrough (observed predose concentration), tmax (time to cmax), and auc_ (area under the concentration-time curve [auc] from 0 to the time of the dosing interval). statistical analysis all subjects who completed the study with evalu- able pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mea- surements were included in the data analysis. pharmacokinetics fluvastatin pharmacokinetic parameters cmax and auc_ obtained on day 19 (fluvastatin + clopidogrel) and day 9 (fluvastatin alone) were analyzed. statistical analyses were performed on log-transformed para- meter values, using sas version 8.2. each parameter was analyzed using a linear mixed-effect model, and log-mean differences of treatment fluvastatin + clopi- dogrel minus fluvastatin and corresponding 90% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated. these were back-transformed and reported in the original scale. pharmacodynamics percentage of adp-induced platelet aggregation and bleeding time during treatment with fluvastatin + clopidogrel (days 10 through 19) and end of study (day 24) were compared with fluvastatin alone (day 9) using a linear mixed-effect model. for bleeding time, the log-transformed data were used. all pharmacoki- netic and pharmacodynamic parameters during com- bined treatment with fluvastatin and clopidogrel were compared with fluvastatin alone (day 9). drug interactions 615 ayalasomayajula et al table i effects of clopidogrel on steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of fluvastatin cmax, ng/ml auc_, ngÃ¡h/ml ctrough,

45	Effect of CYP3A5*3 genotype on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam in healthy subjects.	Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the CYP3A5 genotype on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam in healthy volunteers. Nineteen healthy male volunteers were divided into 3 groups on the basis of the genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5. The groups comprised subjects with CYP3A5*1/*1 (n=5), CYP3A5*1/*3 (n=7), or CYP3A5*3/*3 (n=7). After a single oral 1-mg dose of alprazolam, plasma concentrations of alprazolam were measured up to 72 hours, together with assessment of psychomotor function by use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, according to CYP3A5 genotype. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve for alprazolam was significantly greater in subjects with CYP3A5*3/*3 (830.5+/-160.4 ng . h/mL [mean+/-SD]) than in those with CYP3A5*1/*1 (599.9+/-141.0 ng . h/mL) (P=.030). The oral clearance of alprazolam was also significantly different between the CYP3A5*1/*1 group (3.5+/-0.8 L/h) and CYP3A5*3/*3 group (2.5+/-0.5 L/h) (P=.036). Although a trend was noted for the area under the Digit Symbol Substitution Test score change-time curve (area under the effect curve) to be greater in subjects with CYP3A5*3/*3 (177.2+/-84.6) than in those with CYP3A5*1/*1 (107.5+/-44), the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=.148). The CYP3A5*3 genotype affects the disposition of alprazolam and thus influences the plasma levels of alprazolam.	methods subjects study design the study protocol approved institutional review board

46	Effect of cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole on risperidone pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.	Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic agent used for the treatment of schizophrenia. It is mainly metabolized by human cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 and partly by CYP3A4 to 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Ketoconazole is used as a CYP3A4 inhibitor probe for studying drug-drug interactions. We aim to investigate the effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone in healthy male volunteers. An open-label, randomized, two-phase crossover design with a 2-week washout period was performed in 10 healthy male volunteers. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 2mg of risperidone alone or in combination with 200mg of ketoconazole, once daily for 3days. Serial blood samples were collected at specific periods after ingestion of risperidone for a period of 96h. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were determined using a validated HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method. After pretreatment with ketoconazole, the clearance of risperidone decreased significantly by 34Ã¡81Â±5Ã¡10% and the T(1/2) of risperidone increased significantly by 28Ã¡03Â±40Ã¡60%. The AUC(0-96) and AUC(0-Â°) of risperidone increased significantly by 66Ã¡61Â± 43Ã¡03% and 66Ã¡54Â±39Ã¡76%, respectively. The Vd/f of risperidone increased significantly by 39Ã¡79Â±53Ã¡59%. However, the C(max) and T(max) of risperidone were not significantly changed, indicating that ketoconazole had minimal effect on the absorption of risperidone. The C(max) , T(max) and T(1/2) of 9-hydroxyrisperidone did not decrease significantly. However, the Cl/f of 9-hydroxyrisperidone increased significantly by 135Ã¡07Â± 124Ã¡68%, and the Vd/f of 9-hydroxyrisperidone decreased significantly by 29Ã¡47Â±54Ã¡64%. These changes led to a corresponding significant decrease in the AUC(0-96) and AUC(0-Â°) of 9-hydroxyrisperidone by 47Ã¡76Â±22Ã¡39% and 48Ã¡49Â± 20Ã¡03%, respectively. Ketoconazole significantly inhibited the metabolism of risperidone through the inhibition of hepatic CYP3A4. our results suggest that besides CYP2D6, CYP3A4 contributes significantly to the metabolism of risperidone. The pharmacokinetics of risperidone was affected by the concomitant administration of ketoconazole. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is used concomitantly with risperidone, it is necessary for the clinicians to monitor their patients for signs of adverse drug reactions.	methods subjects aged male healthy volunteers ten years years body weight kg kg height cm cm enrolled study all subjects healthy based medical history physical examination haematological biochemical pro les subjects known contraindications hypersensitivity either drug excluded well known history alcoholism drug abuse drinking alcoholic beverages coffee tea allowed least month prior entire period study each volunteer given detailed explanation concerning protocol signed informed consent participation study this protocol approved ethics committee faculty science prince songkla university thailand registration no study protocol an open label randomized two phase crossover design 2 week washout period performed study in phase subject group ingested single dose mg risperidone group subject ingested dose risperidone oral pretreatment mg ketoconazole daily days blood samples collected speci c periods i e predose min h ingestion risperidone the plasma separated stored 70 c analysis in phase 2 week washout period volunteers received medication according crossover method plasma samples collected manner phase analysis plasma risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone an analytical method based liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms modi ed reported remmeries et al used determine plasma risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone simultaneously brie y ll internal standard solution ng ml carbamazepine methanol added ml plasma sample then ll w v sodium hydroxide added mixed diethyl ether ml immediately added alkalinized plasma sample tube shaken reciprocally min the mixture centrifuged g min 0 c the ether layer transferred another test tube allowed evaporate room temperature fume cupboard the residue reconstituted ll mobile phase aliquot ll injected onto hplc ms ms system agilent technologies series santa clara ca usa using autosampler the system data processing controlled chemstation software agilent the separation performed using c18 column alltima hp c18 mm lm alltech associates inc deer eld illinois 30 c a guard pak precolumn module alltima hp c18 mm lm used a mixture acetonitrile mm ammonium acetate buffer ph v v used mobile phase ow rate ml min the mobile phase ltered 0 22 lm membrane lter degassed ultrasonication use the electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer operated positive ionization mode the following mass spectrometer conditions used drying gas ow rate l min nebulizer pressure psi drying gas temperature 325 c capillary energy set volts detection ions performed multiple reaction monitoring mode monitoring transition m z precursor ion m z product ion risperidone m z precursor ion m z product ion 9 hydroxyrisperidone m z precursor ion m z product ion carbamazepine the method validation procedures carried accordance us fda guideline 13 pharmacokinetic calculations cmax tmax were determined directly visual inspection the pharmacokinetic parameters auc0 96 auc0 t cl f calculated using winnonlin version pharsight corporation mountain view ca usa non compart ke mental analysis the estimated least square regression slope terminal logarithm ln linear portion plasma concentration time curve used calculating terminal t1 2 ke auc0 96 calculated using linear trapezoidal rule auc0 sum auc0 96 extrapolated auc last quanti able concentration c96 in nity auc96 calculated equation c96 ke elimination rate constant statistical analysis all results expressed mean standard deviation differences risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone pharmacokinetic parameters control treatment phases tested one way anova p value taken minimum level signi cance	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
47	Effect of erythromycin on metabolism of quetiapine in Chinese suffering from schizophrenia.	To study the effect of erythromycin on metabolism of quetiapine in Chinese suffering from schizophrenia. Nineteen patients received multiple doses of quetiapine (200 mg, twice daily) with or without co-administered erythromycin (500 mg, three times daily). Blood samples were collected at specified time intervals for determination of plasma concentrations of quetiapine and some of its metabolites.

Erythromycin has a noticeable effect on the metabolism of quetiapine. When quetiapine is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors such as erythromycin, the dosing regimen should be modified according to quetiapine TDM.	materials and methods drugs and reagents k.-y. li clinical pharmaceutical research institute, hunan provincial tumor hospital of china, changsha, china x. li Â¾ z.-n. cheng Â¾ b.-k. zhang Â¾ w.-x. peng Â¾ h.-d. li (&) clinical pharmaceutical research institute, xangya second hospital, central south university, changsha, 410011, china e-mail: lkunyan@tom.com tel.: +86-731-5524222 fax: +86-731-4436720 quetiapine tablets (batch no.: lot am 188; 25 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg per tablet) and qtp-sf (pur- ity=74%), qtp-h (purity=77%) and qtp-nd (pur- ity=55%) standards were donated by astrazeneca pharmaceuticals (london, uk). quetiapine standard (purity>99.6%) was kindly provided by hunan dong- ting pharmaceutical co. ltd (changde, china). carba- mazepine (i.s., purity>99.9%) was provided by national institute for the control of pharmaceutical and biological products (beijing, china). erythromycin 792 enteric-coated tablets (batch no.: 20011111, 125 mg per tablet) were obtained from zhongxiangkang-sheng pharmaceutic co. ltd (yueyang, china). other ar- grade and high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc)-grade reagents were obtained from chemical reagent factory of hunan (changsha, china). apparatus a waters 2690 hplc equipment system and the oasis hlb extraction cartridge (1 cc/10 mg) (waters cor- poration, milford, ma, usa), and a micromass zq mass spectrometer (wythenshawe, manchester, uk) were used. subjects only the patients who were Ãrst-episode, had not ob- tained signiÃcant therapeutic e_ects or could not tolerate the side e_ects using clozapine, risperidone or any other antipsychotic drugs were enrolled in the study. in the study, 21 chinese in-patients were involved; 2 subjects discontinued the study due to side e_ects of erythromycin on the digestive tract. of the subjects who completed the study, 19 (10 females, 9 males; age 18Ã45 years, weight 41Ã60 kg) were diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizo- phreniform disorder [10]). according to medical history, physical examination and routine laboratory tests, none of the patients had hepatic, renal, cardiac, hematological or other diseases. all pa- tients had taken no drugs during the 2 weeks before the trial, but were permitted to take inosine and propranolol during the trial. they refrained from cigarettes and alcohol. written informed consent was obtained from each patientÃs parent or legal guardian. in the written (criteria of ccmd-iii fig. 1 mean semilogarithmic plasma concentrationÃtime proÃles of quetiapine and its metabolites after oral administration of quetiapine alone and co-administered with erythromycin, n=19 informed consent, the purpose, contents, amount of time required and risks of the study, as well as the beneÃts, conÃdentiality and compensation for the patients from the study were detailed. the patients were completely free to participate in or withdraw from the study. quetiapine and erythromycin during the study were free. patients could enroll in the study, Ãnish the study or abandon the study; they all received some money as compensation. the ethics committee of xiangya second hospital of central south university approved the protocol. experimental protocol during the Ãrst period (days 1Ã8), multiple and rising doses of quetiapine were given to the subjects twice daily (b.i.d). the dosage started at 25 mg b.i.d, reached 200 mg b.i.d by day 4 and remained at 200 mg b.i.d on days 5Ã7. only a morning dose of quetiapine (200 mg) was given on days 8. during the second period (days 9Ã12), Ãxed doses of quetiapine (200 mg, b.i.d) and erythromycin daily) were co-administered to the subjects. a Ãnal combination dose of quetiapine (200 mg) and erythromycin (500 mg) was given in the morning of days 12. after the morning doses on days 8 and days 12, blood samples (2 ml) were collected before and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h. plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at	DDI Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	0	2	2
48	Effect of fluconazole on plasma fluvastatin and pravastatin concentrations.	To study the effects of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin and pravastatin, two inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Two separate randomised, double-blind, two-phase, crossover studies with identical study design were carried out. In each study, 12 healthy volunteers were given a 4-day pretreatment with oral fluconazole (400 mg on day 1 and 200 mg on days 2-4) or placebo, according to a randomisation schedule. On day 4, a single oral dose of 40 mg fluvastatin (study I) or 40 mg pravastatin (study II) was administered orally. Plasma concentrations of fluvastatin, pravastatin and fluconazole were measured over 24 h. In study 1, fluconazole increased the mean area under the plasma fluvastatin concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) by 84% (P < 0.01), the mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of fluvastatin by 80% (P < 0.01) and its mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by 44% (P < 0.05). In study II, fluconazole had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. Fluconazole has a significant interaction with fluvastatin. The mechanism of the increased plasma concentrations and prolonged elimination of fluvastatin is probably inhibition of the CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of fluvastatin by fluconazole. Care should be taken if fluconazole or other potent inhibitors of CYP2C9 are prescribed to patients using fluvastatin. However, pravastatin is not susceptible to interactions with fluconazole or other potent CYP2C9 inhibitors.	methods study design twelve healthy volunteers participated study i uvastatin study men

49	Effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of mexiletine in healthy Japanese men.	Fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is known to inhibit several hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes, in particular CYP1A2. Mexiletine is mainly catalyzed by CYP2D6 and partially catalyzed by CYP1A2. Our objective was to study the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between fluvoxamine and mexiletine. A randomized crossover design with two phases was used. A 7-day washout period separated the two treatment conditions. In the one phase, 6 healthy Japanese men received an oral dose of 200 mg of mexiletine alone (study 1); in the other phase, the men received fluvoxamine (50 mg twice a day) for 7 days, and on the eighth day they received oral mexiletine (200 mg) and fluvoxamine concomitantly (study 2). The concentrations of mexiletine were measured with HPLC. The area under the concentration-time curve and serum peak concentration of mexiletine in study 2 were significantly increased compared with those in study 1 (10.4 +/- 4.85 versus 6.70 +/- 3.21 microg x h/mL, P =.006 and 0.623 +/- 0.133 versus 0.536 +/- 0.164 microg/mL, P =.008, respectively). The effect of fluvoxamine on the mexiletine disposition is comparatively large, and when mexiletine and fluvoxamine are coadministered careful monitoring of mexiletine is needed.	methods subjects six healthy male japanese volunteers given informed consent participated study their mean age body weight years range years kg range kg respectively three subjects nonsmokers three smokers cigarettes per day all subjects good health assessed medical history physical examination routine hematology blood chemistry urinary tests cardiac function electrocardiography study design a randomized crossover design two phases used a 7 day washout period separated two treatment conditions each subject received oral dose mexiletine mg am ml water in one phase received mexiletine alone study phase received fluvoxamine mg twice day days eighth day received mexiletine fluvoxamine concomitantly am study each subject fasted overnight least hours administration mexiletine am continued fast additional hours administration the subjects instructed take medications drink anything included caffeine alcoholic beverages week study throughout study blood sampling blood samples assay mexiletine concentrations drawn administration drug hours administration mexiletine approximately ml blood collected sample forearm vein disposable syringe transferred vacuum blood collection tube after blood samples clotted samples centrifuged harvested serum frozen 30 c analysis analysis serum mexiletine concentrations serum concentrations mexiletine determined hplc ultraviolet detection use minor modification method mastropaoro et al 14 methylmexiletine internal standard in brief 15 mexiletine extracted diethyl ether followed evaporation the residue reconstituted mobile phase mixture mol l sodium phosphate acid buffer solution contained triethylamine ph acetonitrile volume an aliquot consisted reversed phase column str ods ii shinwa chemical industries ltd kyoto japan injected hplc system ultraviolet absorbance detector operated nm the retention time mexiletine internal standard method min respectively the minimum measurable concentration ng ml ml serum used interand intraday variations less pharmacokinetic analyses peak concentrations time reach peak concentrations derived directly measured values the linear terminal slopes log concentration mexiletine versus time curves calculated least squared method use data hours administration mexiletine the terminal half life values calculated the area serum concentration time curve calculated trapezoidal rule extrapolation infinity division last measured concentration terminal slope oral clearance cl f f oral bioavailability calculated dose divided area serum concentration time curve statistical analysis data data presented mean values standard deviation statistical analysis performed use paired student test significant difference text indicates p	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
50	Effect of fluvoxamine on the pharmacokinetics of quinidine.	To investigate the possible involvement of cytochromes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 in the in vivo oxidative metabolism of quinidine. This was an open study of six healthy young male volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of a 200-mg single oral dose of quinidine were studied before and during daily treatment with 100 mg fluvoxamine. Biomarkers of other isozyme activities in the form of caffeine, sparteine, mephenytoin, tolbutamide and cortisol metabolism were applied. The results showed a statistically significant median reduction of 2944% in the quinidine total apparent oral clearance, partial clearances by 3-hydroxylation and N-oxidation and residual clearance during fluvoxamine treatment. Renal clearance was unaffected by fluvoxamine. The effect of fluvoxamine on the formation clearances of 3-hydroxyquinidine and quinidine-N-oxide most likely reflects inhibition of cytochrome P4503A4 by fluvoxamine at clinically relevant doses. The results of this study do not rule out a possible involvement of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 in the in vivo oxidative metabolism of quinidine.	materials and methods subjects this was an open study of six young healthy male volunteers, all phenotyped as extensive metabolisers of sparteine (metabolic ra- tio<20) and mephenytoin (s/r ratio<0.5). all volunteers gave written informed consent. the study was approved by the regional ethics committee and the danish national board of health. before inclusion, all volunteers were screened by physical examination, laboratory tests and electrocardiogram. study procedure on study day 1, the volunteers took a single oral dose of 250 mg tolbutamide (cyp2c9) (tolbutamid ÃÃdakÃÃ, nycomed dak, denmark) at 0800 hours. urine was collected for the next 6 h and a 10-ml sample was frozen at )20 (cid:176)c until analysis. blood glucose was measured after 6 h. on study day 2, the volunteers took 100 mg sparteine (cyp2d6) (depasan, giulini pharma, germa- ny), 100 mg mephenytoin (cyp2c19) (mesantoin, sandoz phar- maceuticals, usa) and 200 mg caÂeine (cyp1a2) (koÂein ÃÃdakÃÃ, nycomed dak) orally at 0800 hours. it has been docu- mented, that the simultaneous administration of low-dose bio- marker drugs does not inÃuence the outcome of their respective metabolic indices [19]. urine was collected for 12 h, and three 10- ml samples were frozen at )20 (cid:176)c until analysis. a 10-ml blood sample was drawn after 6 h and the plasma was separated by means of centrifugation (10 min at 7000 g) and frozen at )20 (cid:176)c until analysis. on study day 3, following an overnight fast from 2400 hours, the volunteers took a single oral dose of 200 mg quinidine sulfate (kinidin ÃÃdakÃÃ, nycomed dak), equivalent to 511 lmol quini- dine. blood samples (10 ml) were collected at t (cid:136) 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 24 and 48 h. plasma was separated by centrifugation (10 min at 7000 g) and frozen at )20 (cid:176)c until analysis. the vol- unteers were allowed normal meals after the blood sample at t (cid:136) 1 h was drawn. urine was collected for intervals of 0Ã12 h, 12Ã24 h and 24Ã48 h. a 10-ml sample from each period was frozen at )20 (cid:176)c until analysis. following a washout period of 6Ã8 weeks, the volunteers took 100 mg of Ãuvoxamine (fevarin, solvay du- phar, netherlands) daily at 0800 hours on study days )1, 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. the study procedures on days 1Ã4, above, were repeated. during the study, the volunteers refrained from intake of any other medications, alcohol or grapefruit juice. consumption of coÂee or xanthine-containing foods was not allowed for a period of 48 h before and the 12 h during caÂeine testing. the volunteers were asked speciÃcally about adverse events on a daily basis during medication. following Ãuvoxamine treatment, control laboratory tests were performed. the quinidine and the quinidine and Ãu- voxamine sessions were performed without randomisation of the sequence, justiÃed by only using hard end-points, i.e. drug- and metabolite-concentrations in plasma and urine, in the study. quinidine and metabolites quinidine, 3-hydroxyquinidine and quinidine-n-oxide in plasma and urine were analysed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) methods described previously [20]. tolbutamide and metabolites a method for the quantiÃcation of tolbutamide, 4-hydroxytolbut- amide and the secondary metabolite carboxytolbutamide in urine was developed. brieÃy, 1-ml urine samples were added to 25 ll 0.01 m internal standard, chlorpropamide, 30 ll 2 m hcl and 4 ml of tert-butyl methyl ether. the mixture was shaken for 30 min, and the phases were separated by 10 min of centrifugation at 1100 g. the tubes were placed at )30 (cid:176)c until the aqueous phase was frozen. the organic phase was transferred to conical glass tubes and evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen steam at 40 (cid:176)c. the residue was reconstituted in 1 ml of a mobile phase consisting of a 23:77% (v/v) mixture of methanol and 0.01 m sodium acetate buÂer adjusted to a ph of 3.0 with 60% perchloric acid. a sample of 100 ll was taken from the middle and transferred to hplc vials. chromatography was performed using merck-hitachi in- struments: an as-2000a autosampler with a 100-ll injector loop, a l-5025 column thermostat, a l-6200 intelligent pump and a l-4250 uv-vis detector. the system was controlled through a d-6000 interface module hplc system manager (hsm) and an ibm personal computer. separations were achieved using a spherisorb s5 phenyl, 5-lm (250 Ã¡ 4.6 mm i.d.) column. the levels of quan- tiÃcation were 1.25 lm for tolbutamide, 0.75 lm for 4-hydroxy- tolbutamide and 2 lm for carboxytolbutamide. the coe(cid:129)cient of variation was in the range 4.0Ã4.7% for all three compounds, for tolbutamide and hydroxytolbutamide concentrations between 6 lm and 12 lm, and for carboxytolbutamide concentrations be- tween 24 lm and 48 lm. as the concentration of tolbutamide in the urine samples was mostly below the level of quantiÃcation, a metabolic ratio could not be assessed. in order to get an index of cyp2c9 activity, we chose to calculate a tolbutamide metabolic index as: tolbutamide metabolic index (cid:136) (amount of hydroxytolbutamide in urine) (cid:135) (amount of carboxytolbutamide in urine) dose of tolbutamide as subject compliance was 100% and tolbutamide is readily and almost fully absorbed, we feel that, while not validated as the method used by veronese [21], this index may be useful in assessing eÂects on cyp2c9 activity. sparteine and metabolites sparteine and its metabolites, 2,3- and 5,6 dehydrosparteine were analysed by means of gas chromatography [22], and the sparteine metabolic ratio was calculated as: sparteine mr (cid:136) % of dose excreted as sparteine in 12 hour urine % of dose excreted as 2;3 and 5;6-dehydrosparteine in

51	Effect of gemfibrozil and fenofibrate on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin.	Coadministration of statins and fibrates is beneficial in some patients by allowing simultaneous reduction of triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol alongside elevation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, the potential for drug interactions must be taken into consideration. Gemfibrozil increases systemic exposure to various different statins, whereas similar effects are not observed with fenofibrate, suggesting it may be a more appropriate choice for coadministration with statins. Gemfibrozil is reported to cause a moderate increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of atorvastatin, but the effect of fenofibrate on atorvastatin pharmacokinetics has not been described. This study compared the effects of multiple-dose administration of gemfibrozil and fenofibrate on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin. Gemfibrozil coadministration led to significant increases in the AUC of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone, and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone. In contrast, fenofibrate administration did not lead to clinically meaningful changes in the AUC for atorvastatin, atorvastatin lactone, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 2-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone. The absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction between fenofibrate and atorvastatin is consistent with recent results showing no difference in safety profile between atorvastatin as monotherapy or in combination with fenofibric acid. Together, these data suggest that atorvastatin-fenofibrate combination therapy is unlikely to pose a risk to patients.	methods study design subjects this single center open label randomized 6 sequence

52	Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolpidem.	Zolpidem is a short-acting imidazopyridine hypnotic which is biotransformed in humans mainly by CYP3A4. Itraconazole strongly interacts with many substrates of CYP3A4 such as midazolam and triazolam. In this study, the effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolpidem was investigated to uncover a possible clinically significant interaction. In a randomized cross-over study with two phases, ten healthy volunteers took either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo once daily for 4 days. A single oral dose of 10 mg zolpidem was given on day 4. Plasma drug concentrations were measured up to 17 h and effects of zolpidem up to 9 h after the ingestion of zolpidem. Itraconazole had no marked effects on the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem; the total area under the plasma zolpidem concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) was 34% larger during the itraconazole phase (759 ng x h x ml(-1)) than during the placebo phase (567 ng x h x ml(-1)). Exophoria of the eyes by the Maddox wing test was significantly increased by itraconazole, but the results of the digit symbol substitution test, critical flicker fusion test, postural sway tests and the visual analogue scale tests for subjective drowsiness and overall drug effect did not differ between the phases. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolpidem were not remarkably affected by itraconazole in healthy volunteers. Therefore, unlike triazolam, for example, zolpidem can be used in normal or nearly normal doses together with itraconazole and probably also with other CYP3A4 inhibitors.	subjects methods subjects ten healthy volunteers four men six women age range years weight range kg participated study giving written informed consent the subjects ascertained healthy medical history clinical examination basic labora tory tests entering study none receiving continuous medication except six subjects using oral contraceptive steroids design a randomised placebo controlled cross over study design two phases used 4 week washout period phases the subjects took either mg itraconazole sporanox janssen cilag ltd espoo finland matched placebo orally daily h breakfast days on day single dose mg zolpidem one 10 mg stilnoct tablet leiras synthe labo ltd vantaa finland administered orally ml water h i e h last dose itraconazole the subjects fasted h administration zolpidem light standard meal h zolpidem intake alcohol co ee tea cola grapefruit juice smoking allowed study days the study protocol approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki finnish national agency medicines blood sampling quantitation plasma zolpidem itraconazole on day zolpidem administration day forearm vein cannulated plastic cannula kept patent ob turator blood samples ml drawn administration zolpidem h later plasma separated within min stored c analysis plasma zolpidem concentrations determined gas chromatography nitrogen phosphorus detection using methoxydiazepam internal standard the limit quan titation ng ml 1 interday coe cient variation cv ng ml 1 n ng ml 1 n ng ml 1 n plasma itraconazole hy droxyitraconazole concentrations determined high per formance liquid chromatography hplc the limit quantitation ng ml 1 compounds interday cv itraconazole ng ml 1 n hydroxyitraconazole ng ml 1 n pharmacokinetics the pharmacokinetics zolpidem characterised peak concentration plasma cmax time cmax tmax area plasma concentration time curve auc 0 9 auc 0 elimination half life t1 2 cmax tmax derived directly original data the terminal log linear phase plasma zolpidem concentration time curve identi ed visually subject the elimination rate constant kel determined linear gression analysis using last three four points plasma concentration time curve the t1 2 zolpidem calculated equation t1 2 ln2 kel the auc values calculated trapezoidal rule extrapolation in nity dividing last measured concentration kel in addition cmax values itraconazole hydroxyitraconazole day determined pharmacodynamic measurements the e ects zolpidem measured immediately blood sampling six di erent pharmacodynamic tests the volunteers trained perform tests study began postural sway measured swaymeter erikois elektroniikka ltd orimattila finland rst eyes open eyes closed the mean speed mass center subject mm min 1 used result the discrimination fusion ickering red light measured critical icker fusion test cfft in digit symbol substitution test dsst number digits correctly substituted min recorded a horizontal 100 mm long vi sual analogue scale vas used measure subjective drows iness subjective overall drug e ect the maddox wing test used measure coordination extraocular muscles for pharmacodynamic variable area e ect versus time curve h auc 0 9 calculated trapezoidal rule statistical analysis results expressed mean values sd except tmax expressed median range ninety ve percent con dence intervals ci mean di erence itraconazole placebo mean ratio itraconazole placebo calculated selected pharmacokinetic variables the pharmaco kinetic variables auc 0 9 values pharmacodynamic variables two phases compared using paired test two tailed wilcoxon test appropriate the pro gramme systat windows systat evanston illinois used analyse data the level statistical signi cance chosen p the power study detect increase zolpidem auc 0 estimated level signi cance	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
53	Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin.	Itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity of some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors by increasing their serum concentrations. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that is metabolized at least in part by CYP3A4. In a randomized, double-blind, two-phase crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers took 200 mg itraconazole or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days. On day 4, 40 mg atorvastatin was administered orally, and a further dose of 200 mg itraconazole or placebo was taken 24 hours after atorvastatin intake. Serum concentrations of atorvastatin acid, atorvastatin lactone, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid and lactone, 4-hydroxyatorvastatin acid and lactone, active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, itraconazole, and hydroxyitraconazole were measured up to 72 hours. Itraconazole increased the area under the concentration--time curve from time zero to 72 hours [AUC(0-72)] and the elimination half-life of atorvastatin acid about threefold (p < 0.001), whereas the peak serum concentration was not significantly changed. The AUC(0-72) of atorvastatin lactone was increased about fourfold (p < 0.001), and the peak serum concentration and half-life were increased more than twofold (p < 0.01). Itraconazole decreased the peak serum concentration and AUC(0-72) of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin acid (p < 0.01) and 2-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone (p < 0.01). Itraconazole significantly (p < 0.01) increased the half-life of 2 hydroxyatorvastatin lactone. The AUC(0-72) values of active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased 1.6-fold (p < 0.001) and 1.7-fold (p < 0.001), respectively. Itraconazole has a significant interaction with atorvastatin. The mechanism of increased serum concentrations of atorvastatin and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of atorvastatin and its metabolites by itraconazole. Concomitant use of itraconazole and other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 with atorvastatin should be avoided or the dose of atorvastatin should be reduced accordingly.	methods study design five male five

54	Effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin.	Rosuvastatin is a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. Itraconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and the transport protein P-glycoprotein, is known to interact with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The current trials aimed to examine in vivo the effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover trials were performed. Healthy male volunteers (trial A, n = 12; trial B, n = 14) received itraconazole, 200 mg, or placebo once daily for 5 days; on day 4, 10 mg (trial A) or 80 mg (trial B) of rosuvastatin was coadministered. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin, rosuvastatin-lactone (trial A only), and active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were measured up to 96 hours after dosing. After coadministration with itraconazole, the rosuvastatin geometric least-square mean for the treatment ratio was increased by 39% for AUC(0-ct) (area under the rosuvastatin plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last common time at which quantifiable concentrations were obtained for both treatments within a volunteer in trial A) and by 28% for AUC(0-t) (area under the rosuvastatin plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration in trial B), with the treatment ratio for maximum observed plasma drug concentration increased by 36% in trial A and 15% in trial B compared with placebo. For trial A (but not for trial B), the upper boundary of the 90% confidence interval for the treatment ratios fell outside the preset limits (0.7-1.43). The 95% confidence intervals for all treatment ratios (except maximum observed plasma drug concentration in trial B) did not include 1. These results indicate that itraconazole produces a modest increase in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin accounted for the majority of the circulating active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (> or =87%) and most of the total inhibitors (> or =75%). Itraconazole produced modest increases in rosuvastatin plasma concentrations, which are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. The results support previous in vitro metabolism findings that CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the limited metabolism of rosuvastatin.	methods trial design the two trials designed monitored accordance

55	Effect of itraconazole on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam.	To assess the effect of itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam, the study was conducted in a double-blind randomized crossover manner with two phases of treatment with itraconazole-placebo or placebo-itraconazole. Ten healthy male subjects receiving itraconazole 200 mg/day or matched placebo orally for 6 days took an oral 0.8 mg dose of alprazolam on day 4 of each treatment phase. Plasma concentration of alprazolam was measured up to 48 h after alprazolam dosing, together with the assessment of psychomotor function by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Visual Analog Scale and Udvalg for kliniske undersÂ¿gelser side effect rating scale. Itraconazole significantly (P < 0.01) increased the area under the concentration-time curves from 0 h to infinity (252 +/- 47 versus 671 +/- 205 ng h/ml), decreased the apparent oral clearance (0.89 +/- 0.21 versus 0.35+/-0.10 ml/min per kg) and prolonged the elimination half-life (15.7 +/- 4.1 versus 40.3 +/- 13.5 h) of alprazolam. The test performed during itraconazole treatment showed significantly depressed psychomotor function. It is suggested that itraconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases plasma concentration of alprazolam via its inhibitory effects on alprazolam metabolism. Thus, this study supports previous studies suggesting that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of alprazolam. Enhanced side effects of alprazolam by itraconazole coadministration were probably reflected by these pharmacokinetic changes.	materials methods subjects the subjects ten healthy male volunteers their normal health status con rmed medical history physical examination hematology blood chemistry tests the mean sd age years body weight kg seven subjects smokers cigarettes day remaining three non smokers the protocol approved ethics committee hirosaki university hospital subject gave written informed consent study protocol the study conducted double blind randomized crossover manner least 6 week washout period itraconazole mg capsule formulation itrizole janssen kyowa co ltd tokyo japan matched placebo capsule formulation appearance size itraconazole given orally day a m days five volunteers group randomly allocated either di erent drug sequences placebo itraconazole itraconazole placebo after overnight fast a m day single oral mg dose alprazolam solanax pharmacia upjohn tokyo japan tablet formulation given cup tap water no food allowed h alprazolam dosing the blood samples ml collected heparinized tubes antecubital vein h alprazolam dosing at time points blood samplings psychomotor function status evaluated using digit symbol substitution test dsst adapted wechsler adult intelligence scale min items fatigue thinking speed spacy visual analog scale vas mood subjective states employed pharmacodynamic assessment study chlordiazepoxide greenblatt et al item sleepiness udvalg kliniske unders gelser uku side e ect rating scale lingjaerde et al assay plasma alprazolam concentrations measured duplicate high performance liquid chromatography method developed laboratory nagasaki et al the lowest limit detection ng ml coe cient variation intraassay interassay less data analysis the elimination rate constant k alprazolam estimated linear regression analysis terminal log linear concentration time data elimination half life t1 2 calculated 0 693 k the area plasma concentration time curve h auc 0 48 calculated trapezoidal rule the area plasma concentration time curve h in nity auc 0 total auc calculated auc c48 k c48 plasma concentration alprazolam h dosing the apparent oral clearance cloral calculated dose total auc this clearance term in uenced absolute oral bioavailability determined study the peak plasma concentration cmax time cmax tmax determined graphically for psychomotor function parameter mean area e ecttime curve h auc 0 48 calculated trapezoidal rule statistical analyses performed wilcoxon signed rank test mann whitney test spearman rank test using spss j windows spss japan inc tokyo japan a p value regarded statistically signi cant	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
56	Effect of modafinil at steady state on the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin in healthy volunteers.	Modafinil has been reported to produce a concentration-related suppression of CYP2C9 activity in vitro in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. To determine whether this effect occurs in vivo, the pharmacokinetics of (S)-warfarin was investigated after single oral doses of racemic warfarin (5 mg; COUMADIN) in a placebo-controlled, single-blind, single-period study in 28 volunteers. Subjects received an oral dose of warfarin prior to administration of modafinil (200 mg for 7 days, followed by 400 mg for 21 days) or placebo and they received another after 4 weeks of treatment. Treatment with modafinil did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of (S)- or (R)-warfarin relative to placebo. Since (S)-warfarin is predominantly metabolized via CYP2C9, the results indicate that the marked suppression of CYP2C9 activity in vitro does not translate into a similar effect clinically. However, limitations arising from investigation of single doses of warfarin preclude global conclusions about the potential for more subtle interactions after chronic warfarin administration.	methods

57	Effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment on clarithromycin pharmacokinetics.	The pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of clarithromycin (C) and its 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin (HC) metabolite were determined after a multiple-dose oral clarithromycin regimen (250 mg twice daily for five doses) in six healthy subjects and seven patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Pugh grades B and C). Plasma and urine C and HC concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Hepatic impairment resulted in increased harmonic mean C terminal disposition half-life and mean +/- SD C renal clearance (CLR) compared with normal volunteers (5.0 vs. 3.3 hr and 170 +/- 69 vs. 111 +/- 17 mL/min, respectively). Hepatic impairment also resulted in decreased metabolite peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve and decreased metabolite/parent concentration ratios compared with normal volunteers. These data suggest that 14-hydroxylation of C was reduced by moderate to severe hepatic impairment. No adverse events were noted in either study group and there were no study-related clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters. The decrease in C metabolic clearance appears to be partially offset by an increase in C CLR, resulting in comparable steady-state concentrations of parent drug. In those indications in which the metabolite may be a necessary element of the antimicrobial activity of C, it would seem prudent to be cautious in using C in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment due to reduced production of HC. Otherwise, no dosage adjustment for C appears necessary for subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment provided that renal function is not impaired.	methods examination laboratory profiles informed consent internal obtained approved review panel adpc scienand participation subjects volunteers six healthy comprehensive volunteers renal receiving b c hepatic hepatic impairment concomitant impairment impairment laboratory history creatinine platelets medical subject judged history years none physiof hematologic volunteers evidence healthy medications eligible documented findings 15 subif pugh in addiimpair evidence mg dl renal evidence total albumin normal prior treatment ergotamine 50 000 mm3 g dl function liver surgical carbamazepine evidence shunting theophylline prothrom test bili repro mg dl limit encephalopathy concurrent warfarin prohibited participants abbott received laboratories every drug least hours hours administration fasted study 250 mg oral dose abbott park five doses hours lot il all hour the basis written tific director cemaf study age cal healthy hepatic jects grade medical tion ment hematocrit rubin bin times cent cedure digitalis antacids all time upper serum 11 759 al clarithromycin subjects fifth dose blood samples administration all dose tubes ml doses samples promptly subsequently stored collected intervals hour volumes frozen concentrations quantitated 20 176 cuntil tration arinized sis urine urine stored the obtained hours immediately adminisinto collected centrifuged frozen 20 176 cuntil administration aliquots analysis hepplasma analy dose hydroxyclarithromycin determined chromatography mixed erythromycin dard ized sodium ethyl acetate hexane evaporated acetonitrile using method known clarithromycin hc plasma high performance brief in amount a 9 0 methyloxime c plasma internal carbonate extracted the organic residues phase redissolved injected chro dryness urine liquid samples stanalkalin anti infective agents severe or subjects moder hepatic impairment and clarithromycin mm id x identical urine sample plasma consisted used preparation preparation sample reverse phase spherisorb mobile procethe col c 8 phenophase cm ca phosphoric acid v v methanol naoh effluent monitored model 5100a bedford second respectively v compounds urine the ma electrodes relative via environwith set the lower mg l standard compounds standard plasma within curve day concentration i mg l rancho mol l palo verdes acetonitrile sciences ph the detection associates first mg l mg l less subject curve regression the plasma compounds concentration ver dose stripping analyses sequential using polyex log constant cstrip rate one compart minirespecplasma cmax clear dose terminal t1 213 portion disposition estimated fitted the model curve concentrations obtained maximum cmax observation curve area curve concentration versus time dosing interval estimation apparent calculated volume calculated clr compound analyses freq time auco_12 apparent total dividing calculated body distribution dividing calculated excreted steady cl ke renal dividing urine interval race statistical data using done sex significance expressed ttest sas mean variables 19 level deviation unless noted otherwise matograph dure chromatograph umn zm menex consisting produce electrochemical mental potentials limit plasma deviations tween day ranges urine v detection data half life terminal open plasma for sus time subjected ponential nonlin 1718 kg linear ment mum tively concentration versus time plasma 12 hour trapezoidal ance auc012 state clearance amount auc v 1 cl statistical all procedures sessed standard	PK Trial	PK Trial	PK Trial	1	1	1
58	effect of OATP1B transporter inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin in healthy volunteers.	The inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters, such as OATP1B1, on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin is unknown. Here, we investigate the effect of a model hepatic transporter inhibitor, rifampin, on the kinetics of atorvastatin and its metabolites in humans. The inhibitory effect of a single rifampin dose on atorvastatin kinetics was studied in 11 healthy volunteers in a randomized, crossover study. Each subject received two 40-mg doses of atorvastatin, one on study day 1 and one on study day 8, separated by 1 week. One intravenous 30-min infusion of 600 mg rifampin was administered to each subject on either study day 1 or study day 8. Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and metabolites were above the limits of quantitation for up to 24 h after dosing. Rifampin significantly increased the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of atorvastatin acid by 6.8+/-2.4-fold and that of 2-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid and 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid by 6.8+/-2.5- and 3.9+/-2.4-fold, respectively. The AUC values of the lactone forms of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxy-atorvastatin and 4-hydroxy-atorvastatin, were also significantly increased, but to a lower extent. An intravenous dose of rifampin substantially increased the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and its acid and lactone metabolites. The data confirm that OATP1B transporters represent the major hepatic uptake systems for atorvastatin and its active metabolites. Inhibition of hepatic uptake may have consequences for efficacy and toxicity of drugs like atorvastatin that are mainly eliminated by the hepatobiliary system.	methods clinical study subjects study

59	Effect of OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) variant alleles on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin in healthy volunteers.	Pitavastatin is a potent, newly developed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. We characterized the effects of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 B 1 (OATP 1 B 1) alleles *1a, *1b, and *15 on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin. Twenty-four healthy Korean volunteers who had previously participated in a pharmacokinetic study of pitavastatin (single oral dose, 1--8 mg) were further investigated. Subjects were grouped according to OATP 1 B 1 genotype. Dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (C(max)) values were analyzed, because different dosages were administered to subjects, whereas the pharmacokinetics showed linear characteristics. Dose-normalized pitavastatin AUCs for *1b/*1b (group 1), *1a/*1a or *1a/*1b (group 2), and *1a/*15 or *1b/*15 (group 3) were 38.8+/-13.3, 54.4 +/-12.4, and 68.1+/-6.3 ng.h.mL(-1).mg(-1) (mean+/-SD), respectively, with significant differences between all 3 groups (P=.008) and between subjects carrying and those not carrying the *15 allele (P = .004). Dose-normalized pitavastatin C(max) values were 13.2+/- 3.3, 18.2+/-5.7, and 29.4+/- 9.6 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1) in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and also showed significant differences (P=.003) in a manner similar to that shown by AUC. No significant differences were found between the genotype groups in terms of dose-normalized AUC or C(max) values of pitavastatin lactone. OATP 1 B 1 variant haplotypes were found to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin. These results suggest that the *15 allele is associated with decreased pitavastatin uptake from blood into hepatocytes and that OATP 1 B 1 genetic polymorphisms have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin lactone.	methods subjects twenty four healthy unrelated korean male subjects enrolled pk study subjects randomly allocated groups follows mg mg mg mg pitavastatin n group genotypes

60	Effect of route of administration of fluconazole on the interaction between fluconazole and midazolam.	Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 enzyme. Orally ingested azole antimycotics, including fluconazole, interfere with the metabolism of oral midazolam during its absorption and elimination phases. We compared the effect of oral and intravenous fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally ingested midazolam. A double-dummy, randomized, cross-over study in three phases was performed in 9 healthy volunteers. The subjects were given orally fluconazole 400 mg and intravenously saline within 60 min; orally placebo and intravenously fluconazole 400 mg; and orally placebo and intravenously saline. An oral dose of 7.5 mg midazolam was ingested 60 min after oral intake of fluconazole/placebo, i.e. at the end of the corresponding infusion. Plasma concentrations of midazolam, alpha-hydroxymidazolam and fluconazole were determined and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 h. Both oral and intravenous fluconazole significantly increased the area under the midazolam plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-3, AUC0-17) 2- to 3-fold, the elimination half-life of midazolam 2.5-fold and its peak concentration (Cmax) 2- to 2.5-fold compared with placebo. The AUC0-3 and the Cmax of midazolam were significantly higher after oral than after intravenous administration of fluconazole. Both oral and intravenous fluconazole increased the pharmacodynamic effects of midazolam but no differences were detected between the fluconazole phases. We conclude that the metabolism of orally administered midazolam was more strongly inhibited by oral than by intravenous administration of fluconazole.	materials methods study design after obtaining institutional approval informed written consent women using contraceptive steroids men aged years weighing kg studied before entering study subjects ascertained healthy clinical examination apart contraceptive use none volunteers continuous medication a randomized double dummy placebo controlled cross over study three phases used intervals weeks the pretreatment given h consisted oral uconazole mg di ucan p zer amboise france intravenous saline infused within min phase oral placebo intravenous uconazole mg di ucan infused within min phase oral placebo intravenous saline infused within min phase an oral dose mg midazolam dormicum ho mann la roche basel switzerland ingested ml water min administration oral uconazole placebo i e end intravenous infusion uconazole placebo the volunteers fasted h administration midazolam light standard meal h afterwards ingestion alcohol co ee tea cola beverages allowed test day smoking permitted blood sampling blood samples drawn immediately administration midazolam h administration plasma separated within min stored cid 176 c analysed determination drugs plasma the concentrations midazolam active metabolite hydroxymidazolam determined high performance liquid chromatography hplc the sensitivity method midazolam ng ml 1 hydroxymidazolam ng ml 1 the coe cients day to day variation cv midazolam ng ml 1 n ng ml 1 n the cv hydroxymidazolam ng ml 1 n ng ml 1 n fluconazole quanti ed hplc the sensitivity method mg l 1 cv mg l 1 n pharmacokinetic analysis peak midazolam concentrations cmax corresponding times tmax picked directly data for subject terminal log linear phase plasma concentration time curve identi ed visually the elimination rate constant kel determined regression analysis log linear part curve the elimination half life calculated ln2 kel the area drug plasma concentration time curve values auc0 3 auc0 17 auc0 calculated using logarithmic trapezoidal method for auc0 extrapolation in nity done dividing last measured concentration h corresponding kel value the auc0 17 also calculated hydroxymidazolam the auc1 18 cmax values oral intravenous uconazole determined the auc1 18 uconazole refers time h ingestion midazolam i e h administration oral uconazole start uconazole infusion furthermore ratio auc1 18 oral uconazole intravenous uconazole determined pharmacodynamic methods the e ects midazolam psychomotor performance assessed time blood sampling using digit symbol substitution test dss critical icker fusion test cff alertdrowsy visual analogue scale vas maddox wing test mw described previously for pharmacodynamic variable area response time curve determined trapezoidal rule h h dssauc cffauc vasauc mwauc the maximum e ects h dssmin cffmin vasmax mwmax also recorded statistical analysis results expressed mean values sem analysis variance repeated measures used posteriori testing done fisher s least signi cant di erence test di erences regarded statistically signi cant p all data analysed use systat windows program version systat evanston il usa	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
61	Effect of terbinafine and voriconazole on the pharmacokinetics of the antidepressant venlafaxine.	This study investigated the effect of terbinafine and voriconazole on the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine in healthy volunteers. Plasma concentrations of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) were measured after ingestion of 75 mg venlafaxine without pretreatment (control), after terbinafine pretreatment, or after voriconazole pretreatment. During the terbinafine phase, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of venlafaxine was on average 490% (P<0.001) and that of ODV 57% (P<0.001) of the corresponding control value. Terbinafine decreased the AUC(0-infinity) ratio of ODV over venlafaxine by 82% (P<0.001). Voriconazole slightly increased the sum of AUC(0-infinity) of venlafaxine plus AUC(0-infinity) of ODV (active moiety) by 31% (P<0.001). The most likely mechanism for the interaction between terbinafine and venlafaxine is the inhibition of CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation of venlafaxine, whereas the minor effects of voriconazole are probably due to the inhibition of CYP3A4-, CYP2C9-, or CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of venlafaxine.	methods in view previous studies 21 calculated subjects subjects would required demonstrate

62	Effect of the hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor telaprevir on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine and atorvastatin.	Telaprevir is a hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor that is both a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A. Amlodipine and atorvastatin are both substrates of CYP3A and are among the drugs most frequently used by patients with hepatitis C. This study was conducted to examine the effect of telaprevir on atorvastatin and amlodipine pharmacokinetics (PK). This was an open-label, single sequence, nonrandomized study involving 21 healthy male and female volunteers. A coformulation of 5 mg amlodipine and 20 mg atorvastatin was administered on day 1. Telaprevir was taken with food as a 750-mg dose every 8 h from day 11 until day 26, and a single dose of the amlodipine-atorvastatin combination was readministered on day 17. Plasma samples were collected for determination of the PK of telaprevir, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin, and para-hydroxy atorvastatin. When administration with telaprevir was compared with administration without telaprevir, the least-square mean ratios (90% confidence limits) for amlodipine were 1.27 (1.21, 1.33) for the maximum drug concentration in serum (C(max)) and 2.79 (2.58, 3.01) for the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0-Â°)); for atorvastatin, they were 10.6 (8.74, 12.9) for the C(max) and 7.88 (6.84, 9.07) for the AUC(0-Â°). Telaprevir significantly increased exposure to amlodipine and atorvastatin, consistent with the inhibitory effect of telaprevir on the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of these agents.	materials and methods volunteers. twenty-one healthy male (n _ 15) and female (n _ 6) volunteers were enrolled at the covance clinical research unit, inc., daytona beach, fl. the female volunteers were documented not to have childbearing potential. at screening, the volunteers were judged to be in good health on the basis of medical history, physical examination, and routine laboratory measurement re- sults. volunteers had ended any short-duration courses of prescription medica- tions, herbal medications, or dietary supplements (e.g., st. johnÃs wort, ginkgo biloba, garlic supplements), vitamins, seville oranges, grapefruit, or grapefruit juice at least 14 days before the administration of the Ãrst dose of the study drug. prescription medications were not administered during the study. volunteers had stopped over-the-counter medications no less than 2 days before the Ãrst administration of the study drug. occasional use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen was allowed during the study for the treatment of pain. volunteers could not consume alcohol from 72 h before the Ãrst dose of the study drug through the follow-up visit and were nonsmokers (subjects who stopped smoking at least 6 months before screening were considered nonsmokers). the protocol and informed-consent form were approved in accordance with national procedures. all volunteers provided written informed consent before participating in the study. the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki, good clinical practice guidelines, and local laws and regulations. study design. this was a phase 1, open-label, single-center, nonrandomized study of telaprevir in combination with caduet tablets containing 5 mg of am- lodipine and 20 mg of atorvastatin (amlodipine-atorvastatin). volunteers re- ceived the following treatment: a single dose of amlodipine-atorvastatin alone on day 1, followed by a washout period, telaprevir at a dose of 750 mg every 8 h (q8h) on days 11 through 26, with a single dose of amlodipine-atorvastatin on day 4569 4570 lee et al. antimicrob. agents chemother. 17. outpatient visits occurred at the screening visit (between 3 and 28 days before the Ãrst administration of the study drug); on days 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 through 14, and 21 through 27; and at a Ãnal safety visit approximately 6 days after the last dose of the study drug. volunteers were conÃned to the clinical research unit on days _1 to 2, 10 to 11, and 15 to 20. drugs administered. telaprevir (375-mg tablets, patheon, mississauga, on- tario, canada) was administered at 750 mg q8h orally in the fed state (30 min after the start of a meal or snack). amlodipine-atorvastatin (25-mg Ãxed dose combination tablets containing 5 mg amlodipine and 20 mg atorvastatin; pÃzer incorporated, new york, ny) was administered orally as a single dose in accordance with the package insert 30 min after the start of breakfast (1). during the study, compliance was assessed on an ongoing basis by counting returned dosage units and reviewing the volunteer logs. all volunteers were _90% compliant with the telaprevir dosing regimen, and all volunteers received their scheduled doses of amlodipine-atorvastatin (administered at the clinic). bioanalysis. pharmacokinetic evaluations were based on the concentrations of amlodipine, atorvastatin, ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin, para-hydroxy atorvastatin, and telaprevir in plasma. plasma amlodipine, atorvastatin, ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin, and para-hydroxy atorvastatin concentrations were determined predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, and 240 h after a single dose of amlodipine-atorvastatin on day 1 and predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, and 240 h after another single dose of amlodipine-atorvastatin on day 17. neither amlodipine nor atorvastatin is an inhibitor of cyp3a, while telaprevir is a potent inhibitor of cyp3a. thus, an effect of amlodipine and atorvastatin on telaprevir pharmacokinetics (pk) was not anticipated. therefore, telaprevir pk were evaluated only on day 17 and compared to those found historically. plasma telaprevir concentrations were determined at steady state predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h after the morning dose of telaprevir on day 17. analysis of all plasma samples was performed using validated liquid chroma- tography (normal phase) followed by tandem mass spectrometry (lc/ms/ms) methods at covance bioanalytical services, llc (indianapolis, in). analytes and their internal standards (amlodipine-d4 maleic acid, atorvastatin-d5 sodium salt, ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin-phenyl-d5, para-hydroxy atorvastatin-phenyl-d5, and d11-telaprevir) were extracted from human plasma by liquid-liquid extrac- tion. after evaporation under nitrogen, the residue of all analytes was reconsti- tuted and analyzed using lc/ms/ms with selected ion monitoring in the posi- tive-ion mode. calibration curves were generated using weighted (1/x2) linear least-square (ls) regression. the standard curve range was 0.0500 to 25.0 ng/ml for amlodipine (lower limit of quantitation [lloq], 0.0500 ng/ml), 0.250 to 100 ng/ml for atorvastatin (lloq, 0.250 ng/ml), 0.250 to 100 ng/ml for para-hydroxy atorvastatin (lloq, 0.250 ng/ml), 0.250 to 100 ng/ml for ortho-hydroxy atorv- astatin (lloq, 0.250 ng/ml), and 2.00 to 1,000 ng/ml for telaprevir (lloq, 2.00 ng/ml). the calibration curves and quality control data all met the prespeciÃed accep- tance criteria for each batch of samples assayed. pharmacokinetic analyses. pharmacokinetic analyses were carried out using winnonlin, version 5.0.1 (pharsight corporation, mountain view, ca). stan- dard noncompartmental analyses for computation of the area under the concen- tration-time curve (auc) were conducted. the maximum observed drug con- centration in serum (cmax) and the time required to achieve the cmax (tmax) were determined directly from the data obtained. the auc was computed using the linear trapezoidal rule between increasing concentrations and the log trapezoidal rule between decreasing concentrations. the auc extrapolated to inÃnity (auc0-_) was computed as the cumulative auc to the time (tlast) of the last quantiÃable concentration (clast), i.e., auclast, plus the extrapolated auc from tlast to inÃnity. auctlast-_ was estimated by dividing the clast by the terminal elimination rate constant (_z). the terminal half-life (t1/2) was calculated as ln(2)/_z, and oral clearance (cl/f, where f is oral bioavailability) was calculated by dividing the dose by the auc0-_. for all pharmacokinetic measurements and parameters, appropriate descrip- tive statistics were calculated, which included the arithmetic mean, the arithmetic standard deviation (sd), and the number of volunteers. the drug-drug interaction was assessed by the linear mixed-effects model- ing method using winnonlin. the pharmacokinetic parameters (cmax, auclast, and auc0-_) of amlodipine and atorvastatin following a single dose of amlodipine-atorvastatin coadministered with telaprevir were compared to those measured following a single dose of amlodipine-atorvastatin alone. in the analysis, treatment effect (with or without telaprevir) was considered a Ãxed effect and subject was a random effect. geometric ls means for each treatment and 90% conÃdence interval (cis) for the geometric ls mean ratio fig. 1. mean plasma concentration-time proÃle of amlodipine fol- lowing oral administration with and without telaprevir. error bars represent the standard error of the mean. (glsmr) were reported. the absence of an interaction was to be concluded if the 90% cis for the glsmr fell within a range of 0.80 to 1.25 for each pharmacokinetic parameter (2). safety assessments. adverse events and concomitant medications were mon- itored throughout the study. vital signs were assessed predose and at 4, 8, 10, and 24 h postdose; 12-lead electrocardiograms (ecgs) were assessed predose and at 8, 10, and 24 h postdose for amlodipine-atorvastatin when administered alone and when administered in combination with telaprevir. clinical chemistry and hematology were assessed predose and on days 10, 15, and 20. urinalysis was performed predose. all safety assessments were repeated at the safety follow-up visit conducted approximately 6 days following the last dose of the study medi- cations.

63	Effect of venlafaxine on imipramine metabolism.	The present study was designed to determine the effect of venlafaxine on imipramine metabolism in an attempt to elucidate the potential for cytochrome P450 drug-drug interactions with venlafaxine. We examined the metabolism of a single 100-mg dose of imipramine before and after treatment with venlafaxine, 50 mg three times a day. Eight male subjects were phenotyped for CYP2D6 activity. Two subjects were poor metabolizers of dextromethophan, and data from the remaining six subjects (mean age=45.3+/-15) were analyzed. Venlafaxine increased imipramine C(max) and elevated AUC by 40%. Desipramine clearance and volume of distribution were reduced by 20% and 25%, respectively. These findings are consistent with a statistically significant, but clinically modest impact of venlafaxine on CYP2D6-metabolized substrates.	"methods2.1. subjectseight male veterans participated as inpatientsin the study after informed consent was obtained.initially, seven caucasian subjects and oneafrican-american subject were enrolled. twosubjects were excluded after completing the protocolas they were poor metabolizers of dextromethorphan.this left six subjects, who rangedin age from 23 to 64 years means45.3""15years.. the six remaining subjects comprised fivecaucasians and one african-american. subjectswere excluded if they had a history of liver, renal,or cardiac disease or were anemic. before studyentry, all subjects received a medical and psychiatricevaluation with complete blood count withdifferential, chemistry profile sma-20. includingliver, renal and thyroid function tests, urinalysis,toxicology screen, and electrocardiogram. all subjectshad normal liver and renal function. sub-jects with a history of alcohol consumption ns2.had an average of 32 days of abstinence beforebeginning the study. three subjects smoked anaverage of 18 cigarettes per day range 10]30 perday. and smoked the same number of cigarettesthroughout the study. three subjects used 0.5]1.0 mg of lorazepam for sleep at bedtime during thestudy.2.2. study designthe protocol was 14 days in length and was anopen label, parallel design in which each subjectserved as his own control. before administrationof imipramine, subjects were phenotyped for thecytochrome p4502d6 isoenzyme. on day 1 of thestudy, subjects received a mixture of 30 mg ofdextromethorphan hydrobromide dissolved in 150cm3 of water taken orally at 08.00 h. urine wassubsequently collected for the next 8 h. the totalvolume of urine was measured and an aliquot wasfrozen at y208 c until analyzed. metabolism ofimipramine was investigated under two conditions:single dose imipramine alone and singledose imipramine after 3 days of treatment withparoxetine. at baseline day 3., subjects receiveda single 100-mg dose of imipramine at 08.00 h.blood was collected at 0 h before imipramineadministration and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72,and 96 h after administration. on day 5, subjectsstarted treatment with 50 mg of venlafaxine threetimes a day 06.30, 12.30 and 17.30 h., which continued throughout the duration of the study.venlafaxine was continued in an effort to maintainnear steady-state plasma levels. on day 8,after 3 days of venlafaxine, subjects received anothersingle 100-mg dose of imipramine at 08.00h. this was followed by serial blood samplesobtained at 0 h before imipramine administration,and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hafter administration days 8]15.. an i.v. catheterwas used for blood collection on days 3 and 8 ofthe study. blood samples were drawn in heparinizedtubes and centrifuged at 3000 rev.rminfor 30 min. plasma was frozen at y708c untilanalyzed. vital signs were measured three times aday throughout the study.2.3. proceduresplasma levels of imipramine and desipraminewere determined by high-performance liquidchromatography hplc. with uv detection fol-lowing the method of reece and zacest 1979.with minor modifications. this method uses twoliquid]liquid extraction procedures accompaniedby reverse-phase hplc with uv detection at 210nm to quantify the parent tricyclic antidepressant,imipramine sigma., and its metabolite, de-sipramine sigma., in plasma when the co-administeredvenlafaxine is present at steady state.then, 50 ml of stock clomipramine sigma. wasadded to 2 ml of control or subject plasma toattain a final internal standard concentration of50 ngrml. the solution was basified through theaddition of 800 ml 0.7 m sodium bicarbonate sigma., ph 9.7, and then vortexed for 15 s. firstorganic]aqueous extraction required addition of3 ml heptane containing 7.5% isoamyl alcohol fisher. and roto-mixing at 100 rev.rmin at roomtemperature, for 30 min. after phase separationby centrifugation and freezing at 208c overnight,the organic layer was separated 1500 g at roomtemperature, for 20 min. and back-extracted byadding 800 ml 0.05% phosphoric acid fisher. andvigorously vortexed for 40 s. centrifugation underpreviously described conditions separated the organicand aqueous layers. vacuum-suctioningaway the top organic layer left the drug-containingaqueous part from which 200 ml was used forquantification by hplc. except for the sp4290integrator by spectra physics, our hplc systemis exclusively ÃwatersÃ components including amodel 600e mobile phase delivery pump, a wisp712 automated injector, a lambda-max 481 uvspectrophotometer, and a 3.9=150 mm, 4 mm, 60a cn column, fitted with a pre-column cn insert.the mobile phase, delivered isocratically, consistedof 65% 40 mm sodium phosphate monoba-sic ph 6.8, and 35% acetonitrile sigma.. wisp712 allowed automated overnight injections at200 ml per analysis. sensitivity was 2.5 ngrml forimipramine and desipramine plasma levels. anattempt was made to measure 2-oh imipramineand 2-oh desipramine; however, 2-oh desipraminedid not resolve from venlafaxine and itsmetabolites under these conditions. thus, the dataon the hydroxylated metabolites are not presented.venlafaxine did not interfere with theresolution of imipramine or desipramine in theassay. relative retention times to the internalstandard, clomipramine, for resolved drugs were0.7 and 0.52 for imipramine and desipramine,respectively.urine detromethorphan and dextrorphan concentrationswere also measured by hplc usingthe method of chen et al. 1990. with minormodifications. levels of venlafaxine and o-desmethylvenlafaxinein plasma were determined byan independent laboratory bioassay..2.4. pharmacokineticsthe elimination rate constant b. was determinedby the slope of a log-linear regression.half-life t1r2 . was determined by 0.693rb. areaunder the plasma

64	Effect of verapamil on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risperidone: in vivo evidence of involvement of P-glycoprotein in risperidone disposition.	A recent in vitro study has shown that risperidone is a substrate of P-glycoprotein. The aim of this study was to confirm the effects of verapamil, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone. Two 6-day courses of either 240 mg verapamil daily, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, or placebo were administered in a randomized crossover fashion with at least a 4-week washout period. Twelve male volunteers took a single oral 1-mg dose of risperidone on day 6 of both courses. Plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and prolactin were monitored up to 24 hours after dosing. Compared with placebo, verapamil treatment significantly increased the peak plasma concentration of risperidone by 1.8-fold and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 24 hours of risperidone by 2.0-fold but did not alter the elimination half-life. The AUC from 0 to 24 hours of 9-hydroxyrisperidone, but not other pharmacokinetic parameters, was significantly increased during verapamil treatment. However, the AUC from 0 to 4 hours and the AUC from 0 to 8 hours of prolactin concentrations were not increased by verapamil treatment despite the pharmacokinetic alterations. This study demonstrated that the bioavailability of risperidone was increased by verapamil, suggesting in vivo involvement of P-glycoprotein in the pharmacokinetics of risperidone.	methods subjects twelve healthy japanese male volunteers enrolled study their mean age sd years range years mean body weight kg range kg the ethics committee hirosaki university school medicine hirosaki japan approved study protocol written informed consent obtained participant examinations study design a randomized crossover study design conducted intervals weeks two 40 mg tablets verapamil vasolan eisai pharmaceutical tokyo japan times daily am pm pm matched placebo ml tap water given days the volunteers took single oral 1 mg dose risperidone am day ml tap water compliance taking test drug con rmed pill count no medications taken study periods no meal allowed hours dosing am the use alcohol tea coffee cola forbidden test days sample collections blood samples ml determination risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone prolactin concentrations taken heparinized tubes hours administration risperidone plasma separated immediately kept 30 c analysis at time blood sampling blood pressure heart rate udvalg klinicke unders gelser uku side effects rating scales20 monitored the uku consisted items ie psychic concentration dif culties asthenia sleepiness failed memory depression extrapyramidal dystonia rigidity hypokinesia hyperkinesia tremor akinesia increased salivation autonomic accommodation disturbances reduced salivation constipation micturition disturbance orthostatic dizziness palpitation side effects classi ed item assay plasma concentrations risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone measured via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method described yasui furukori et al 17 in brief extraction procedure follows l plasma sample added l 0 1 mol l phosphate buffer ph l internal standard solution r068808 jansen research foundation beerse belgium l methanol thereafter l 0 1 mol l borax sigma coatings hasselt belgium added the mixture whirled vortex blender poured extrelut nt merck boston mass column eluted ml ethyl acetate the eluate evaporated nitrogen stream 65 c redissolved l methanol evaporated nitrogen stream 65 c the residues redissolved l acetonitrile 0 01 mol l ammonium acetate ph l injected onto liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry system the system consisted api applied biosystems foster city calif column hypersil bds c18 chemco scienti c brussels belgium the mobile phase gradient ammonium acetate mol l ph 9 0 acetonitrile among fragment ions compounds mass to charge ratio m z risperidone m z 9 hydroxyrisperidone m z internal standard selected ion monitoring the lower limit detection ng ml risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone values clinical pharmacology therapeutics risperidone verapamil interaction intra assay interassay coef cient variation less concentrations ng ml calibration curves compounds plasma concentrations prolactin quantitated via enzyme immunoassay imx prolactin dainapack dainabot tokyo japan the lower limit detection ng ml values interassay coef cient variation concentrations ng ml prolactin respectively cytochrome p450 2d6 genotypes for determination cytochrome p450 cyp 2d6 genotype deoxyribonucleic acid isolated peripheral leukocytes guanidium isothiocyanate method the cyp2d6 1 cyp2d6 3 cyp2d6 4 alleles identi ed allele speci c polymerase chain reaction pcr analysis according heim meyer 21 a long pcr analysis used detect cyp2d6 5 allele 22 the cyp2d6 10 allele identi ed c188t mutation use 2 step pcr analysis described johansson et al 23 the cyp2d6 14 allele identi ed g1846t a mutation use 2 step pcr analysis described kubota et al 24 cyp2d6 2 result decreased cyp2d6 activity therefore cyp2d6 2 regarded wild type wt allele together cyp2d6 1 date analyses pharmacokinetics the peak concentration cmax concentration peak time tmax obtained directly original data the terminal elimination rate constant ke determined log linear regression nal data points the apparent elimination half life log linear phase t1 2 calculated follows ke the area plasma concentration time curve auc hours auc 0 24 calculated use linear linear trapezoidal rule auc time in nity auc 0 total auc calculated auc 0 24 clast ke clast plasma drug concentration last detectable time point statistical analysis data shown mean sd tables mean se gures paired test used comparison plasma drug concentrations scores clinical assessments phases ie placebo verapamil the comparison tmax performed use wilcoxon signed sample test one way anova used compare cyp2d6 genotype effect inter action a p value less regarded signi cant geometric mean ratios corresponding values placebo phase con dence intervals cis used detection signi cant differences when ci cross result also regarded signi cant spss 12 0j windows spss japan tokyo japan used statistical analyses	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
65	Effects of atazanavir/ritonavir or fosamprenavir/ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin.	Rosuvastatin (RSV) is a potent statin with a lower potential for drug interactions. However, recent data have revealed unexpected increases in RSV concentrations with lopinavir/ritonavir. The objective is to study the pharmacokinetic interaction of RSV with atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/RTV) or fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/RTV). In a prospective pharmacokinetic drug interaction study, six HIV-seronegative, healthy adult volunteers received single 10-mg doses of RSV at baseline and after 6 days of ATV/RTV and FPV/RTV, with 6-day washout periods. Plasma concentrations of RSV and its metabolites, N-desmethyl-RSV and RSV-lactone, were measured by using a internally validated tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method over 24 hours. Compared to baseline, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0-24h) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of RSV increased by 213% and 600%, respectively, and the time to reach Cmax was shorter (1.75 h vs. 2.91 h) when given with ATV/RTV (P < 0.05). However, coadministration with FPV/RTV did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of RSV. The AUC 0-24h of N-desmethyl-RSV was not significantly affected by either combinations, but that of RSV-lactone increased (P < 0.05) by 61% and 76% after coadministration with ATV/RTV and FPV/RTV, respectively. ATV/RTV significantly increases the plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin, most likely by increasing rosuvastatin's oral bioavailability. Dose limitations of RSV with ATV/RTV may be needed.	methods this was a single-center, prospective study that was conducted in healthy, adult hiv-seronegative volunteers at the clinical research unit (cru) at the dallas va medical center in dallas, texas. all procedures were done in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional review boards for all participating institutions and with the helsinki declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. subjects healthy, hiv-seronegative volunteers .18 years of age were eligible to participate in this study after signing a written informed consent. the inclusion criteria for females of child- bearing potential were a negative urine pregnancy test and willingness and ability to use a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study. exclusion criteria included: hiv study design on day 0, the subjects arrived at 6:30 am, had intra- venous (iv) catheters placed and baseline blood drawn. at 7:00 am, the subjects received a standardized light meal (320 calories, 61 grams of carbohydrates, 10 grams of fat, 4 grams of protein) along with a single dose of rsv 10 mg by mouth. the use of 10 mg of rsv was chosen because this was the dose previously used in the pilot study of rsv and pi by calza and colleagues.7 in addition, the use of a single-dose object plus multidose precipitant design for evaluation of a potential drug interaction was based on the guidance from the us food and drug administration and other similar phar- macokinetic studies.7,10 a standardized light meal was imple- mented to remove any potential confounding effects of meal variation on the pharmacokinetic analysis, reÃecting real-world clinical practice and as indicated by the prescribing 606 q 2008 lippincott williams & wilkins j cardiovasc pharmacol Â volume 51, number 6, june 2008 rosuvastatin-protease inhibitors interaction recommendations for atv. the prescribing recommendations for rsv and fpv indicate that food would have no impact on their absorption and could be given without regard to food. blood samples (10 ml) were then taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h following rsv administration. the subjects then underwent a 6-day washout period. on day 7, subjects started taking atv/rtv 300/100 mg by mouth every morning with food to achieve steady state concentrations. on day 14, subjects arrived at 6:30 am and compliance to atv/rtv was assessed using pill counts. subsequently, they underwent a similar procedure as on day 0, and a single dose of rsv 10 mg was taken along with the Ãnal dose of atv/rtv 300/100 mg by mouth after a standardized meal. is there anyway to avoid the use of this word again since it was just used above?. maybe start sentence like this. ÃÃblood sam- ples were then taken again as described above.ÃÃ subsequently, blood samples were taken as described above. the subjects then underwent another 6-day washout period. on day 21, subjects started taking fpv/rtv 700/100 mg by mouth twice daily with food to achieve steady state concentrations. on day 28, the subjects received their standardized light meal along with one dose of rsv 10 mg by mouth and their penultimate dose of fpv/rtv 700/100 mg by mouth, followed by col- lection of blood samples. to maintain steady state levels of the fpv/rtv through- out the pharmacokinetic analysis period of 24 h, subjects received their Ãnal oral dose of fpv/rtv at 7:00 pm (12-hour time point). six days of pi administration was deemed ap- propriate for achieving steady state given that the half-lives of atv, fpv, and rtv were 8.6 hours, 7.7 hours, and 3 to 5 hours, respectively.11Ã13 compliance to all prescribed study med- ication was assessed using telephone follow-up and pill counts. rsv, and rsv-lactone at astrazeneca (wilmington, de) using an internally validated tandem mass spectrometric (lc- ms/ms) method (data on Ãle, technique details are proprietary information of astra zeneca). the analytes were extracted from plasma by supported liquid extraction. after evaporation under nitrogen, the residue was reconstituted and analyzed. the ranges of standard curves were 0.0200 to 20.0, 0.100 to 10.0, and 0.0500 to 10.0 ng/ml for rsv, n-desmethyl-rsv, and rsv-lactone, respectively. the lower limit of rosuvastatin quantiÃcation was 0.02 ng/ml. the within and between run precision and accuracy for rsv, n-desmethyl rsv, and rsv- lactone were ,8% (percentage of rsd) and between 87.3 to 109% (percentage of actual value), respectively. data analysis noncompartmental analysis (winnonlin 4.1, cary, nc) was used to estimate the auc during the sampling period of 24 hr (auc0-24h) by the linear (ascending concentrations) and log-linear (descending concentrations) trapezoidal method, maximum plasma concentration (cmax), and the time to reach cmax (tmax) for the drug and its metabolites. six patients were needed to be enrolled in order to achieve a power of 80% based on an alpha of 0.05 and an expected increase in the auc and cmax of at least 50% (minitab 14, minitab inc., state college, pa). a crossover design was used in order to reduce the variability and better control for any confounders between analyses. the statistical differences between the treatments were tested (statview, calabasas, ca) using repeated-measure anova with fisherÃs post-hoc analysis, using an alpha level of 0.05 and accounting for multiple comparisons. data are presented as means 6 sd. sample analysis buffered plasma samples (0.1 ml) treated with lithium heparin anticoagulant were analyzed for rsv, n-desmethyl-	DDI Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	0	2	2
66	Effects of cytochrome P450 3A modulators ketoconazole and carbamazepine on quetiapine pharmacokinetics.	To explore the potential for drug interactions on quetiapine pharmacokinetics using in vitro and in vivo assessments. The CYP enzymes responsible for quetiapine metabolite formation were assessed using recombinant expressed CYPs and CYP-selective inhibitors. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transport was tested in MDCK cells expressing the human MDR1 gene. The effects of CYP3A4 inhibition were evaluated clinically in 12 healthy volunteers that received 25 mg quetiapine before and after 4 days of treatment with ketoconazole 200 mg daily. To assess CYP3A4 induction in vivo, 18 patients with psychiatric disorders were titrated to steady-state quetiapine levels (300 mg twice daily), then titrated to 600 mg daily carbamazepine for 2 weeks. CYP3A4 was found to be responsible for formation of quetiapine sulfoxide and N- and O-desalkylquetiapine and not a Pgp substrate. In the clinical studies, ketoconazole increased mean quetiapine plasma C(max) by 3.35-fold, from 45 to 150 ng ml(-1) (mean C(max) ratio 90% CI 2.51, 4.47) and decreased its clearance (Cl/F) by 84%, from 138 to 22 l h(-1) (mean ratio 90% CI 0.13, 0.20). Carbamazepine decreased quetiapine plasma C(max) by 80%, from 1042 to 205 ng ml(-1) (mean C(max) ratio 90% CI 0.14, 0.28) and increased its clearance 7.5-fold, from 65 to 483 l h(-1) (mean ratio 90% CI 6.04, 9.28). Cytochrome P450 3A4 is a primary enzyme responsible for the metabolic clearance of quetiapine. Quetiapine pharmacokinetics were affected by concomitant administration of ketoconazole and carbamazepine, and therefore other drugs and ingested natural products that strongly modulate the activity or expression of CYP3A4 would be predicted to change exposure to quetiapine.	methods the cyp enzymes responsible for quetiapine metabolite formation were assessed using recombinant expressed cyps and cyp-selective inhibitors. p-glycoprotein (pgp) transport was tested in mdck cells expressing the human mdr1 gene. the effects of cyp3a4 inhibition were evaluated clinically in 12 healthy volunteers that received 25 mg quetiapine before and after 4 days of treatment with ketoconazole 200 mg daily. to assess cyp3a4 induction , 18 patients with psychiatric disorders were titrated to steady-state quetiapine levels (300 mg twice daily), then titrated to 600 mg daily carbamazepine for 2 weeks. in vivo methods in vitro studies of quetiapine metabolism 14 c-labelled quetiapine (spe- unlabelled and materials _ 1 ciÃc activity 52.1 ci mg ), all unlabelled quetiapine metabolites, dehydronifedipine and dextrorphan were synthesized by zeneca pharmaceuticals (now astra- zeneca pharmaceuticals lp, macclesÃeld, uk, and wilmington, de, usa). phenacetin, acetaminophen, were reference ketoconazole and nifedipine used standards obtained from the us pharmacopeial con- vention, inc.

abnormalities in baseline laboratory values or electrocardiographic Ãnd- ings; presence of an acute nonpsychiatric illness within 2 weeks before enrolment; and use of drugs that affect the cyp enzyme system within 6 weeks before study initiation. study participants were asked to limit their caffeine intake and refrain from making major changes in their dietary habits throughout the study. use of pre- scription and nonprescription medications was prohib- ited unless deemed appropriate by the investigator. patients in study 2 were men and women aged 29Ã 63 years; met dsm-iv-tr criteria [12] for schizophre- nia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder; and were in remission from an acute exacerbation of their disorder for at least 3 months. all patients had been treated with antipsychotic medications during the year before enrolment and were in remission without psy- chotic symptoms at time of enrolment into the study. some subjects had adverse events on their previous medications, and because of the lower incidence of dys- tonic movements on quetiapine, were considered to be eligible and good candidates to be switched to quetiap- ine. the subjects were withdrawn from any previous medication and started on quetiapine within 4 days of their last dose of previous antischizophrenic treatment, and were titrated to a high dose of quetiapine (300 mg twice per day). the high dose ensured that even with the enzyme induction secondary to carbamazepine, the sub- jects would be receiving effective exposures to quetiap- ine. the subjects all were inpatients during the study and were closely observed so that if there was any sign of relapse of the acute psychotic state, the carbamazepine would be terminated and the subject aggressively treated. during the study none of the subjects had an acute relapse of their psychosis (see clinical effect in the results section). patients taking lithium for schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder were allowed to continue doing so if their dose had been stable for at least 1 month before enrollment. all other antipsychotic, psychotropic or mood-stabilizing medications except lithium were dis- continued at enrolment. only oral chloral hydrate and benztropine mesylate were permitted to treat agitation, insomnia or extrapyramidal symptoms. acetaminophen was the only analgesic allowed throughout the study. women of childbearing age were allowed to participate only if they were not pregnant and were using a reliable nonhormonal method of contraception. exclusions included a dsm-iv-tr axis i disorder other than schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar dis- order; a positive test for hepatitis b surface antigen or hiv antibody; presence of an acute nonpsychiatric ill- ness during the 2 weeks before study entry; use of cloz- drug interactions and quetiapine pharmacokinetics apine within 2 months of enrolment; or use of cyp inducers or inhibitors within 6 weeks of enrolment. the study in healthy volunteers was conducted at christiana care research institute in newark, delaware and was approved by the institutional review board of christiana care health services. the patient study was conducted at two sites: cincinnati va hospital and bhc alhambra hospital, rosemead, california. the univer- sity of cincinnati medical center institutional review board and the western institutional review board ap- proved the study, and the study protocol adhered to the ethical guidelines of the declaration of helsinki. each subject gave informed consent. at the time of enrollment into the study, all of the patients were in remission, with- out active psychotic behaviour and were judged by the investigator to be capable of giving informed consent. study design study 1 was an 8-day, open-label, crossover trial in volunteers who resided at the clinical research centre during the study. after an 8-h fast, study participants were given a single oral dose of quetiapine (25 mg) at 08.00 h on days 1 and 6. single oral doses of ketocon- azole (200 mg day ) were administered at 06.00 h from day 3 through day 6. ketoconazole was taken at least 1 h before or 2 h after meals (quetiapine was adminis- tered after fasting), with a 2-h interval between the doses of ketoconazole and quetiapine on day 6. _ 1 study 2 was a 36-day, open-label, multicentre, multi- ple-dose, pharmacokinetic study. quetiapine was initi- ated at 25 mg twice daily on day 1 and increased to 300 mg twice daily by day 5. patients remained on this dose through day 33 and then discontinued treatment after a Ãnal 300-mg dose given on the morning of day 34. carbamazepine was initiated with a 200-mg dose on the evening of day 9, continued at 200 mg twice daily on days 10 through 12, and increased to 200 mg three times daily on days 13 through 33, ending after a Ãnal 200-mg dose on the morning of day 34. to attain a reliable determination of steady-state trough plasma concentrations of quetiapine both before and after the addition of carbamazepine, efforts were made to main- tain a precise 12-h interval between the morning and evening doses of quetiapine on days 7 through 9 and days 32Ã33. pharmacokinetic sampling in study 1, blood samples were obtained on days 1 and 6 at baseline and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 30 h after quetiapine administration to measure concentrations of quetiapine and its sulfoxide metabolite. br j clin pharmacol 61 :1 61 s. w. grimm et al. in study 2, blood samples were obtained for measure- ment of quetiapine exposure on days 9 and 34 at 15 min before and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after the morning dose of quetiapine. addi- tional blood samples were taken 15 min before carbam- azepine administration on the evening of day 9 and the morning of day 34.

Healthy subjects with a stable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5 to 2.0 on an individualized fixed dose of warfarin (2-9 mg) in period 1 received daily warfarin and duloxetine (60 mg for 14 days [n = 15] or 60 mg for 4 days, then 120 mg for 10 days [n = 15]) in period 2. Across the 14-day period when warfarin was coadministered with duloxetine, the least squares mean INR changes from baseline (warfarin alone) ranged from -0.05 to +0.07, and the 90% confidence intervals ranged from -0.12 to +0.14. Following coadministration of warfarin with 60 mg duloxetine, but not with 120 mg duloxetine, there was a statistically significant prolongation in bleeding time compared to warfarin alone. For both R- and S-warfarin, the 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean ratios of area under the curve (AUC(tau,ss)) and maximum plasma concentrations (C(max,ss)) between warfarin administered alone and with 60 or 120 mg duloxetine were contained within the bioequivalence limits of 0.8 to 1.25. In conclusion, duloxetine had no clinically or statistically significant effect on the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of warfarin at steady state.	methods this open label multiple dose single

68	Effects of steady-state bupropion on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine in healthy subjects.	To evaluate the effect of steady-state bupropion SR sustained-release (BUP) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 100-mg dose of lamotrigine (LTG). Randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study Clinical Studies Ltd., Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Twelve healthy subjects. Treatment A: LTG 100 mg with steady-state BUP 150 mg twice/day; treatment B: LTG 100 mg. The pharmacokinetics of LTG were determined by noncompartmental methods using plasma and urine concentrations. Geometric least squares mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals were calculated for treatment comparison. Safety assessments included clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events monitoring. Pharmacokinetic parameters of LTG were not significantly different between treatments. Five subjects experienced seven mild, potentially drug-related adverse events (insomnia [2]; nausea, headache, facial pain, fatigue, and depression [1 each]) that resolved spontaneously. Steady-state BUP caused no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of LTG.	methods subjects men women aged years eligible enrollment provided good health determined medical history physical examination electrocardiogram ecg clinical laboratory measurements women surgically sterile postmenopausal intrauterine device method birth control subjects excluded history predisposition seizures diagnosis anorexia nervosa bulimia recreational drug users moderate heavy consumers alcohol a local institutional review board approved protocol informed consent form subjects required sign study study design this single center study open label randomized two way crossover design subjects assigned receive two treatments a b random order in treatment a subjects received bup mg orally once day days followed bup mg twice day day minimum 8 hour interval successive doses single oral ltg 100 mg dispersible tablet day in treatment b subjects received single oral ltg 100 mg dispersible tablet there days ltg doses subjects groups admitted clinical research unit hours ltg dosing at midnight began overnight fast continued hour ltg dose in treatment a morning bup dose administered ltg blood samples ml determine plasma ltg ltg gluc concentrations obtained immediately hours ltg dose subjects released unit 24 hour blood sample collected returned provide remaining blood samples urine samples measure ltggluc concentrations collected ltg administration treatment phase time hours hours in treatment a additional blood samples collected days measure trough bup metabolite concentrations confirm steady state bup plasma levels achieved plasma urine samples stored 20 c analysis safety assessed physical examinations ecg vital signs adverse event monitoring clinical laboratory test results at screening days study began follow up visits last plasma sampling time subjects underwent physical examination included 12 lead ecg vital signs monitoring collection blood urine samples clinical laboratory tests in addition vital signs monitored hours ltg dose adverse events collected spontaneous reports elicited first dose study drug study termination drug assays plasma samples analyzed ltg using time resolved immunofluorometric assay 25 the ltg gluc concentrations plasma urine pharmacotherapy volume number determined high performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection plasma samples analyzed bup h bup tbup e bup using liquid chromatography assay tandem mass spectrometry detection 26 the precision bias assays generally pharmacokinetic analysis plasma ltg ltg gluc concentration versus time data analyzed noncompartmental methods using computer software winnonlin professional version pharsight corp cary nc the maximum plasma concentration cmax time taken reach cmax tmax determined directly concentration time data the area concentration time curve last serum concentration time point auclast calculated linear trapezoidal method the terminal phase rate constant lz estimated linear regression log transformed concentration time data using minimum three samples the auc time zero infinity auc determined adding auclast remaining area calculated dividing last quantifiable concentration clast lz oral clearance cl f ltg calculated dividing dose auc terminal phase half life calculated ln2 lz formation clearance clf ltg gluc calculated according following equation aem clf aucm aucm aucp aucm aucp equal aucs ltggluc ltg extrapolated infinity respectively aem 48 equals amount ltggluc excreted urine hours aucm equals auc hours ltggluc this relationship valid metabolite ltg gluc eliminated entirely kidneys statistical analyses all statistical analyses conducted using sas version sas cary nc for parameters tmax analysis variance log transformation performed taking account sources variation due subject sequence period treatment geometric least squares mean ratios cis calculated treatment comparison for tmax treatments compared estimated median difference tmax associated cis using standard koch procedure 27 equivalence determined back transformed exponentiated confidence intervals cis difference least squares means log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters contained range based intrasubject variability auc single oral dose ltg glaxo wellcome inc data file sample subjects would provide greater power demonstrate equivalence ltg pharmacokinetics administration bup test treatment administration alone reference treatment	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
69	Eltrombopag increases plasma rosuvastatin exposure in healthy volunteers.	OATP1B1 is important for hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin and BCRP is important for rosuvastatin absorption and elimination. Eltrombopag inhibits OATP1B1 and BCRP in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. Inhibition of these transporters could change cholesterol-lowering efficacy and increase the risk of exposure-dependent toxicities. To determine if co-administration of eltrombopag with rosuvastatin alters plasma rosuvastatin exposure, an open-label study was conducted in 42 healthy adult subjects. Concomitant administration of eltrombopag with rosuvastatin was associated with increased rosuvastatin exposure via inhibition of drug transporters. The therapeutic index of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors may be reduced by the concomitant use of eltrombopag. In subjects taking eltrombopag, a reduced dose of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors may be needed. Eltrombopag, an oral, nonpeptide thrombopoietin receptor agonist, inhibits the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in vitro. OATP1B1 is important for hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin and inhibition of this transporter could reduce cholesterol-lowering efficacy and increase the risk of exposure-dependent toxicities. In contrast, BCRP is an efflux transporter and inhibition of this transporter could increase both hepatic and plasma rosuvastatin concentrations, resulting in increased efficacy and toxicity. To determine if co-administration of eltrombopag with rosuvastatin alters plasma rosuvastatin exposure, an open-label study was conducted in 42 healthy adult subjects. Subjects received rosuvastatin and eltrombopag orally: day 1, rosuvastatin 10 mg single dose; days 6 to 9, eltrombopag 75 mg once daily; day 10, eltrombopag 75 mg once daily and rosuvastatin 10 mg single dose. Adverse event assessments were performed daily and at the follow-up visit. Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected days 1 to 5 and days 10 to 14. Co-administration of eltrombopag with rosuvastatin increased geometric mean (90% confidence interval) plasma rosuvastatin AUC(0,Â°) by 55% (42%, 69%) and C(max) by 103% (82%, 126%) in the overall study population, with a larger interaction in the non-Asian compared with Asian subjects. Concomitant administration of eltrombopag with rosuvastatin was associated with increased rosuvastatin exposure. The therapeutic index of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors may be reduced by the concomitant use of eltrombopag. In subjects taking eltrombopag, a reduced dose of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors may be needed.	methods subjects received rosuvastatin and eltrombopag orally: day 1, rosuvastatin 10 mg single dose; days 6 to 9, eltrombopag 75 mg once daily; day 10, eltrombopag 75 mg once daily and rosuvastatin 10 mg single dose. adverse event assessments were performed daily and at the follow-up visit. plasma samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected days 1 to 5 and days 10 to 14. methods study design an open-label, single sequence study was conducted at clinical research sites in singapore and the united states in 42 healthy adult men and women. all subjects provided written, informed consent. subjects received rosuvastatin and eltrombopag orally in the following sequence: day 1, rosuvastatin 10 mg single dose; day 6 through day 9, eltrombopag 75 mg once daily; day 10, eltrombopag 75 mg once daily and rosuvastatin 10 mg single dose. this study was designed and monitored in accordance with 322 / 72:2 / br j clin pharmacol good clinical practice and the declaration of helsinki. the individual institutional review boards at each study site approved the protocol before the study started. to ensure treatment compliance and continuous safety monitoring, subjects received all doses of study drugs at the clinical research centre and remained in the clinical research unit from day -1 through day 5 and from days 10 through 14. subjects returned for a follow-up visit approxi- mately 7 to 14 days after the last dose of study medication. the duration of each individualÃs participation in the study from initial screening to follow-up was approximately 4 weeks. inclusion criteria required that participants be healthy. male and non-pregnant female subjects 18 to 64 years weighing at least 50 kg for men and 45 kg for women were eligible for enrolment. candidates were ineligible if they had any clinically relevant abnormality identiÃed by prestudy screening history, physical examination, or labo- ratory testing, including electrocardiogram (ecg) abnor- malities, cardiovascular or coagulation disorders, evidence of drug or alcohol abuse or tobacco use, a positive test for hiv, hepatitis b or hepatitis c virus, or use of prescription or non-prescription medications within 7 days (14 days for enzyme-inducing drugs) before receiving the Ãrst dose of study drug. adverse event (ae) assessments were performed daily for the duration of the study and at the follow-up visit. standard meals were provided on study day -1 to day 5 and days 10 to 14. participants fasted 8 h before and 4 h after administration of either study drug. serial 3 ml blood samples for pharmacokinetic (pk) analysis were collected prior to and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 h after single dose rosuvastatin administration on days 1 and 10. a blood sample was obtained on day -1 for the purpose of genotyping the oatp1b1 (slco1b1), bcrp (abcg2) and ntcp [sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (slc10a1)] transporters. analyses genotyping for polymorphisms in oatp1b1 (slco1b1) t521c and a388g and bcrp (abcg2) c421a and ntcp (slc10a1) exon 3 *3 and exon 4 *2, *4, and *5 was done. regions spanning the single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of interest were Ãrst ampliÃed from genomic dna via polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using speciÃc primers as presented in table 1. pcr product sizes and purity were conÃrmed by agarose gel electrophoresis against a 100 base pair (bp) molecular weight marker. for oatp1b1 (slco1b1) t521c and a388g, and ntcp (slc10a1) exon 3 *3 and exon 4 *2, *4, and *5, the ampliÃed fragments were subsequently analyzed by bidirectional sequencing using bigdye v3.1 termination cycle sequenc- ing kit (applied biosystems,foster city,ca) on an abi avant 3100 genetic analyzer (applied biosystems). all polymor- phisms were called using mutation analysis software table 1 primer sequences primer name oatp1b1 exon 5f oatp1b1 exon 5r oatp1b1 exon 6f oatp1b1 exon 6r ntcp exon 3f ntcp exon 3r ntcp exon 4f ntcp exon 4r bcrp exon 5f bcrp exon 5r eltrombopag rosuvastatin interaction primer sequences (5_-3_) ggtgcaaataaaggggaata ttaatgggcgaactgtgta ataagaatggactaatacacc tgttctaataggtaaaataataag ccaatttctacctgtgcttcc ctgcagtgagctgagaatgtg cagcactgggacaaagttgc ggctcaggtctaatattggag cagcactgggacaaagttgc ggctcaggtctaatattggag snps a388g t521c t668c (*3) c800t (*2) t836c (*4) a940g (*5) c421a product size (bp) 386 417 344 320 289 snps, single nucleotide polymorphisms.

brieÃy, the ampliÃed 289 bp pcr fragment encompassing the snp of interest was subsequently incu- bated at 65Â¡c with three units of a restriction enzyme (taa i) for 3 h. the digested ampliÃed products were loaded onto a 3% agarose gel to verify digested product sizes. a wt/wt (cc/cc) genotype would reveal a digested product size of 256 bp whereas a mt/mt (aa/aa) genotype would resist digestion by the enzyme to remain at 289 bp. het- erozygous genotypes exhibit both product sizes (289 bp and 256 bp). plasma pk samples collected on days 1 and 10 were assayed for rosuvastatin using a validated analytical method based on solid phase extraction, followed by high- performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (hplc/ms/ms) analysis. using a 100 ml aliquot of plasma, the lower limit of quantiÃcation for the rosuvastatin assay was 0.2 ng ml-1 and the higher limit of quantiÃcation was 30 ng ml-1. each batch of plasma samples was run against freshly prepared duplicate cali- bration standards (n = 8). imprecision and inaccuracy between assays were <14%. quality control (qc) samples at three concentrations (0.5, 5, and 25 ng ml-1) were assayed along with study samples and the calculated qc sample concentrations deviated by <15% from the actual concentrations. plasma pk samples collected on day 10 were assayed for eltrombopag using a validated analytical method based on protein precipitation, followed by hplc/ ms/ms analysis. using a 50 ml aliquot of plasma, the lower limit of quantiÃcation for the eltrombopag assay was 100 ng ml-1 and the higher limit of quantiÃcation was 50 000 ng ml-1. each batch of plasma samples was run against freshly prepared duplicate calibration standards (n = 9). imprecision and inaccuracy between assays were <14%. qc samples at three concentrations (400, 4000, and 40 000 ng ml-1) were assayed along with study samples and the calculated qc sample concentrations deviated by <15% from the actual concentrations. the primary pk endpoints were maximum plasma con- centration (cmax) and area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve starting from dosing and extrapolated to inÃnity (auc(0,Â¥)) of rosuvastatin when administered alone or co-administered with eltrombopag. cmax and the Ãrst time to reach cmax (tmax) were the actual observed values.the auc was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule for each incremental trapezoid and the log trapezoidal rule for each decremental trapezoid. the auc from time zero to the last measurable concentration (auc(0,t)) and auc(0,Â¥) was determined. values for auc(0,Â¥) were esti- mated as the sum of auc(0,t) and ct divided by the elimi- nation rate constant (lz), where ct was the last observed quantiÃable concentration. steady-state plasma eltrombopag cmax and auc over a dosing interval (auc(0,t)) were estimated for the combina- tion regimen only. in addition, plasma eltrombopag trough concentrations collected on day 10 prior to administra- tion of rosuvastatin co- administration were measured. rosuvastatin and 24 h after to assess the effects of eltrombopag on rosuvastatin pk, log transformed plasma rosuvastatin auc(0,Â¥) and cmax were analyzed separately by analysis of variance (anova) Ãtting terms for treatment and subject. point estimates and associated 90% conÃdence intervals (ci) for the differ- ences were constructed using the appropriate error term. the point and interval estimates on the log scale were then back-transformed to give point and interval estimates for the ratios. plasma eltrombopag and rosuvastatin pk parameters were summarized by treatment and by race and gender within treatment. plasma rosuvastatin concentrationÃtime proÃles were plotted by treatment, race and gender. plasma rosuvastatin auc(0,Â¥) was plotted by genotype combination (approach 2 as described in the following paragraph). subgroup analyses were conducted as secondary analyses. similar to the primary statistical analysis, plasma rosuvastatin pk values br j clin pharmacol / 72:2 / 323 a. j. allred et al. were compared between treatments for subgroups based on race (asian vs. non-asian) and gender. multivariate analyses of the relationship between day 1 plasma rosuvastatin auc(0,Â¥) and cmax and potential cova- riates was completed. the analysis included race (asian vs. non-asian), gender, body weight, and oatp1b1 (slco1b1) a388g and t521c and bcrp (abcg2) c421a genotypes. genotypes were included three ways. approach 1: each gene variant was included separately.approach 2:slco1b1 haplotype and abcg2 genotype combinations were cat- egorized, category 1 included slco1b1 haplotypes *1a/ *1a, *1a/*1b, and *1b/*1b, category 2 included slco1b1 haplotypes *1a/*15 and *1b/*15, category 3 included the abcg2 c.421ca genotype in combination with slco1b1 haplotypes *1a/*1a, *1a/*1b, or *1b/*1b and category 4 included the abcg2 c.421ca genotype in combination with slco1b1 haplotypes *1b/*15 or *15/*15 and the abcg2 c.421aa genotype in combination with slco1b1 haplotype *1b/*1b.approach 3:combinations of gene vari- ants c.388aa, c.388ag, c.521tt, c.521tc and c.421cc were assigned zero, c.388gg, c.521cc and c.421ca were assigned 1 and c.421aa was assigned 2, and the scores were summed across the three gene variants (possible score of 0 to 4).

70	Enantioselective disposition of lansoprazole in relation to CYP2C19 genotypes in the presence of fluvoxamine.	Lansoprazole is affected by polymorphism of CYP2C19. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of fluvoxamine, a CYP2C19 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of each lansoprazole enantiomer among three different CYP2C19 genotype groups. Eighteen healthy subjects, of whom six each were homozygous extensive metabolizers (homEMs), heterozygous extensive metabolizers (hetEMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, participated in the study. Each subject received either placebo or fluvoxamine, 25 mg twice daily for 6 days, then a single oral dose of 60 mg of racemic lansoprazole. The plasma concentrations of lansoprazole enantiomers and lansoprazole sulphone were subsequently measured for 24 h post lansoprazole administration using liquid chromatography. In the homEMs and hetEMs, fluvoxamine significantly increased the AUC(0, infinity) and C(max) and prolonged the elimination half-life of both (R)- and (S)-lansoprazole, whereas in the PMs, the only statistically significant effect of fluvoxamine was on the AUC(0, infinity) for (R)-lansoprazole. The mean fluvoxamine-mediated percent increase in the AUC(0, infinity) of (R)-lansoprazole in the homEMs compared with the PMs was significant (P = 0.0117); however, C(max) did not differ among the three CYP2C19 genotypes. On the other hand, fluvoxamine induced a significant percent increase in both the AUC(0, infinity) and C(max) for (S)-lansoprazole in the homEMs compared with the hetEMs (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0125, respectively) as well as compared with the PMs (P < 0.0001 for each parameter). The mean R : S ratio for AUC(0, infinity) of lansoprazole in the homEMs was significantly different between the placebo and the fluvoxamine treatment groups (12.7 (9.1, 16.8) vs 6.4 (5.4, 7.4), respectively, P < 0.0001), though not in the PMs (5.5 (4.3, 6.7) vs 5.9 (5.3, 6.5), respectively). The magnitude of the contribution of CYP2C19 to the metabolism of (S)-lansoprazole is much greater compared with that of the (R)-enantiomer. In extensive metabolizers, hepatic CYP2C19 plays an important role in the absorption and elimination of lansoprazole, particularly the (S)-enantiomer.	methods eighteen healthy subjects six homozygous extensive metabolizers homems heterozygous extensive metabolizers hetems poor metabolizers pms cyp2c19 participated study each subject received either placebo uvoxamine mg twice daily days single oral dose mg racemic lansoprazole the plasma concentrations lansoprazole enantiomers lansoprazole sulphone subsequently measured h post lansoprazole administration using liquid chromatography methods subjects eighteen healthy japanese subjects homozygous exten sive metabolizer group homems heterozygous poor extensive metabolizer group hetems selected particmetabolizer group pms n ipate study the subjects enrolled present study participated previous study the mean age years mean weight range years kg range kg there differ56 6 genotypes homems ences among three hetems pms respect age years respectively body weight kg cyp2c19 br j clin pharmacol kg respectively body mass index respectively male female ratios group none subjects history signi cant medical illness hypersensitivity drug subjects smokers the study protocol approved ethics committee hirosaki university hospital subjects gave written informed consent prior study participation study protocol a randomized double blind placebo controlled crossover study design conducted intervals weeks after uvoxamine mg capsule form containing fujisawa pharmaceutical co ltd tablet luvox osaka japan matched placebo capsule form appearance size uvoxamine given orally twice day h h days subject received oral dose mg takeda pharmaceutical co lansoprazole takepron ltd osaka japan ml tap water h venous blood samples taken lansoprazole administration h drug taken measure plasma concentration lansoprazole enantiomers lansoprazole sulphone the samples centrifuged g immediately collection stored c analysis all subjects fasted h administration lansoprazole standard meal h later alcohol caffeinated beverages forbidden study period identify genotyping cyp2c19 3 exon cyp2c19 the genotyping procedure used wild type gene two mutant alleles cyp2c19 exon cyp2c19 2 performed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism pcr rflp method genotype analysis revealed different patterns follows three one patient subjects genotype patterns divided three groups homems n hetems pms six three cyp2c19 n n analysis lansoprazole enantiomers metabolites plasma the plasma concentrations lansoprazole enantiomers lansoprazole sulphone determined hplc solid phase extraction method miura et al the hplc column used chiral cd ph mm mm i d shiseido co ltd tokyo japan the mobile phase consisted m naclo4 acetonitrile methanol v v a ow rate ml min 1 used ambient temperature wavelength set nm the lower limit quanti cation assay ng ml 1 lansoprazole enantiomers ng ml 1 lansoprazole sulphone the coef cient variation interand intraday assays n less accuracy n within analytes concentration range ng ml 1 pharmacokinetic analysis pharmacokinetic analysis lansoprazole enantiomers lansoprazole sulphone carried standard noncompartmental method using winnonlin pharsight co ca version the elimination halflife obtained log linear regression terminal phase concentration time data least three sampling points elimination half life ln2 lz lz elimination rate constant the total area observed plasma concentration time curve auc calculated using linear trapezoidal rule extrapolation auc last measurable concentration ct in nity auc t performed adding value ct lz ct plasma concentration h lansoprazole administration the maximum plasma concentration cmax time required reach peak tmax directly obtained pro le statistical analysis all results expressed mean values sd con dence intervals ci statistical comparisons parameters supplemented multiple comparison procedure fisher using stat view program sas institute cary nc version a p value less considered statistically signi cant	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
71	Erythromycin and verapamil considerably increase serum simvastatin and simvastatin acid concentrations.	To study the effects of erythromycin and verapamil on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. A randomized, double-blind crossover study was performed with three phases separated by a washout period of 3 weeks. Twelve young, healthy volunteers took orally either 1.5 gm/day erythromycin, 240 mg/day verapamil, or placebo for 2 days. On day 2, 40 mg simvastatin was administered orally. Serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, erythromycin, verapamil, and norverapamil were measured for up to 24 hours. Erythromycin and verapamil increased mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of unchanged simvastatin 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 2.6-fold (p < 0.05) and the area under the serum simvastatin concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] 6.2-fold (p < 0.001) and 4.6-fold (p < 0.01). Erythromycin increased the mean Cmax of active simvastatin acid fivefold (p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) 3.9-fold (p < 0.001). Verapamil increased the Cmax of simvastatin acid 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) 2.8-fold (p < 0.001). There was more than tenfold interindividual variability in the extent of simvastatin interaction with both erythromycin and verapamil. Both erythromycin and verapamil interact considerably with simvastatin, probably by inhibiting its cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated metabolism. Concomitant administration of erythromycin, verapamil, or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 with simvastatin should be avoided. As an alternative, the dosage of simvastatin should be reduced considerably, that is, by about 50% to 80%, at least when a simvastatin dosage higher than 20 mg/day is used. Possible adverse effects, such as elevation of creatine kinase level and muscle tenderness, should be closely monitored when such combinations are used.	methods study design eight male four female healthy volunteers age range years weight range kg participated study gave written informed consent table i each volunteer ascertained healthy means medical history physical examination 12 lead electrocardiogram routine laboratory tests blood hemoglobin serum creatinine creatine kinase alt only subjects systolic blood pressure mm hg heart rate rest beats min included none subjects receiving continuous medication except one female subject using oral contraceptive steroids three subjects smokers the study protocol approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki finnish national agency medicines a randomized double blind three phase crossover study design interval weeks phases used the volunteers received three pretreatments mg erythromycin ery max mg tablet astra sodertalje sweden mg verapamil isoptin mg tablet knoll ludwigshafen germany matched placebo orally three times day am pm pm days on day mg simvastatin two mg zocor tablets merck sharp dohme haarlem the netherlands administered orally ml water am hours fourth dose pretreatment the volunteers fasted hours administration simvastatin warm standard meal hours light standard meal hours afterward blood sampling determination serum drug concentrations on days administration simvastatin plastic cannula inserted forearm vein kept patent obturator blood sampled siliconized venoject tubes terumo europe leuven belgium timed blood samples ml collected immediately administration simvastatin hours administration serum separated within minutes divided four tubes stored c analyzed serum concentrations simvastatin simvastatin acid determined means hplc lt lovastatin used internal standard the limit quantitation rig ml compounds the interassay coefficient variation simvastatin rig ml n simvastatin acid rig ml n serum concentrations verapamil norverapamil determined means hplc t2js methoxyverapamil used internal standard the limit quantitation rig ml compounds the interassay coefficient variation verapamil rig ml n norverapamil rig ml n serum erythromycin concentrations determined means hplc 14 roxithromycin used internal standard the limit quantitation pg ml the interassay coefficient variation erythromycin pg ml n pharmacokinetic calculations the pharmacokinetits drugs characterized appropriate peak concentration serum c concentration peak time tmax elimination half life tl area serum concentration time curve time zero hours auc o 24 the elimination rate constant k determined means linear regression analysis log linear phase serum drug concentration time curve the ty2 value calculated tl ln2 k the auc o 24 calculated use trapezoidal rule the observed simvastatin simvastatin acid values rig ml higher regarded rig ml calculation auc values used calculation ty value the auc o 24 erythromycin verapamil norverapamil refers time hours ingestion simvastatin hours fourth dose pretreatment statistical analysis the data expressed mean value sd case tmax median range tables mean value k se fig statistical analysis results except tmax value performed means one way anova tukey test post hoc comparisons the pharmacokinetic variables log transformed statistical analysis group variances unequal the wilcoxon signed rank test used analysis value differences regarded statistically significant p	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
72	Erythromycin coadministration increases plasma atorvastatin concentrations.	The effect of erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, was investigated in 12 healthy volunteers. Each subject received a single 10 mg dose of atorvastatin on two separate occasions, separated by 2 weeks. Erythromycin (500 mg qid) was given from 7 days before through 4 days after the second atorvastatin dose. Atorvastatin concentrations were determined by an enzyme inhibition assay, which measured both atorvastatin and active metabolites. When erythromycin was coadministered with atorvastatin, mean Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) increased by 37.7% and 32.5%, respectively. Mean terminal half-life was similar following each atorvastatin dose. Possible mechanisms for this interaction include erythromycin inhibition of first-pass conversion of atorvastatin to inactive metabolites and erythromycin inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated intestinal or biliary secretion.	methods this study was conducted at the parke-davis commu- nity research clinic, ann arbor, michigan, in from the departments of pharmacokinetics, dynamics, and metabolism (mr. siedlik, dr. olson, dr. yang) and clinical pharmacology (dr. stern), parke-davis pharmaceutical research division, warner-lambert com- pany, ann arbor, michigan. dr. yang is currently with amgen, thousand oaks, ca. submitted for publication january 20, 1998;

73	Exposure of atorvastatin is unchanged but lactone and acid metabolites are increased several-fold in patients with atorvastatin-induced myopathy.	The most serious side effect from statin treatment is myopathy, which may proceed to rhabdomyolysis. This is the first study to investigate whether the pharmacokinetics of either atorvastatin or its metabolites, or both, is altered in patients with atorvastatin-related myopathy compared with healthy controls. A 24-hour pharmacokinetic investigation was performed in 14 patients with atorvastatin-related myopathy. Relevant polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 (encoding organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1), MDR1/ABCB1 (encoding P-glycoprotein), and CYP3A5 (encoding cytochrome P450 3A5) were determined. Data from 15 healthy volunteers were used as controls. No statistically significant difference in systemic exposure of atorvastatin was observed between the 2 groups. However, patients with atorvastatin-related myopathy had 2.4-fold and 3.1-fold higher systemic exposures of the metabolites atorvastatin lactone (P<.01) and p-hydroxyatorvastatin (P<.01), respectively, compared with controls. There were no differences in frequencies of SLCO1B1, MDR1, and CYP3A5 polymorphisms between the 2 groups. This study disclosed a distinct difference in the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin metabolites between patients with atorvastatin-related myopathy and healthy control subjects. These results are of importance in the further search for the mechanism of statin-induced myopathy.	methods subjects patients older years recruited lipid clinic national hospital norway referred

74	Fluoxetine impairs the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of propafenone enantiomers in healthy Chinese volunteers.	To determine the effect of 20 mg/day fluoxetine on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone enantiomers and CYP2D6 activity by phenotyping with dextromethorphan. Nine healthy Chinese volunteers (seven men and two women) were included in a two-phase study. Dextromethorphan (20 mg) was given before and after subjects took 20 mg/day fluoxetine for 10 days, and the dextromethorphan metabolic ratio was calculated to determine CYP2D6 phenotype. Pharmacokinetic studies of propafenone enantiomers after a single oral 400 mg dose before and after pretreatment with 20 mg/day fluoxetine for 10 days were also conducted in these subjects. Reversed-phase HPLC with precolumn derivatization was used to determine enantiomeric concentrations of propafenone in plasma. Mean CYP2D6 dextromethorphan metabolic ratios before and after fluoxetine therapy were 0.028 +/- 0.031 and 0.080 +/- 0.058, respectively (P = .001), indicating that a strong inhibition of CYP2D6 by fluoxetine activity was observed in Chinese subjects. Propafenone metabolism was also impaired significantly after fluoxetine treatment. The elimination half-life, peak concentration, and area under the curve from 0 hours to infinity of two enantiomers after fluoxetine therapy were significantly increased compared with those at baseline (P < .01), whereas oral clearance decreased from 75.01 +/- 17.69 L/h to 49.36 +/- 8.62 L/h for S-propafenone (P = .005) and from 107.62 +/- 33.82 L/h to 70.60 +/- 12.42 L/h for R-propafenone (P = .027). In addition, fluoxetine increased the peak concentration of S-propafenone by 39% and that of R-propafenone by 71% (P < .05). A significant increase of the time to reach peak concentration was observed only in the R-enantiomer and not in the S-enantiomer of propafenone after fluoxetine therapy. There were no differences in the percentage changes of PR and QRS intervals before or after fluoxetine pretreatment at the time observed (P > .05). We conclude that fluoxetine may cause significant inhibition of the CYP2D6 activity as determined by dextromethorphan phenotyping. This inhibition impairs the metabolism of propafenone enantiomers in Chinese subjects. Caution must be exercised when fluoxetine and propafenone are coadministered to avoid potential toxicity.	chemicals and reagentsdextromethorphan hydrobromide tablets (10 mg) were purchased from shanghai huanghe liya pharmaceutical co,shanghai, china. dextromethorphan and its demethylation metabolite dextrorphan were provided by hoffmann-laroche inc (nutley, nj). propafenone hydrochloride tablets (50 mg) were purchased from shanghai xingyi pharmaceuticalco, shanghai, china. propafenone and its two enantiomers s-and r-propafenone were donated by dr h.k. kromer fromdr margarete fischer-bosch-institut fur klinische pharmakologie (stuttgart, germany). fluoxetine hydrochloride (prozac,20 mg) was obtained from eli lilly co ltd, basingstoke, england. all other chemicals and reagents were of analyticalgrade.study subjectsnine healthy chinese volunteers (seven men and two women) were included in the study. the ages ranged from 24to 46 years and their weights ranged 50 to 75 kg. all subjects were healthy as assessed by a physical examination, anecg, and blood biochemistry testing. none of the subjects smoked tobacco or drank alcohol. all subjects abstained fromdrugs for at least 2 weeks before and during the study. subjects were excluded if they were receiving any medicationsknown to induce or inhibit cytochrome p450. pregnant women were excluded by a test for serum human chorionic study protocolthe study was divided into two phases. the first phase examined baseline dextromethorphan metabolicphenotyping and baseline pharmacokinetics of propafenone enantiomers. the second phase was a repeat of the firstphase except that it was conducted after subjects took 20 mg/day fluoxetine for 10 days. there was at least a 2-weekwashout period between the two phases.dextromethorphan metabolic phenotyping. subjects were asked to empty their bladders to collect baseline urinesamples before bedtime. dextromethorphan hydrobromide tablets (20 mg) were taken with 200 ml water. urine wascollected over the next 8 hours. a 15 ml aliquot of urine was stored at -20Â¡c until hplc assay.fluoxetine pretreatment. fluoxetine hydrochloride (20 mg) was given once daily to all subjects for 10 days beforethe second phase of the study. subject reports and capsule counts were used to assess compliance at each visit.pharmacokinetics of propafenone enantiomers. subjects received 400 mg oral racemic propafenonehydrochloride tablets. an intravenous catheter was used to collect blood samples (4 ml each) at 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,10, 12, and 15 hours for the first phase and at 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, and 24 hours for the second phase afterdrug administration. plasma was separated and stored at -20Â¡c until hplc determination.pharmacodynamic end point of propafenone. ecg (cardiofax, model 6511, shanghai kohden med electronicinstrument corp, shanghai, china), heart rate, and blood pressure pertinent to clinical effects of propafenone wereassessed at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 15 hours.analytical procedure. urinary concentrations of dextromethorphan and dextrorphan were measured by a reversedphasehplc method with fluorescence detection developed in our laboratory.6 the limits of detection fordextromethorphan and dextrorphan were 0.023 mg/l and 0.031 mg/l, respectively. the average intraday and interdaycoefficient of variation for dextromethorphan and dextrorphan were all lower than 5%. the average recovery was104.78%. determination of s-and r-propafenone in plasma was accomplished with use of a stereoselective hplc methodestablished in our laboratory.7 the limits of detection of s- and r-propafenone were 10 tg/l and 13 tg/l, respectively.the average intraday and interday coefficients of variation were all below 6%, and average recovery was 102.2%.data analysiscyp2d6 phenotype. the urinary molar metabolic ratio (mr) of the subjects was calculated by use of the equation:equation phenotype was determined on the basis of an mr value according to the method of schmid et al.8 anysubject with an mr >0.3 was classified as a poor metabolizer;

75	Fluvoxamine inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of tolbutamide.	Our objective was to examine the interaction between fluvoxamine and tolbutamide to confirm that fluvoxamine inhibits CYP2C9. The study was carried out as an open, randomized, crossover design with 14 healthy participants. In period A, all volunteers took 500 mg of tolbutamide orally. In period B, the volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Each group took either 150 mg or 75 mg of fluvoxamine a day for 5 days (day -3 to day 2). The groups then took 500 mg of tolbutamide as a single dose (day 0). In both periods, blood and urine were sampled at regular intervals. Plasma was analyzed for tolbutamide, and urine was analyzed for tolbutamide and its two metabolites, 4-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide by means of HPLC. During treatment with fluvoxamine, there was a statistically significant decrease in the median of the total clearance of tolbutamide, from 845 mL/h to 688 mL/h, among the volunteers who received 75 mg/d. There was a reduction that reached borderline statistical significance in the group that received 150 mg/d of tolbutamide. The clearance by means of 4-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide was significantly reduced in both groups (ie, from 901 mL/h to 318 mL/h in the group that received 150 mg of tolbutamide per day and from 723 mL/h to 457 mL/h in the group that received 75 mg of tolbutamide per day). Thus there was a tendency toward a more pronounced inhibition of the 4-hydroxylation during treatment with 150 mg/d of fluvoxamine compared with 75 mg/d, but the difference was not statistically significant. Fluvoxamine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 in vivo.	methods the study carried open randomized crossover design the participants volunteers participants men median age years range years the subjects known heart liver kidney disease according clinical examination clinical chemical hematologic screening electrocardiogram no participants consumed alcohol drugs regular basis time study the volunteers consented participate study basis oral written information the study approved regional ethics committee danish national board health study procedure the study divided two periods in period a volunteers took mg tolbutamide tolbutamide dak nycomed denmark roskilde denmark single oral dose in period b volunteers randomly assigned two fluvoxamine groups one group took mg d fluvoxamine fevarin 100 mg tablets solvay duphar bv weesp the netherlands days single oral dose mg clinical pharmacology therapeutics volume number madsen et al fig mean plasma concentrations tolbutamide among two different groups participants single oral dose mg tolbutamide period a period b concomitant intake mg d open triangles mg d open circles fluvoxamine asterisk calculated samples analytical error one sample double asterisks calculated samples individuals stopped taking fluvoxamine hours side effects coefficients total variation ng ml ng ml respectively pharmacokinetics the following pharmacokinetic parameters calculated period a period b intake fluvoxamine total tolbutamide tb clearance cltb calculated follows cltb dose auc auc area plasma concentration time curve calculated means trapezoidal rule extrapolation last measurable concentration infinity complete absorption tolbutamide intestine assumed 24 tolbutamide half life t1 2 calculated follows t1 2 ln2 terminal log linear slope determination means least squares regression analysis essentially whole dose recovered metabolic products single primary pathway dose excreted unchanged tolbutamide 24 for drug metabolized single pathway clearance parent drug body equal metabolic clearance plus renal clearance unchanged drug thus clearance tolbutamide cltb composed following cltb cl ohtb ctb clr clres cl ohtb ctb clearance hydroxylation clr renal clearance clres residual clearance cl ohtb cbt calculated follows cl ohtb cbt ohtb ctb 0 32 auctb 0 32 period a cl ohtb cbt ohtb ctb 0 72 auctb 0 72 period b ohtb 4 methylhydroxytolbutamide ctb carboxytolbutamide urine hours respectively auctb 0 32 auctb 072 corresponding aucs tolbutamide the equations based assumption rate metabolite formation equals rate appearance urine collection urine complete clr tb 0 32 auctb 0 32 period a clr tb 0 72 auctb 0 72 period b tb 0 32 recovery tolbutamide tb 0 72 recovery tolbutamide hours the residual clearance tolbutamide calculated third equation clres cltb cl ohtb ctb clr statistics all pharmacokinetic parameters reported median range in groups paired median differences confidence inter madsen et al clinical pharmacology therapeutics january table i total partial clearances tolbutamide single oral doses mg tolbutamide period a treatment mg d mg d fluvoxamine period b plasma conc fluvox nmol l period b dose mg median mg median mg vs mg median difference ci mg median difference ci mg median difference ci all mg mg median difference ci total clearance ml h clearance ohtb ctb ml h renal clearance ml h period a period b period a vs period b period a period b period a vs period b period b conc concentration fluvox fluvoxamine ohtb hydroxytolbutamide ctb carboxytolbutamide t1 2 elimination half life vs versus ci confidence interval the renal clearance calculated period a tolbutamide could detected individuals completed hours period b vals compared period a period b in periods unpaired median differences confidence intervals compared groups for types comparisons confidence interval median differences including zero considered statistically significant the influence fluvoxamine plasma concentration change total clearance clearance means hydroxylation examined spearman s rank correlation analysis thus p value two tailed correlation coefficient less considered statistically significant the statistical analysis carried use medstat program package version astra group albertslund denmark	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
76	Griseofulvin and fluvoxamine interactions with the metabolism of theophylline.	Theophylline is predominantly metabolized by cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2). A possible interaction between griseofulvin and theophylline was reported to our laboratory, which led us to form the hypothesis that griseofulvin induces the metabolism of theophylline. One purpose of this study was to investigate this hypothesis. The study was carried out as a randomized crossover study of 12 healthy volunteers. In period A of the study, each volunteer received a single dose of 300 mg theophylline ethylenediamine orally. In period B, the subjects took fluvoxamine, 50 mg for 1 day and 100 mg for 6 days, and on day 4, the subjects ingested 300 mg theophylline ethylenediamine. Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, and period B was included as a positive control. In period C, the subjects took 500 mg griseofulvin for 9 days; on day 8 the subjects again ingested 300 mg theophylline ethylenediamine. Theophylline and its metabolites (1-methyluric acid [IMU], 3-methylxanthine [3MX], and 1,3-dimethyluric acid [13DMU]) in plasma and urine were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. During fluvoxamine intake, the median of the total clearance of theophylline decreased from 80 ml/min to 24 ml/min, and the half-life increased from 6.6 to 22 h. The partial formation clearances of the metabolites decreased from 17 to 1.7 ml/min, from 8.9 to 0.9 ml/min, and from 21 to 6.8 ml/min for 1MU, 3MX, and 13DMU, respectively. The results confirm that assessment of theophylline metabolism indeed serves as a biomarker for CYP1A2. During griseofulvin ingestion, the median of the total and partial clearances of theophylline were 84 ml/min, 22 ml/min (1MU), 9.4 ml/min (3MX), and 25 ml/min (13DMU). The half-life decreased significantly from 6.6 to 5.7 h. The increase in partial formation clearances of 1MU and 13DMU, but not of 3MX, were statistically significant. The increase in the total clearance reached only borderline significance. In four subjects a marked induction was seen for all pharmacokinetic parameters, suggesting that the susceptibility to induction is more pronounced in some subjects. This susceptibility could theoretically be explained by a polymorphism in the inducibility of the gene coding for the CYP1A2 enzyme.	materials and methods the study carried open randomized crossover study volunteers men median age years range years all nonsmokers known heart liver kidney diseases according clinical investigation clinical chemical hematological screening ecg test they consuming alcohol drugs regular basis time study the volunteers consented participate study basis written verbal information study approved regional ethics committee counties vejle funen danish national board health study procedure the volunteers randomized three groups all three groups went three testing periods separated weeks washout in three periods volunteers abstained ingesting methylxanthine containing beverages foods medication days study last blood sample drawn in period a blood sample drawn intake tablet mg theophylline ethylenediamine teofylamin nycomed dak copenhagen denmark containing mg theophylline thereafter blood samples drawn h urine collected h in period b volunteers received tablet mg fluvoxamine solvay duphar bv weesp netherlands day following days received mg fluvoxamine day on day blood sample drawn intake mg theophylline ethylenediamine thereafter blood samples drawn h urine collected h in period c volunteers received mg griseofulvin lamoryl l vens kemiske fabrik copenhagen denmark days on day blood sample drawn intake mg theophylline ethylenediamine thereafter blood samples drawn h urine collected h chemicals reagents theophylline beta hydroxy ethyltheophylline internal standard purchased sigma st louis mo u s a 1 methyluric acid methylxanthine 1 3 dimethyluric acid purchased fluka ag buchs switzerland all chemicals high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade obtained either merck darmstadt germany sigma water purified osmosis distillation analytical methods plasma urine analyzed theophylline metabolites hplc method described detail elsewhere for theophylline three metabolites limits detection mol l plasma mol l urine the intraassay interassay coefficients variation respectively accuracy within plasma urine pharmacokinetic analysis for theophylline following pharmacokinetic parameters calculated three periods the total theophylline clearance calculated equation cl clearance auc13dmx total area plasma concentration time curve calculated trapezoidal rule extrapolation last measurable concentration infinity complete absorption theophylline intestine assumed the partial theophylline clearances calculated equations numerator amount metabolite recovered urine h auc13dmx 0 48 h corresponding auc theophylline eqs based assumption rate metabolite formation equals rate appearance urine the volume distribution vd calculated equation all pharmacokinetic parameters reported medians ranges the median difference confidence interval calculated period a without intake drugs period b concomitant intake fluvoxamine period a without intake drugs period c concomitant intake griseofulvin a confidence interval median difference include zero considered statistically significant the statistical analysis carried medstat program package version astra group albertslund denmark	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
77	Identification of a single time-point for plasma lansoprazole measurement that adequately reflects area under the concentration-time curve.	The objective of this study was to identify a single time-point for plasma lansoprazole measurement that adequately reflects area under the plasma lansoprazole concentration-time curve (AUC) after administration of lansoprazole alone or together with coadministration with CYP mediators. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study design in 3 phases was conducted at intervals of 2 weeks. Eighteen healthy Japanese volunteers, comprising 3 CYP2C19 genotype groups, took a single oral 60-mg dose of lansoprazole after three 6-day pretreatments, that is, clarithromycin 800 mg/d, fluvoxamine 50 mg/d, and placebo. Blood samplings (10 mL each) for determination of lansoprazole were taken up to 24 hours after the administration of lansoprazole. Correlation between plasma lansoprazole concentrations at various time points and AUC0-24 were analyzed. Although there were significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of lansoprazole during clarithromycin and placebo among CYP2C19 genotypes, the differences were not found during fluvoxamine. The plasma concentrations 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after administration (C3, C4, C6, and C8, respectively) were highly correlated with AUC0-24 in coadministration with placebo, clarithromycin, and fluvoxamine (r>0.8, P<0.001). In particular, C6 showed a correlation coefficient of 0.940, 0.992, and 0.953 in coadministration with placebo, clarithromycin, and fluvoxamine, respectively, and was the most appropriate for estimating AUC0-24. The present study demonstrates that AUC of lansoprazole can be estimated by using a single time-point at C6. This method of plasma concentration monitoring at one time-point might be more suitable for AUC estimation than reference to CYP2C19 genotypes, particularly in coadministration of CYP mediators.	methods study design eighteen healthy japanese volunteers men women h pylori negative enrolled study their mean age years mean body weight kg most subjects study participated previous studies 12 13 the ethics committee hirosaki university school medicine approved study protocol written informed consent obtained participant examinations the mutated alleles cyp2c19 cyp2c19 3 3 cyp2c19 2 2 identi ed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism methods de morais et al 14 study the cyp2c19 genotype analyses revealed di erent patterns follows these divided groups homozygous ems n heterozygous ems n pms n a randomized double blind placebo controlled crossover study design phases conducted intervals weeks clarithromycin mg capsule containing equivalent tablets clarith taisho pharmaceutical co ltd tokyo japan uvoxamine mg capsule containing equivalent tablet luvox fujisawa pharmaceutical co ltd osaka japan matched placebo given orally twice day am pm days six volunteers within group allocated di erent drug sequences placebo clarithromycin uvoxamine uvoxamine placebo clarithromycin clarithromycin uvoxamine placebo on day took single oral 60 mg dose lansoprazole takepron takeda pharmaceutical co ltd osaka japan mg dose clarithromycin mg dose uvoxamine placebo overnight fasting am no medications taken study periods no meal allowed hours dosing pm the use alcohol tea co ee cola forbidden test days blood samplings blood sampling ml determination lansoprazole taken heparinized tubes hours administration lansoprazole plasma separated immediately kept 301c analysis assay plasma concentrations lansoprazole quanti ed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc method developed laboratory 15 in brief alkalization ml naoh mol l ml plasma extracted ml diethyl etherdichloromethane vol vol the organic phase evaporated dryness 601c samples dissolved mobile phase phosphate bu er mol l ph acetonitrile methanol vol vol injected onto c18 str ods ii hplc analytical column column ii mm id particle size shinwa chemical industry kyoto japan connected shimadzu class vp shimadzu corporation kyoto japan hplc system the ow rate ml min wavelength set nm the limit quanti cation ng ml lansoprazole intraday interday coe cient variability less lansoprazole respectively lowest concentration ranges pharmacokinetic data analyses the peak concentration cmax time peak concentration tmax obtained directly original data auc0 calculated using trapezoidal rule the terminal rate constant ke used extrapolation determined regression analysis log linear part concentration time curve subject the elimination half life determined 0 693 ke statistical analyses one way analysis variance fisher exact tests used comparisons among cyp2c19 genotypes clinical pro les age body weight sex the 2 way analysis variance comparison placebo versus either clarithromycin uvoxamine conducted pharmacokinetic parameters although analyzed statistical correction correlation di erences using bonferroni lansoprazole concentrations various time points auc0 tested using spearman rank test a p value less regarded signi cant spss 12 0j windows spss japan inc tokyo used statistical analyses predicted auc0 using linear regression model compared observed auc0 calculating mean squared error mse precision using following equation 16 p mse n i 1 pe 2 n precision assessments compared calculating dmse calculated using following equations 16 p dmse n i 1 pe2 c3 pe2 c6 n r lippincott williams wilkins ther drug monit volume number june plasma lansoprazole measurement table pharmacokinetic parameters lansoprazole during control clarithromycin treatment fluvoxamine treatment homozygous ems heterozygous ems pms cyp2c19 pharmacokinetic parameters treatments homozygous ems n heterozygous ems n pms n cmax ng ml tmax h elimination half life h auc0 24 ng ml h with placebo with clarithromycin with uvoxamine with placebo with clarithromycin with uvoxamine with placebo with clarithromycin with uvoxamine with placebo with clarithromycin with uvoxamine data shown mean sd p 0 05 p 0 01 compared placebo prediction error pe predicted acu observed acu the con dence interval ci calculated dmse dmse regarded precise higher ci exceed	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
78	Imipramine-cimetidine interaction: impairment of clearance and enhanced absolute bioavailability.	Six healthy volunteers each received imipramine on four occasions in random sequence, i.v. (12.5 mg) and p.o. (50 mg) in a drug-free state and i.v. and p.o. while taking cimetidine 300 mg every 6 hr. After i.v. doses, elimination half-life of imipramine was increased during cimetidine treatment (22.1 vs. 15.5 hr, P less than .02) as a result of decreased total metabolic clearance (623 vs. 1048 ml/min, P less than .05) with no change in volume of distribution (17.2 vs. 19.8 liters/kg) or plasma protein binding (unbound percent, 17.7 vs. 16.5%). After single p.o. imipramine doses, peak imipramine blood levels achieved were greater during cimetidine therapy (34.4 vs. 19.3 ng/ml, P less than .05) and area under the time/concentration curve was greatly increased (569 vs. 306 ng/ml X hr, P less than .05). Desipramine, the biologically active metabolite of imipramine, was measurable only after p.o. doses. Desipramine area under the time/concentration curve was increased during cimetidine therapy after p.o. imipramine doses (274 vs. 152 ng/ml X hr, P less than .05), suggesting that desipramine clearance was inhibited as well. Comparison of i.v. and p.o. imipramine doses indicated absolute bioavailability was 40.2% in the control state and increased to 75.3% (P less than .05) during cimetidine treatment. Imipramine, with both impaired total metabolic clearance and enhanced bioavailability, in conjunction with increased accumulation of desipramine, would have marked increases in steady-state plasma concentration of both imipramine and desipramine with concurrent cimetidine therapy during chronic p.o. treatment.	methods subjects medications normal psychiatric body healthy six participated weight

79	In vitro and in vivo evaluations of cytochrome P450 1A2 interactions with duloxetine.	To determine whether duloxetine is a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 enzyme, using in vitro and in vivo studies in humans. Human liver microsomes or cells with expressed CYP enzymes and specific CYP inhibitors were used to identify which CYP enzymes catalyse the initial oxidation steps in the metabolism of duloxetine. The potential of duloxetine to inhibit CYP1A2 activity was determined using incubations with human liver microsomes and phenacetin, the CYP1A2 substrate. The potential for duloxetine to induce CYP1A2 activity was determined using human primary hepatocytes treated with duloxetine for 72 hours. Studies in humans were conducted using fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, and theophylline, a CYP1A2 substrate, as probes. The subjects were healthy men and women aged 18-65 years. Single-dose duloxetine was administered either intravenously as a 10-mg infusion over 30 minutes or orally as a 60-mg dose in the presence or absence of steady-state fluvoxamine (100 mg orally once daily). Single-dose theophylline was given as 30-minute intravenous infusions of aminophylline 250 mg in the presence or absence of steady-state duloxetine (60 mg orally twice daily). Plasma concentrations of duloxetine, its metabolites and theophylline were determined using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods and evaluated using mixed-effects ANOVA. Safety measurements included vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, a physical examination, ECG readings and adverse event reports. The in vitro results indicated that duloxetine is metabolized by CYP1A2; however, duloxetine was predicted not to be an inhibitor or inducer of CYP1A2 in humans. Following oral administration in the presence of fluvoxamine, the duloxetine area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)) and the maximum plasma drug concentration (C(max)) significantly increased by 460% (90% CI 359, 584) and 141% (90% CI 93, 200), respectively. In the presence of fluvoxamine, the oral bioavailability of duloxetine increased from 42.8% to 81.9%. In the presence of duloxetine, the theophylline AUC(infinity) and C(max) increased by only 13% (90% CI 7, 18) and 7% (90% CI 2, 14), respectively. Coadministration of duloxetine with fluvoxamine or theophylline did not result in any clinically important safety concerns, and these combinations were generally well tolerated. Duloxetine is metabolized primarily by CYP1A2; therefore, coadministration of duloxetine with potent CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided. Duloxetine does not seem to be a clinically significant inhibitor or inducer of CYP1A2; therefore, dose adjustment of CYP1A2 substrates may not be necessary when they are coadministered with duloxetine.	methods following incubation mol l duloxetine nadph minutes there rapid formation metabolites in vitro cytochrome p450 cyp enzyme incubations containing expressed cyp1a2 cyp2d6 thus

80	In-vitro and in-vivo evaluation of the drug-drug interaction between fluvoxamine and clozapine.	The drug-drug interaction between fluvoxamine (FLV) and clozapine (CLZ) was evaluated by in-vitro and in-vivo methods. In-vitro studies were conducted using human hepatic microsomal preparations with standard chemical inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) isozyme system. Furafyline, FLV, troleandomycin (TAO) and erythromycin were used as the chemical inhibitors. For the in-vivo study, nine male schizophrenic patients were administered a single dose of CLZ 50 mg on two separate occasions with a 2-week FLV treatment of 50 mg twice a day in between each CLZ dose. Blood samples were obtained over 48 h following CLZ administration. CLZ and its two principle metabolites, clozapine N-oxide (CNO) and desmethylclozapine (DCLZ), were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection for both in-vitro and in-vivo studies. The in-vitro formation of DCLZ was inhibited by furafyline and FLV by 42.0% and 48.5% (P<0.01), respectively. TAO and erythromycin had only modest inhibition effects on DCLZ formation of 18.3% and 21.0% (P = NS), respectively. CNO in-vitro formation was significantly reduced by TAO and erythromycin by 44.5% and 45.0% (P<0.01), respectively. Furafyline and FLV had only modest effects of 19.2% and 8.5% (P = NS), respectively. In schizophrenic patients, FLV resulted in a pronounced increased in CLZ plasma concentrations with the total mean CLZ AUC increased by a factor of 2.58 from 780.8 ng/ml per hour to 2218.0 ng/ml per hour (P<0.001). All patients were sedated during combined FLV and CLZ use. During FLV treatment, CNO and DCLZ AUC both decreased by 18.8% (P = 0.07) and 9.0% (P = NS), respectively. These results indicate that in-vitro evaluations may not always accurately reflect changes in drug-drug interaction observed in-vivo. Careful patient monitoring is recommended during FLV/CLZ co-administration.	materials and methods in-vitro evaluation microsomes were prepared and isolated from pooled human liver tissue using stepwise ultracentrifugation. protein content was deter- mined by using the bio-rad protein assay using bovine albumin as the standard. total cyp content was measured by using diÃerential spectrum of solubilized microsomal protein (omura and sato 1964). clz was a gift from sandoz pharmaceuticals (novartis). dclz, cno, nadp+, glucose-6-phosphate (g6p). g6p dehydrogenase (g6pd), troleandomycin (tao), and erythromycin were purchased from sigma chemical (st louis, mo., usa). furafylline was pur- chased from research biomedicals international (natick, mass., usa). fluvoxamine was obtained from tocris cookson, inc. (st louis. mo., usa). all solvents were hplc grade and were obtained from vwr scienti(cid:222)c products (plain(cid:222)eld, n.j., usa). clz was incubated at 37(cid:176) c for 1 h with human hepatic micro- somes (1 mg/ml) in hepes buÃer (500 mm hepes, 150 mm mgcl2, 1 mm edta, ph 7.6) in the presence of an nadph regen- eration system (1 mm nadp+, 10 mm g6p and 1 iu/ml g6pd). the reaction was initiated by the addition of 25 Âµm clz. the cyp inhibitors furafylline (20 Âµm), (cid:223)uvoxamine (50 Âµm), tao (5 Âµm), and erythromycin (100 Âµm) were preincubated for 3 min prior to the addition of clz. furafylline and (cid:223)uvoxamine are known cyp1a2 inhibitors while tao and erythromycin are p450 3a4 inhibitors. reactions were terminated by the addition of equal vol- umes of acetonitrile and put on ice for 15 min to precipitate the protein. after centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 5 min, the super- natant was (cid:222)ltered (anatop 10) and analyzed by hplc. clz and its two metabolites were assayed by hplc with the identical pro- cedure described in the in-vivo section. in-vivo evaluation subjects nine non-smoking stable schizophrenic patients (mean age 38.0 Â± 12.4 years and weight 59.1 Â± 12.3 kg) gave informed consent to par- ticipated in this study. the study was approved by the facilityÃs instutional review board prior to commencement. each patient met the dsm-iv criteria for schizophrenia, had not previously received clz or flv and had not consumed beverages contain- ing caÃeine, alcohol or grapefruit juice for at least 1 month prior to the study. patients were also not taking any known cyp 1a2 inducers or inhibitors or other routinely prescribed medications. only lorazepam Ãas neededÃ 2 mg every 4Ã6 h was allowed during the study. all patients were evaluated to be physically healthy by physical examination, medical history, and routine hematological, biochemical and urinalysis tests. these patients were not classi(cid:222)ed as refractory schizophrenics by the criteria proposed by kane et al. (1988). prior to the study, these patients were phenotyped with dex- tromethorphan and all subjects were extensive metabolizers of cyp 2d6 (lane et al. 1996). also, prior to the study, these patients were also administered a test dose of caÃeine 200 mg and cyp 1a2 sta- tus was evaluated. caÃeine and metabolite ratios were within val- ues previously reported by other investigators, indicating the absence of any unusual metabolizers of cyp 1a2 in this group of patients (bertilsson et al. 1994). on the (cid:222)rst study day at 8:00 a.m., each patient received a sin- gle clz 50 mg dose (two 25 mg tablets). venous blood samples (5 ml) were collected in heparinized tubes and obtained prior to the dosage administration and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h post-drug. the blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and the separated plasma frozen at [20(cid:176) c until assay. flv 50 mg was administered twice a day to each patient from day 3 to day 16. on day 15, clz 50 mg was given as a sin- gle dose. blood samples were obtained at the same times during the (cid:222)rst study period. clz, dclz, and cno were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with ultraviolet detection. the interassay and intrassay coeÃcients of variation were 8.0Ã14.7% at 50 ng/ml for clz and its metabolites. the lower limits of quanti(cid:222)cation was 1 ng/ml for clz and 2.0 ng/ml for dclz and cno, respectively (lui et al. 1996). all samples were assayed in duplicate. the pharmacokinetic parameters for clz and its metabolites were determined by a model-independent method with non-linear least-square regression analysis (winnonlin). the area under the concentration time curve (auc) up to 48 h was calculated accord- ing to the trapezoidal method and extrapolated to in(cid:222)nity by divid- ing the last concentration measured (cp 48) by the elimination rate constant (kel). oral clearance (cl/f) was determined by dividing oral dose (d) by the auc. the apparent volume of distribution (v/f area) was calculated as the ratio of cl/f to kel and the elim- ination half-life was determined according to ln2 divided by kel. values for maximal concentration (cmax), time for maximal con- centration (tmax), and plasma concentrations 12 and 24 h after clz administration (c12 and c24) were determined by visual inspec- tion of the data in each patient. paired two-tailed studentÃs t-test was used to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of clz and its metabolites before and after the addition flv. statistical signi(cid:222)cance was de(cid:222)ned as p < 0.05. 93	DDI Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	0	2	2
81	Influence of fluoxetine on olanzapine pharmacokinetics.	Conventional antidepressant treatment fails for up to 30% of patients with major depression. When there are concomitant psychotic symptoms, response rates are even worse. Thus, subsequent treatment often includes combinations of antidepressants or augmentation with antipsychotic agents. Atypical antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine cause fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than conventional antipsychotics; for that reason, they are an advantageous augmentation strategy for treatment-resistant and psychotic depression. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between olanzapine and fluoxetine, a popular antidepressant that is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The pharmacokinetics of 3 identical single therapeutic doses of olanzapine (5 mg) were determined in 15 healthy nonsmoking volunteers. The first dose of olanzapine was taken alone, the second given after a single oral dose of fluoxetine (60 mg), and the third given after 8 days of treatment with fluoxetine 60 mg, qd. Olanzapine mean Cmax was slightly higher (by about 18%) and mean CL/F was slightly lower (by about 15%) when olanzapine was coadministered with fluoxetine in single or multiple doses. Olanzapine mean t((1/2)) and median t(max) did not change. Although the pharmacokinetic effects of fluoxetine on olanzapine were statistically significant, the effects were small and are unlikely to modify olanzapine's safety profile. The mechanism of influence is consistent with an inhibition of CYP2D6, which is known to control a minor pathway of olanzapine metabolism.	methods this study is based upon urine collection from healthy volunteers included in four previously published studies [6, 9, 10, 12]. all subjects participating in these studies had given their informed consent prior to inclusion, and they had been considered to be healthy, as assessed by medical history, physical examination, and routine blood chemistry tests. the studies had been approved by the regional ethics committee at the university of umeaÂ . in three of the studies [6, 9, 10], Ã¸uvoxamine (fevarin, enteric- coated Ã¸uvoxamine maleate; solvay duphar, veesp, the nether- lands) was given as a single oral dose of 50 mg at 0800 hours. no food was allowed for the next 8 h, except for a standardized lunch at noon. in all studies, intake of alcohol and food or beverages containing caÂeine or other methylxanthines was not allowed on the study days or on the previous day. the subjects had been drug free for at least 2 weeks prior to the study days. the Â¨rst study [6] included Â¨ve subjects known to be poor metabolizers (pms) of drugs catalyzed by cyp2d6 and Â¨ve known to be pms of drugs catalyzed by cyp2c19, in addition to Â¨ve cyp2d6 and cyp2c19 extensive metabolizers (ems). the cyp2d6 and the cyp2c19 phenotypes were determined using the probe drugs dextromethorphan and mephenytoin, respectively, as described in detail previously [6]. the second study [9] included 12 smokers and 12 non-smokers known to be ems of drugs catalyzed by cyp2d6 and cyp2c19. the third study [10] included 12 non-smoking cyp2d6 and cyp2c19 ems. six of them received Â¨rst Ã¸uvoxamine and some weeks later 200 mg caÂeine (two tablets of 100 mg koÂein aco, aco, helsingborg, sweden) as a single oral dose. the other six received the drugs in reverse order. caÂeine was used as a marker for cyp1a2 activity, as cyp1a2 probably accounts for more than 95% of the primary metabolic steps of caÂeine degradation in the great majority of subjects [13]. the method for the serum analysis of caÂeine is described in detail elsewhere [10, 12]. one of the subjects was excluded due to incomplete urine collection, and 11 subjects from this study [10] were therefore included in the current study. consequently, in total, 12 smokers, Â¨ve cyp2d6 pms, Â¨ve cyp219 pms, and 28 non-smoking cyp2d6 and cyp219 ems (Â¨ve from the Â¨rst study [6], 12 from the second study [9], and 11 from the third study [10]) were included in this part of the current study. the gender distribution, ages, and body weights of the subjects are described in table 1. in the fourth study [12], Ã¸uvoxamine was given in increasing doses for a total of 4 weeks. the doses were 25 mg/day the Â¨rst week, 50 mg/day the second week, 100 mg/day the third week, and 200 mg/day the fourth week. half of the daily dose was ingested at 0800 hours and the other half at 2000 hours. in total, ten non- smoking cyp2c19 ems were included. of these, eight were cyp2d6 ems and two were cyp2d6 pms. the study protocol is described in detail elsewhere [12]. from all subjects [6, 9, 10, 12], blood samples were obtained hourly during the Â¨rst 4Â±8 h after intake of Ã¸uvoxamine and thereafter every other hour until 12 h after drug intake. in the maintenance-treatment the blood sampling was performed on day 7 at each dose level. in the single-dose studies [6, 9, 10], a blood sample was also obtained 24 h after drug intake. serum was separated within 30 min after blood sampling and stored frozen until analysis. the analysis of Ã¸uvoxamine in serum was carried out using a high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) method as described in detail previously [9]. study [12], from all subjects, urine was collected either the Â¨rst 12 h [9, 12] or the Â¨rst 24 h [6, 10] after drug intake, and the volumes were table 1 subject characteristics in 50 healthy volunteers given a single oral dose of 50 mg Ã¸uvoxamine. em extensive metabolizer, pm poor meta- bolizer, cyp cytochrome p450 group number 1 2 3 4 number of subjects smoking status cyp2d6 phenotype

metabolites is in the conjugated form in urine [4], hydrolysis was not considered necessary. the analytical method of the major Ã¸uvoxamine metabolite, 4-carboxy-1-[4-(triÃ¸uoromethyl)-phenyl]-1-butane-o-(2-aminoeth- yl)-oxime, consisted of a solid-phase extraction followed by analysis using hplc. the metabolite was synthesized by syntelec ab, lund, sweden. haloperidol (janssen-cilag, beerse, belgium) was found to be a suitable internal standard and could be safely used in this medication-free population. a two-level factorial experimental design [14] was applied to the solid-phase extraction with two diÂerent types of extraction columns, isolute hcx and isolute ph (international sorbent technology ltd., mid glamorgan, uk), respectively. both columns gave an acceptable yield for the metabolite, but only the isolute ph column gave satisfactory results for the internal standard and was therefore used. this process resulted in a work-up procedure as follows: to 1 ml urine was added 5 ml tris buÂer (50 mm tris hcl, ph 7.5). after addition of the internal standard, ph was adjusted to 7.5. the isolute ph column was conditioned with 1 ml methanol and 1 ml tris buÂer, and the sample was applied onto the column. thereafter, the column was washed with 1 ml wash solution con- sisting of tris buÂer (ph 8.5)/methanol/acetonitrile (90:6.67:3.33 v/ v/v). elution was performed with 2Â«0.75 ml methanol/acetonitrile (1:2 v/v) by force of gravity. after evaporation at 40Â¡c, the samples were redissolved in 300 ll mobile phase, and 50 ll was injected on the hplc. applying the two-level factorial experimental design [14] to the hplc separation resulted in a separation on a 3.9Â«150 mm c8 symmetry column (waters chromatography, milford, mass., usa). the mobile phase consisted of 0.085 m kh2po4 buÂer (ph 4.5)/acetonitrile/methanol (74.3:20:5.7 v/v/v). the ultraviolet detector was set at 254 nm. the limit of quantiÂ¨- cation was 1 lmol/l. when the concentrations measured were lower than 1 lmol/l, an arbitrary concentration of 0.5 lmol/l was used in the calculations. the recoveries of the metabolite and internal standard were 50% and 56%, respectively. at a concentration of 37.8 lmol/l, the intraassay coeÂcient of variation was 4% and the interassay coeÂcient of variation was 6%. the standard curve was linear in the concentration range measured with a correlation coeÂcient of 0.994. the highest concentration measured was 138 lmol/l. the area under the curve (auc) for Ã¸uvoxamine in serum was calculated using the trapezoidal method for the same period of time as the urine was collected. the pharmacokinetic program package kinetica, version 2.0.1 (innaphase sarl, champs-sur-marne, france) was used for the auc calculations. apparent oral clear- ance (cl/f, in which f is the bioavailability) of Ã¸uvoxamine was calculated as dose/auc. the amount of the metabolite excreted in urine (ae) was calculated as the product of the concentration measured in the 655 urine sample and the volume of the sample. the clearance for the formation of the metabolite (clm) was calculated as ae(0Â¨t)/ auc(0Â¨t), in which t was 12 h [9, 12] and 24 h [6, 10], respectively. it was assumed that the rate of appearance of the metabolite in the urine was equal to the rate of its formation. student's t-test was used for intergroup comparisons of age and body weight. for comparisons of pharmacokinetic data, analysis of covariance was employed with body weight and age as covariates. body weight was introduced as a covariate because it is a major determinant for the pharmacokinetic variability after intake of a single dose of Ã¸uvoxamine [9]. age was introduced because there was, in addition, a statistically signiÂ¨cant diÂerence between two of the groups (table 1). we have previously found that auc for Ã¸uvoxamine is normally distributed. as we now found that that the clearances of Ã¸uvoxamine were log-normally distributed, as expected, cl/f and clm were log-transformed before inclusion in the statistical analyses. for comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters at diÂerent maintenance dose levels, two-way analysis of variance was used. pearson's correlation test was used for the study of correlation between variables. all calculations were carried out using the systat program package, version 5.2.1. (systat inc., evanston, ill., usa). p values of less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically signiÂ¨cant.	DDI Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	0	2	2
82	Influence of OATP1B1 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in Koreans.	This study was carried out to determine whether polymorphisms of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) have an effect on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in Koreans. Among 200 subjects genotyped for OATP1B1 c.388A>G, and c.521T>C, 30 subjects were selected for the rosuvastatin pharmacokinetic study. The area under the concentration-time curve for 0 to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) of rosuvastatin for group 1 (*1a/*1a, *1a/*1b, *1b/*1b), group 2 (*1a/*15, *1b/*15), and group 3 (*15/*15) were 111+/-49.3, 126+/-45.2, and 191+/-31.0 ng h/ml, respectively, with significant differences among the three groups (P=0.0429) and between *15/*15 and the other groups (P=0.0181). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) also showed a significant difference between *15/*15 and the other groups (P=0.0181). There were no significant differences in rosuvastatin-lactone pharmacokinetics among the three groups. The pharmacokinetic exposure of rosuvastatin was higher in the OATP1B1*15/*15 subjects than the others, suggesting a potential association between the OATP1B1 genetic polymorphisms and altered rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in Korean populations.	methods genetic analysis this study approved institutional review board yonsei university medical center seoul korea a total unrelated healthy

83	Influence of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms on the drug-drug interaction between darunavir/ritonavir and pravastatin.	The authors investigated whether SLCO1B1 polymorphisms contribute to variability in pravastatin pharmacokinetics when pravastatin is administered alone versus with darunavir/ritonavir. HIV-negative healthy participants were prospectively enrolled on the basis of SLCO1B1 diplotype: group 1 (*1A/*1A, n = 9); group 2 (*1A/*1B, n = 10; or *1B/*1B, n = 2); and group 3 (*1A/*15, n = 1; *1B/*15, n = 5; or *1B/*17, n = 1). Participants received pravastatin (40 mg) daily on days 1 through 4, washout on days 5 through 11, darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily on days 12 through 18, with pravastatin 40 mg added back on days 15 through 18. Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted on day 4 (pravastatin alone) and day 18 (pravastatin + darunavir/ritonavir). Pravastatin area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(tau)) was 21% higher during administration with darunavir/ritonavir compared with pravastatin alone; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = .11). Group 3 variants had 96% higher pravastatin AUC(tau) on day 4 and 113% higher pravastatin AUC(tau) on day 18 compared with group 1. The relative change in pravastatin pharmacokinetics was largest in group 3 but did not differ significantly between diplotype groups. In sum, the influence of SLCO1B1*15 and *17 haplotypes on pravastatin pharmacokinetics was maintained in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir. Because OATP1B1 inhibition would be expected to be greater in carriers of normal or high-functioning SLCO1B1 haplotypes, these findings suggest that darunavir/ritonavir is not a potent inhibitor of OATP1B1-mediated pravastatin transport in vivo.	participants the study conducted healthy hiv 1 hiv 2 seronegative men women years age the study approved colorado multiple institutional review board

84	Inhibition by paroxetine of desipramine metabolism in extensive but not in poor metabolizers of sparteine.	Nine extensive metabolizers (EMs) and eight poor metabolizers (PMs) of sparteine took a single oral dose of 100 mg of desipramine HCI before and while taking paroxetine 20 mg per day. Before paroxetine, the median of the total desipramine clearance was 7 times higher in EMs than in PMs (102 and 15 l.h-1 respectively). This confirms that desipramine is extensively metabolized via the sparteine/debrisoquine oxidation polymorphism i.e. by CYP2D6. During paroxetine, the median clearances were 22 l.h-1 and 18 l.h-1 in EMs and PMs respectively. The 5-fold decrease in clearance in EMs when desipramine was co-administered with paroxetine confirms that paroxetine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6. The lack of effect on clearance in PMs shows that paroxetine is a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6, which is absent from the livers of PMs. Before paroxetine, the median of desipramine clearance via 2-hydroxylation was 40-times higher in EMs than in PMs (56 and 1.4 l.h-1 respectively), but during paroxetine, it was only 2-times higher (6 and 2.9 l.h-1 respectively). The increase in this clearance in PMs suggests that paroxetine is an inducer of the alternative, unidentified P450(s) which catalyze(s) the formation of 2-OH-desipramine in this phenotype. Before paroxetine, the median amounts of 2-OH-desipramine glucuronide recovered in urine were 69% and 68% of the total recovery of 2-OH-desipramine in urine in EMs and PMs respectively. During paroxetine, the corresponding values were 77% and 84%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	methods study population we selected ems pms sparteine database approximately healthy danish subjects

85	Inhibition of CYP2D6 activity by bupropion.	The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of bupropion on cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) activity. Twenty-one subjects completed this repeated-measures study in which dextromethorphan (30-mg oral dose) was administered to smokers at baseline and after 17 days of treatment with either bupropion sustained-release (150 mg twice daily) or matching placebo. Subjects quit smoking 3 days before the second dextromethorphan administration. To assess CYP2D6 activity, urinary dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolic ratios were calculated after an 8-hour urine collection. Thirteen subjects received bupropion, and 8 received placebo. In those receiving active medication, the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratio increased significantly at the second assessment relative to the first (0.012 +/- 0.012 vs. 0.418 +/- 0.302; P < 0.0004). No such change was observed in those randomized to placebo (0.009 +/- 0.010 vs. 0.017 +/- 0.015; P = NS). At baseline, all subjects were phenotypically extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (metabolic ratio <0.3); after treatment, 6 of 13 subjects receiving bupropion, but none of those receiving placebo, had metabolic ratios consistent with poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. Bupropion is therefore a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, and care should be exercised when initiating or discontinuing bupropion use in patients taking drugs metabolized by CYP2D6.	materials and methods subjects the subjects in this study were a subset of those enrolled in a larger study examining the effect of bupropion sustained- release with or without stress reduction counseling on physiological response to mental stress tasks during nicotine withdrawal. subjects participating in the main study were asked if they would be interested in concurrently enrolling in this add-on investigation assessing the effect of bupropion on cyp2d6 activity. the university of minnesota institutional review board approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from subjects agreeing to participate. 226 journal of clinical psychopharmacology  volume 25, number 3, june 2005 copyright ' lippincott williams & wilkins. unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. journal of clinical psychopharmacology  volume 25, number 3, june 2005 bupropion inhibits cyp2d6 activity of subjects was 40 (range 21Ã64) years; 76% identified themselves as white, and 48% were women. none of the subjects reported regular use of medications known to significantly affect cyp2d6 activity, although 1 subject reported occasional use of diphenhydramine-containing products.15 this product, however, was not used during the 24-hour period preceding each laboratory visit. two subjects reported taking medications that could potentially affect cyp2d6 metabolism and therefore alter bupropion concen- trations (one reported use of hormone replacement therapy and another oral contraceptives).16 all subjects were pheno- typically extensive metabolizers at baseline as determined by a dm/dx ratio of <0.3. among those taking bupropion, dm/dx ratio in- creased significantly at the second assessment relative to the first (0.012 Â± 0.012 vs. 0.418 Â± 0.302; p < 0.0004) (fig. 1). no such change was observed in those random- ized to placebo (0.009 Â± 0.010 vs. 0.017 Â± 0.015; p = ns). of those receiving bupropion, 46% (6/13) were phenotyp- ically poor metabolizers after treatment. discussion this study demonstrates that bupropion administration can result in a potent inhibition of cyp2d6. the extent of inhibition observed is similar to that of other antidepressants, such as paroxetine and fluoxetine, known to be significant inhibitors of this drug-metabolizing enzyme. for example, in a series of 2 studies, alfaro et al17,18 found that 8 days of paroxetine administration resulted in an increase in dm/dx ratio from 0.028 to 1.085 in one study and from 0.017 to 0.601 in the other. eight days of fluoxetine administration (using a loading dose strategy to approximate steady-state plasma concentrations) in these 2 studies resulted in an increase in metabolic ratio from 0.020 to 0.364 and from 0.017 to 0.313, respectively.17,18 the increase in dm/dx all subjects at the time of enrollment were between the ages of 18 and 65 years and smoked at least 15 cigarettes per day. exclusion criteria included subjects with a history of eating disorder or seizure disorder, those with a current unstable or serious medical condition, and those with a current psychiatric diagnosis as determined by the primary care evaluation of mental disorders.12 subjects were asked to limit intake of alcoholic beverages during the study and to abstain entirely for 3 days before each laboratory session. study design/procedures in this 2-phase repeated-measures study, cyp2d6 activity was assessed in each subject before and after 17 days of treatment with either bupropion sustained-release or placebo. after the initial assessment of cyp2d6 activity, subjects were randomized to bupropion with and without stress reduction counseling or matching placebo. bupropion therapy was initiated at a dose of 150 mg given once daily for 3 days followed by 150 mg given twice daily for 14 days. subjects were blinded regarding drug assignment. as per the protocol of the main study, subjects were instructed to quit smoking 14 days after starting drug therapy, and only those who had successfully quit for the 3 days before the second laboratory session returned for this visit. only sub- jects who completed both laboratory sessions are included in this analysis. study medication (bupropion or placebo) was taken through the morning of the second dm challenge. to assess cyp2d6 activity, subjects were adminis- 1 tered 30 mg of dextromethorphan hydrobromide (robitussin maximum strength, whitehall-robins healthcare, madison, nj) and asked to collect urine for the subsequent 8-hour period. urinary concentrations of dm and dx were quantified, and a dm/dx ratio was calculated. urinary concentrations of dm and dx were quantified using high- performance liquid chromatography with fluorescent detec- tion. sample preparation was carried out by solid-phase extraction with c18 columns according to the methods of ducharme et al.13 chromatographic separation was accom- plished using a waters 2695xe chromatographic system with a waters (milford, ma) 2475 fluorescence detector as described by straka et al.14 for subjects with dm concen- trations lower than the lower limit of quantitation (0.1 mg/ ml), the dm/dx ratios were calculated using a dm con- centration of 0.1 mg/ml. of the 42 samples analyzed (2 per subject), 4 had dm concentration <0.1 mg/ml. a paired student t test was used to assess statistical signif- icance of the differences between dm/dx ratios within each treatment group.

86	Inhibition of cytochrome P4502D6 activity with paroxetine normalizes the ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype as measured by nortriptyline pharmacokinetics and the debrisoquin test.	"The ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype of the cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme has been considered a relevant cause of nonresponse to antidepressant drug therapy. Prescribing high doses of antidepressants to such patients leads to high concentrations of potentially toxic metabolites and an increased risk for adverse reactions. Normalization of the metabolic status of ultrarapid metabolizers by inhibition of CYP2D6 activity could offer a clinically acceptable method to successfully treat such patients with antidepressants. Five ultrarapid metabolizers with a CYP2D6 gene duplication or triplication were treated with 25 mg nortriptyline twice a day for 3 consecutive weeks, alone during the first week and concomitantly with the CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine 10 mg or 20 mg twice a day, respectively, during the second and third weeks. After the third week, nortriptyline was discontinued and the subjects were treated with paroxetine 20 mg twice a day during the fourth study week. At the end of each study week, the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of nortriptyline or paroxetine were determined within the dose interval. In addition, the CYP2D6 phenotype was determined by debrisoquin (INN, debrisoquine) test at baseline and at the end of each study phase. Treatment-related adverse events were recorded during drug administration and for 1 week thereafter. All 5 subjects had very low (subtherapeutic) nortriptyline concentrations after 7 days' treatment with nortriptyline only. Addition of paroxetine 10 mg twice a day to the nortriptyline regimen resulted in a change in all individuals to the ""normal"" extensive debrisoquine metabolizer phenotype, and therapeutic plasma nortriptyline concentrations were achieved in 4 of 5 subjects after a 3 times mean increase in nortriptyline trough concentration (P =.0011). Doubling the paroxetine dose caused a 15 times mean increase in paroxetine trough concentration (P <.001), indicating strong inhibition by paroxetine of its own metabolism. The high paroxetine concentrations in 2 subjects caused them to have the poor debrisoquine metabolizer phenotype and resulted in a further increase in plasma nortriptyline trough concentration (P =.0099). A strong correlation (rank correlation coefficient [r(s)] = 0.89; P <.0001) was observed between paroxetine and nortriptyline trough concentrations. Paroxetine also significantly decreased the fluctuation of nortriptyline concentrations within the dose interval. One subject discontinued the study after the second study week because of adverse effects; otherwise, the study drugs were well tolerated. Paroxetine, with a daily dosage from 20 to 40 mg, is an effective tool in normalizing the metabolic status of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers."	methods subjects and ethics. five ultrarapid metabolizers of debrisoquin with a debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin metabolic ratio <0.20 were recruited into the study. according to the genotype analysis, 4 of the 5 subjects had 3 functional cyp2d6 genes and 1 had 4 active genes. the demographic characteristics of the subjects are given in table i. the subjects were recruited from clinical pharmacology & therapeutics volume 70, number 4 laine et al 329 a population of healthy volunteers previously pheno- typed and genotyped for cyp2d6 activity at the hud- dinge university hospital. the debrisoquin hydroxyla- tion phenotype had been determined after ingestion of 10 mg of debrisoquin (debrisoquine; cambridge labo- ratories, newcastle, united kingdom) and collection of urine for 8 hours thereafter.1 the urinary ratio of debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin had been measured by hplc and used as the measure of cyp2d6 activ- ity.19 to reveal the number of functional cyp2d6 alle- les, genotyping for the defective cyp2d6*3 and *4 alleles had been carried out by a polymerase chain reac- tion method with specific primers20 and ecori restric- tion fragment length polymorphism to determine which subjects carried duplicated or multiduplicated cyp2d6*2 genes or the cyp2d6*5 allele.6,21 the good health of the subjects was ascertained by medical history, physical examination, and results from standard clinical chemical tests, including a pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram, before the study. all sub- jects were nonsmokers who did not use concomitant medications, including oral contraceptives, except for subject 1 who took 0.1 mg thyroxine daily for hypothy- roidism. alcohol intake and use of caffeine-containing beverages were not allowed during the study. the sub- jects received both verbal and written information on the study, and written informed consent was obtained. the study protocol was approved by the ethics com- mittee at the huddinge university hospital. protocol. the 5 ultrarapid debrisoquine hydroxyla- tors received 25 mg of nortriptyline (sensaval; lund- beck, copenhagen, denmark) twice daily at 8 am and 8 pm from day 1 to day 7 (week 1), and the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of nortriptyline and 10- hydroxynortriptyline were assessed after the morning dose on day 7. from day 8 to day 14, paroxetine 10 mg twice daily was added to the nortriptyline regimen (week 2), and the pharmacokinetic results of nortripty- line, 10-hydroxynortriptyline, and paroxetine were determined on day 14. on days 15 to 21 the subjects received 20 mg of paroxetine twice daily in addition to the nortriptyline regimen (week 3), and the pharmaco- kinetic results were evaluated on day 21 as on day 14. on day 22 administration of nortriptyline was stopped and the subjects received 20 mg of paroxetine only from day 22 to day 28 (week 4). the pharmacokinetic parameters of paroxetine were determined on day 28 to investigate the effect of nortriptyline on the steady-state concentrations of paroxetine. in addition, the debriso- quin hydroxylation test was carried out at baseline (day 0) and after the evening drug regimens on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 to get a measure of the effect of different treatments at steady state on cyp2d6 activity. subject 1 experienced treatment-related adverse effects and did not receive the higher paroxetine dose, thus complet- ing only the first two treatment weeks. on days 7, 14, 21, and 28, the study drugs were administered by the study personnel; otherwise, the drugs were self-admin- istered by the subjects, and compliance was monitored by subject journals, tablet counts, and plasma drug con- centrations. venous blood samples (10 ml) for the measurement of plasma nortriptyline, 10-hydroxynortriptyline, and paroxetine concentrations were drawn through a fore- arm cannula before and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after the drug administration on the mornings of days 7, 14, 21, and 28. for the debrisoquin hydroxylation test, sub- jects took the 10-mg debrisoquine dose at 10 pm, and urine was collected for the next 8 hours for the mea- surement of the debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin ratio. all samples were stored at Ã20Â¡c until analyzed. the subjects kept a journal of adverse events from the beginning of the study until 1 week after (poststudy week) the last drug administration on day 28. the recordings of adverse events and drug administration were verified by the responsible physician (k. l.) after each study week. bioanalytic procedures. plasma concentrations of nortriptyline and unconjugated 10-hydroxynortripty- line were determined by hplc with mass spectromet- ric detection according to tybring et al22 with minor modifications. calibration curves were analyzed in the concentration range of 30 to 700 nmol/l for both com- pounds. the limit of quantification was 2 nmol/l. the interday coefficients of variation (cv) for both analytes were <8% at a concentration level of 75 nmol/l and <3% at the 350-nmol/l concentration level. determination of paroxetine levels was performed with hplc and ultraviolet detection. briefly, the inter- nal standard, doxepin, and 0.5 ml of 0.5-mol/l sodium hydroxide were added to 0.5 ml plasma and extracted to 1.5 ml 3% isoamyl alcohol in heptane for 10 min- utes. after centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3000g, the organic phase was transferred to a new test tube con- taining 75 Âµl of 25-mmol/l acetic acid. the samples were extracted for 5 minutes and centrifuged for 5 min- utes at 3000g. the heptane phase was aspirated off completely, and 25 Âµl of the water phase was injected into the hplc system. a phenomenex luna c18 col- umn (100 _ 2 mm) (phenomenex inc, torrance, calif) was used, and the mobile phase consisted of 36% ace- tonitrile in 40-mmol/l potassium phosphate buffer, ph 7.5. the flow rate was 0.3 ml/min, and the compounds were detected with ultraviolet detection at 293 nm at 330 laine et al clinical pharmacology & therapeutics october 2001 table ii. steady-state pharmacokinetics of nortriptyline and 10-hydroxynortriptyline after 1 weekÃs treatment with nortriptyline 25 mg twice daily alone, nortriptyline 25 mg plus paroxetine 10 mg twice daily, or nortriptyline 25 mg _ 2 plus paroxetine 20 mg twice daily parameter nortriptyline 25 mg _ 2 (n = 5) nortriptyline 25 mg _ 2 plus 10 mg _ 2 (n = 5) paroxetine nortriptyline 25 mg _ 2 plus 20 mg _ 2 (n = 4) paroxetine nortriptyline 10-hydroxynortriptyline auc_ (nmol/l Ã¡ h) cmax (nmol/l) cmin (nmol/l) tmax (h) cl/f (l/h/kg) auc_ (nmol/l Ã¡ h) cmax (nmol/l) cmin (nmol/l) tmax (h) auc ratio 971 (276) 99 (24) 62 (18) 4 (4-6) 1650 (979) 3070 (806) 298 (84) 195 (51) 2 (2-4) 3.35 (1.12) 2720 (1120) 264 (107) 187 (77) 6 (4-6) 703 (638) 1820 Â± 709 169 Â± 67 131 Â± 54 2 (2-6) 0.91 (0.80) 4740 (2140) 455 (196) 366 (177) 6 (4-6) 322 (127) 1510 Â± 664 141 Â± 65 120 Â± 49 6 (2-6) 0.38 (0.21) f2,7 36.2* 39.5* 38.8* Ã 36.5* 6.7Â  0.9 1.3 Ã 29.7* auc_, area under the serum concentration-time curve during the dose interval from time zero to 12 hours;

87	Inhibition of triazolam clearance by macrolide antimicrobial agents: in vitro correlates and dynamic consequences.	Macrolide antimicrobial agents may impair hepatic clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P4503A isoforms. Potential interactions of triazolam, a substrate metabolized almost entirely by cytochrome P4503A in humans, with 3 commonly prescribed macrolides were identified using an in vitro metabolic model. The actual interactions, and their pharmacodynamic consequences, were verified in a controlled clinical study. In an in vitro model using human liver microsomes, 250 mumol/L triazolam was incubated with ascending concentrations (0 to 250 mumol/L of troleandomycin, azithromycin, erythromycin, and clarithromycin. In a randomized, double-blind, 5-trial clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study, 12 volunteers received 0.125 mg triazolam orally, together with placebo, azithromycin, erythromycin, or clarithromycin. In a fifth trial they received placebo plus placebo. Mean 50% inhibitory concentrations versus 4-hydroxytriazolam formation in vitro were as follows: 3.3 mumol/L troleandomycin, 27.3 mumol/L erythromycin, 25.2 mumol/L clarithromycin, and greater than 250 mumol/L azithromycin. Apparent oral clearance of triazolam when given with placebo or azithromycin was nearly identical (413 and 416 mL/min), as were peak plasma concentrations (1.25 and 1.32 ng/mL) and elimination half-life (2.7 and 2.6 hours). Apparent oral clearance was significantly reduced (P < .05) during erythromycin and clarithromycin trials (146 and 95 mL/min). Peak plasma concentration was correspondingly increased, and elimination half-life was prolonged. The effects of triazolam on dynamic measures were nearly identical when triazolam was given with placebo or azithromycin, but benzodiazepine agonist effects were enhanced during erythromycin and clarithromycin trials. The in vitro model identifies macrolides that may impair triazolam clearance. Anticipated interactions, and their pharmacodynamic consequences in volunteer subjects, were verified in vivo.	methods in vitro studies samples liver obtained transplant donors known liver disease

88	Introduction of a composite parameter to the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine and its active O-desmethyl metabolite.	Venlafaxine is a structurally novel, nontricyclic compound that is being evaluated for the treatment of various depressive disorders. A randomized three-period crossover study was conducted to obtain pharmacokinetic and dose proportionality data on the drug and its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine. Eighteen healthy young men received single doses of venlafaxine 25, 75, and 150 mg followed by 3 days of administration every 8 hours (q8h). Steady-state elimination half-life was 3 to 4 hours for venlafaxine and 10 hours for O-desmethylvenlafaxine; both were independent of dose. Venlafaxine had a high oral-dose clearance, ranging from 0.58 to 2.63 L/hr/kg across doses with the lowest mean clearance, 0.98 L/hr/kg, at the highest dose. The apparent clearance of O-desmethylvenlafaxine was lower than venlafaxine, ranging from 0.21 to 0.66 L/hr/kg, and the lowest mean clearance, 0.33 L/hr/kg, occurred at the lowest dose. The area under the metabolite curve was two to three times greater than that for venlafaxine. Each compound had linear dose proportionality up to 75 mg q8h. A composite parameter incorporating venlafaxine plus O-desmethylvenlafaxine was introduced (i.e., AUC [area under the curve] + activity factor.AUCm), which extended linearity to 150 mg q8h. In summary, venlafaxine is a high-clearance drug that forms a metabolite with almost equal activity and demonstrates linear dose-proportionality.	methods subjects procedures h n desmethyl hocb ch3 ho

89	Itraconazole alters the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin to a greater extent than either cerivastatin or pravastatin.	3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are metabolized by distinct pathways that may alter the extent of drug-drug interactions. Cerivastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and CYP2C8. Atorvastatin is metabolized solely by CYP3A4, and pravastatin metabolism is not well defined. Coadministration of higher doses of these statins with CYP3A4 inhibitors has the potential for eliciting adverse drug-drug interactions. To determine the comparative effect of itraconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin. In this single-site, randomized, three-way crossover, open-labeled study, healthy subjects (n = 18) received single doses of cerivastatin 0.8 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 40 mg without and with itraconazole 200 mg. Pharmacokinetic parameters [AUC(0-infinity), AUC(0-tn), peak concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (tmax), and half-life (t1/2)] were determined for parent statins and major metabolites. Concomitant cerivastatin/itraconazole treatment produced small elevations in the cerivastatin AUC(0-infinity), Cmax, and t1/2 (27%, 25%, and 19%, respectively; P < .05 versus cerivastatin alone). Itraconazole coadministration produced similar changes in pravastatin pharmacokinetics [AUC elevated 51% (P < .05 versus pravastatin alone), 24% (Cmax), and 23% (t1/2), respectively]. However, itraconazole dramatically increased atorvastatin AUC (150%), Cmax (38%), and t1/2 (30%) (P < .05). The elevation in atorvastatin AUC was significantly greater than that of cerivastatin (P < .005) or pravastatin (P < .005). Itraconazole markedly elevated atorvastatin plasma levels (2.5-fold) after 20 mg dosing, suggesting that concomitant itraconazole/atorvastatin therapy be carefully considered. Itraconazole produced modest elevations in the plasma levels of cerivastatin 0.8 mg or pravastatin 40 mg (1.3-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively), indicating that combination treatment with itraconazole with cerivastatin or pravastatin may be preferable.	methods study design this single center randomized three way crossover open labeled study designed evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters cerivastatin

90	Itraconazole drastically increases plasma concentrations of lovastatin and lovastatin acid.	Lovastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug that can cause myopathy as a rare side effect. Concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., cyclosporine) increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity. Lovastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Because itraconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, we wanted to study a possible interaction between these drugs. In this double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of lovastatin. Plasma concentrations of lovastatin, lovastatin acid, itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole, and creatine kinase were measured up to 24 hours. On average, itraconazole increased the peak concentration (Cmax) of lovastatin and the area under the lovastatin concentration-time curve (AUC) more than twentyfold (p < 0.001). The mean Cmax of the active metabolite, lovastatin acid, was increased 13-fold (range, tenfold to 23-fold; p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) twentyfold (p < 0.001). In one subject plasma creatine kinase was increased tenfold within 24 hours of lovastatin administration during the itraconazole phase but not during the placebo phase. No increase in creatine kinase was observed in the other subjects. Itraconazole greatly increases plasma concentrations of lovastatin and lovastatin acid. Inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism probably explains the increased toxicity of lovastatin caused not only by itraconazole but also by cyclosporine, erythromycin, and other inhibitors of CYP3A4. Their concomitant use with lovastatin and simvastatin should be avoided, or the dose of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors should be reduced accordingly.	methods study design five male seven female volunteers age range years weight range kg table i participated study gave written informed consent the study approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki the subjects ascertained healthy means clinical examination laboratory tests e g blood count glucose serum potassium creatinine alanine amino transferase creatine kinase all subjects nonsmokers none receiving continuous medication except two female subjects using contraceptive steroids table i blood sampling determination drug concentrations on day administration lovastatin forearm vein subject cannulated plastic cannula kept patent obturator blood sampled tubes contained ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid timed blood samples ml collected immediately administration lovastatin hours administration plasma separated within minutes stored c analyzed plasma concentrations lovastatin lovastatin acid quantified hplc 13 a cm x mm internal diameter column packed p rn particle sized shandon hypersil c bds alltech deerfield ill used the detection limit ngiml the coefficient variation lovastatin ml lovastatin acid r ml the standard curves linear ngiml itraconazole metabolites plasma interfere analytical method a randomized double blind crossover study dethe concentrations itraconazole hydroxysign two phases used intervals weeks itraconazole determined hplc 14 15 a the volunteers given either mg itraconcm x mm internal diameter column packed azole sporanox janssen pharma beerse belgium wrn particle sized shandon hypersil c bds placebo orally am days on day used ammonium acetate acetonitrile subject ingested single mg dose lovaused mobile phase the detection limit statin lovacol orion espoo finland license q ml the coefficient variation itra merck co inc ml water am conazole ngiml hydroxyitracon56 neuvonen jalava clinical pharmacology therapeutics july azole rig ml creatine kinase quantified use routine photometric method hospital laboratory pharmacokinetic calculations the pharmacokinetits characterized peak c minimum cmin itraconazole hydroxyitraconazole concentrations plasma concentration peak times tma j elimination half lives areas drug plasma concentration time curves hours auc o 24 the auc o 24 values itraconazole hydroxyitraconazole refer time hours ingestion lovastatin hours last dose itraconazole statistical analysis all data expressed mean values sem data analyzed student test paired values wilcoxon signed rank test differences regarded statistically significant whenp values	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
91	Ketoconazole inhibition of triazolam and alprazolam clearance: differential kinetic and dynamic consequences.	Kinetic and dynamic consequences of metabolic inhibition were evaluated in a study of the interaction of ketoconazole, a P4503A inhibitor, with alprazolam and triazolam, two 3A substrate drugs with different kinetic profiles. In a double-blind, 5-way crossover study, healthy volunteers received (A) ketoconazole placebo plus 1.0 mg alprazolam orally, (B) 200 mg ketoconazole twice a day plus 1.0 mg alprazolam, (C) ketoconazole placebo plus 0.25 mg triazolam orally, (D) 200 mg ketoconazole twice a day plus 0.25 mg triazolam, and (E) 200 mg ketoconazole twice a day plus benzodiazepine placebo. Plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamic parameters were measured after each dose. For trial B versus trial A, alprazolam clearance was reduced (27 versus 86 mL/min; P < .002) and apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) prolonged (59 versus 15 hours; P < .03), whereas peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was only slightly increased (16.1 versus 14.7 ng/mL). The 8-hour pharmacodynamic effect areas for electroencephalographic (EEG) beta activity were increased by a factor of 1.35, and those for digit-symbol substitution test (DSST) decrement were increased by 2.29 for trial B versus trial A. For trial D versus trial C, triazolam clearance was reduced (40 versus 444 mL/min; P < .002), t1/2 was prolonged (18.3 versus 3.0 hours; P < .01), and Cmax was increased (2.6 versus 5.4 ng/mL; P < .001). The 8-hour effect area for EEG was increased by a factor of 2.51, and that for DSST decrement was increased by 4.33. Observed in vivo clearance decrements due to ketoconazole were consistent with those anticipated on the basis of an in vitro model, together with in vivo plasma concentrations of ketoconazole. For triazolam, an intermediate-extraction compound, impaired clearance by ketoconazole has more profound clinical consequences than those for alprazolam, a low extraction compound.	methods design the

92	Kinetic and dynamic interaction study of zolpidem with ketoconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole.	Azole antifungal agents may impair hepatic clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450-3A isoforms. The imidazopyridine hypnotic agent zolpidem is metabolized in humans in part by P450-3A, as well as by a number of other cytochromes. Potential interactions of zolpidem with 3 commonly prescribed azole derivatives were evaluated in a controlled clinical study. In a randomized, double-blind, 5-way, crossover, clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study, 12 volunteers received (A) zolpidem placebo plus azole placebo, (B) 5 mg zolpidem plus azole placebo (C) zolpidem plus ketoconazole, (D) zolpidem plus itraconazole, and (E) zolpidem plus fluconazole. Mean apparent oral clearance of zolpidem when given with placebo was 422 mL/min, and elimination half-life was 1.9 hours. Clearance was significantly reduced to 250 mL/min when zolpidem was given with ketoconazole, and half-life was prolonged to 2.4 hours. Coadministration of zolpidem with itraconazole or fluconazole also reduced clearance (320 and 338 mL/min), but differences compared to the zolpidem plus placebo treatment did not reach significance. Zolpidem-induced benzodiazepine agonist effects (increased electrocardiographic beta activity, digit-symbol substitution test impairment, and delayed recall) during the first 4 hours after dosage were enhanced by ketoconazole but not by itraconazole or fluconazole. Coadministration of zolpidem with ketoconazole impairs zolpidem clearance and enhances its benzodiazepine-like agonist pharmacodynamic effects. Itraconazole and fluconazole had a small influence on zolpidem kinetics and dynamics. The findings are consistent with in vitro studies of differentially impaired zolpidem metabolism by azole derivatives.	methods in vitro studies procedures acquisition storage human liver tissue

To determine whether the pharmacokinetics of the antidepressant citalopram are affected by ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Single-center, double-blind, randomized, three-way crossover trial. Research facility. Eighteen healthy male and female volunteers. Subjects received three treatments with a 14-day washout period: single dose of ketoconazole 200 mg plus placebo, single dose of citalopram 40 mg plus placebo, and single dose of ketoconazole 200 mg plus single dose of citalopram 40 mg. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after each treatment. The pharmacokinetic profile of citalopram administered alone was essentially identical to that when administered with ketoconazole. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite desmethylcitalopram were unaltered by ketoconazole. No changes in pharmacokinetics of citalopram were observed after coadministration of ketoconazole, suggesting that ketoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors may be administered safely with citalopram. Furthermore, no adjustment of citalopram dosage should be necessary in most patients who receive the drug in combination with a CYP3A4 inhibitor.	methods this single center double blind randomized three way crossover study conducted pharmaceutical research associates inc international technical medical consultants inc lenexa kansas study protocol appendixes approved institutional review board subjects healthy male female nonsmoking volunteers years age gave written informed consent they required within ideal body weight relation height frame size determined elbow breadth measurement a negative serum pregnancy test necessary women also required maintain medically accepted method birth control sexually active study subjects never smoked smoked past years sitting pulse rate greater beats minute palpation heart rate greater beats minute recorded electrocardiogram ecg exclusion criteria clinically significant neurologic psychiatric cardiovascular renal hepatic pulmonary metabolic hematologic disease states individuals known hypersensitivity either study drug related agent also excluded taking concomitant drugs including over the counter products except oral contraceptives subjects admitted nonsmoking environment approximately p m days they six overnight stays days they received snack p m days fasted overnight hours receiving dose study drug days identical xanthine free meals provided subjects housed grapefruit grapefruit juice prohibited duration water allowed ad libitum hours dosing time food water consumption restricted hours dosing when meal times coincided blood sampling schedule vital sign monitoring vital signs measured first blood samples drawn meals the following blinded treatments administered randomized order separated days single dose ketoconazole mg plus placebo single dose citalopram mg plus placebo single dose ketoconazole mg plus single dose citalopram mg doses within normal therapeutic range agent safety assessed throughout study monitoring adverse events ecgs laboratory values vital signs blood sampling assay blood drawn treatment hour dose hours dose plasma concentrations citalopram metabolites quantified highperformance liquid chromatograph hplc interfaced triple quadruple mass spectrometer srm mode liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry detection plasma ketoconazole concentrations quantified hplc fluorescence detection the limit quantification study substances ng ml pharmacokinetic analyses area plasma concentration time curve time time corresponding last measurable concentration auc0 t calculated numerical integration using linear trapezoidal rule lack of effect of ketoconazole on citalopram gutierrez abramowitz table pharmacokinetics citalopram mg without ketoconazole without ketoconazole n 17 with ketoconazole n 17 cmax ng ml tmax hrs auc0 t ng hr ml auc0 ng hr ml half life hrs a cl f l hr vz f l ahalf life citalopram calculated using terminal rate constants hours without ketoconazole hours ketoconazole bstatistically significant difference p value 0 041b auc0 t s 0 5 ci ci 1 ti ti 1 n i 1 eq cl f vz f lz eq ci plasma concentration citalopram metabolites ketoconazole corresponding sampling time point ti time corresponding last measurable concentration maximum plasma concentrations cmax time cmax t max determined observation plasma concentrations expressed ng ml the first order rate constant lz describing terminal decline plasma estimated winnonlin version using log linear regression terminal linear phase mean plasma concentration time curves citalopram metabolites ketoconazole estimates half life t1 2 hours calculated using following equation t1 2 lz eq the area plasma concentration time curve time zero infinity calculated using following equation clast auc0 auc0 t lz eq oral clearance cl f f bioavailability d dose calculated following equation d cl f auc0 eq the apparent volume distribution vz f calculated using following equation nominal sampling time points used pharmacokinetic calculations statistical analyses statistical comparison groups respect pharmacokinetic parameters performed analysis variance anova a general linear model containing fixed effects sequence period treatment subjects basis analysis treatment difference estimated tested significance based model all statistical tests two sided significance level	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
94	Lack of effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in healthy subjects.	To examine in vivo the effect of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. This was a randomized, double-blind, two-way crossover, placebo-controlled trial. Healthy male volunteers (n = 14) received ketoconazole 200 mg or placebo twice daily for 7 days, and rosuvastatin 80 mg was coadministered on day 4 of dosing. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin, and active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were measured up to 96 h postdose. Following coadministration with ketoconazole, rosuvastatin geometric least square mean AUC(0,t) and Cmax were unchanged compared with placebo (treatment ratios (90% confidence intervals): 1.016 (0.839, 1.230), 0.954 (0.722, 1.260), respectively). Rosuvastatin accounted for essentially all of the circulating active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and most (> 85%) of the total inhibitors. Ketoconazole did not affect the proportion of circulating active or total inhibitors accounted for by circulating rosuvastatin. Ketoconazole did not produce any change in rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects. The data suggest that neither cytochrome P450 3A4 nor P-gp-mediated transport contributes to the elimination of rosuvastatin.	methods n controlled trial healthy male volunteers received ketoconazole

95	Lack of interaction between citalopram and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam.	To determine the effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram on plasma levels of triazolam, and to determine the effect of a single dose of triazolam on steady-state levels of citalopram and its major metabolites. Open-label, multidose study. Clinical Studies, Ltd., Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Eighteen healthy male and female volunteers. Subjects received triazolam 0.25 mg alone and another 0.25-mg dose after 4 weeks of citalopram 20 mg/day for 1 week, followed by 3 weeks of citalopram 40 mg/day Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after single-dose administration of triazolam alone, after administration of citalopram alone at steady state, and after coadministration of the drugs. The pharmacokinetics of triazolam and its metabolite alpha-hydroxytriazolam were unchanged by citalopram coadministration. Triazolam appeared to be absorbed slightly more quickly during coadministration. Citalopram kinetics were unaffected by coadministration. No pharmacokinetic interaction between the drugs was observed, suggesting that triazolam and other cytochrome P450 3A4 substrates can be coadministered safely with citalopram.	methods subjects eighteen healthy male and female volunteers who satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study after providing written informed consent. subjects were included if they were between 18 and 35 years of age, in good general health, capable of understanding information provided to them about the study, had body weight within the normal range (as defined by the 1983 metropolitan height and weight table), had a sitting pulse of 50 beats/minute or more and heart rate of 50 beats/minute or more as recorded by electro- cardiogram, and were nonsmokers. women of childbearing age were included if they had a negative serum pregnancy test before the start of the study, and if they agreed to continue a medically-accepted contraceptive method during the study. exclusion criteria were known sensitivity to any serotonergic or benzodiazepine drug; presence of acute or chronic ailments; history of organ system dysfunction including cardiac, respiratory, renal, neurologic, or psychiatric disorders; or state of health that might require drug therapy in the month preceding the study. other reasons for exclusion were participation in another clinical study within 30 days of the start of this study, donation of blood within 60 days of the start of the study, history of a syncopal episode within the previous 2 years, head injury with loss of consciousness during the previous 5 years, and history of alcohol or substance abuse within the past 5 years. subjects who had consumed caffeine within 48 hours or alcohol within 72 hours were excluded. study design this was an open-label, multidose study. the institutional review board approved the clinical protocol and informed consent form. the study was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki as adopted by the 18th world medical assembly in 1964 and subsequent amendments (tokyo 1975, venice 1983, hong kong 1989). a single dose of triazolam 0.25 mg was administered on day 1. this is the recommended dose for treating insomnia in healthy patients and was well tolerated in pharmacokinetic studies.20 after a 3-day washout period, citalopram 20 mg once/day was administered on days 4Ã10. the citalopram dosage was increased to 40 mg once/day on days 11Ã32. on day 33, a single dose of triazolam 0.25 mg was coadministered with the daily dose of citalopram 40 mg. subjects were admitted at 7:00 p.m. to nonsmoking housing for an overnight stay on days 0, 1, 31, 32, and 33. they fasted overnight for 10 hours before study drug administration at 8:00 a.m. and blood sampling. water was allowed ad libitum until 2 hours before dosing, after which it was restricted until 4 hours after dosing. identical xanthine-free meals were provided while subjects were housed. vital signs were measured on days 1, 4, 11, 32, and 33 at 0.0 (predose) and 4.0 hours after drug 752 pharmacotherapy volume 20, number 7, 2000 administration, and on days 18 and 25 at 0.0 hour. adverse events were recorded as spontaneously reported by subjects, and subjects were questioned about general well-being each time vital signs were measured. blood sampling blood samples were collected on days 1, 32, and 33 at times 0.0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours (the 24-hour sample on day 32 also served as the 0.0-hour sample on day 33). levels of triazolam and _-hydroxytriazolam were determined from samples taken on days 1 and 33. steady-state levels of citalopram, dct, and ddct were determined from samples taken on days 32 and 33. additional blood samples were taken before citalopram dosing on days 4, 11, 18, 25, 30, and 31 and used to determine trough levels of citalopram and metabolites. bioanalytic assays triazolam and _-hydroxytriazolam were measured in plasma using a validated bioanalytic assay method. previous work demonstrated that analytes of interest could be measured using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (lc/ms/ms) via atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (apci) in the positive ion mode.21 the assay employed for this study used a similar lc/ms/ms technique and attained a limit of quantification of 30 pg/ml for both compounds from a 0.5-ml plasma sample. bioanalytic assays for citalopram and its metabolites were performed by a validated method using lc/ms with an ion trap mass analyzer in the apci mode. the method was capable of quantifying the analytes at a 0.5-ng/ml level from 0.5 ml of plasma. plasma samples were extracted by organic-phase extraction with n-butylchloride as the organic solvent. the standard curve concentrations for citalopram and metabolites were 0.50Ã500 ng/ml. standard curves were linear with correlation coefficients better than or equal to 0.99. recoveries, measured at concentrations of 3.0 ng/ml and 75.0 ng/ml, ranged from 95.6Ã96.1% for citalopram, from 95.7Ã96.4% for dct, and from 85.0Ã94.6% for ddct. intraday and interday reproducibility for citalopram and its metabolites were approximately 10% or less. pharmacokinetic analyses noncompartmental methods were used to determine the values of key pharmacokinetic parameters. calculations were performed using the nonlinear regression program winnonlin (scientific consulting inc., mountain view, ca). peak plasma concentrations (cmax) and time to cmax (tmax) of triazolam, citalopram, and their respective metabolites were determined observationally. for triazolam, the area under the curve up to the time of last measurable concentration (auc0Ãt) was calculated by linear trapezoidal rule. the elimination rate constant (_z) was calculated by performing a regression analysis on the terminal linear phase of semilogarithmic plots of individual plasma citalopram, triazolam and respective metabolite concentration-time data. elimination half-lives were determined as follows: t1/2 = 0.693/_z. the area under the curve from time zero to time infinity (auc0ÃÂ°) was determined as follows: auc0ÃÂ° = auc0Ãtlast + clast/_z, where clast is the last measurable concentration and tlast is the corresponding time point. since citalopram levels were determined after multiple-dose administration at steady state, auc0ÃÂ° values for citalopram and its metabolites were not determined. instead, values for the (_ = 24 hrs)were determined. auc 0Ã_ elimination half-life values for citalopram and its metabolites were not derived. oral clearance values for triazolam and citalopram were calculated as cl/f = dose/auc0ÃÂ° and cl/f = dose/auc0Ã_, respectively, with f as oral bioavailability. volume of distribution values (vdss/f) were calculated as follows: vdss/f = mrtÂ¥cl/f, where mrt is mean residence time. statistical analysis for calculated pharmacokinetic parameters, paired comparisons of triazolam alone and in combination with citalopram, and of citalopram alone and in combination with triazolam were performed by wilcoxon rank sum test. methods subjects eighteen healthy male and

96	Lack of interaction between nefazodone and cimetidine: a steady state pharmacokinetic study in humans.	The steady-state pharmacokinetic interaction between nefazodone and cimetidine was evaluated in a three-period crossover study consisting of three treatments of 1 week duration with a 1 week washout between treatments. The 18 healthy, male study subjects received: nefazodone hydrochloride 200 mg twice daily (every 12 h) for 6 days; cimetidine 300 mg four times daily for 6 days; and 200 mg nefazodone hydrochloride twice daily + 300 mg cimetidine four times daily for 6 days. On day 7 of each treatment, only the morning dose was administered. Serial blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis after drug administration on day 7 of each treatment; blood samples for trough levels (Cmin) to assess attainment of steady state, were also collected just prior to the morning doses on days 2-7 of each study period. Plasma samples were assayed for cimetidine, and nefazodone and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone and m-chlorophenylpiperazine by specific, validated h.p.l.c. methods. Statistical analyses of Cmin data indicated that, regardless of treatment, steady state was achieved for cimetidine by day 2 and for nefazodone and its metabolites by day 3 of multiple dosing, and that there were no significant differences in Cmin levels between treatments. When nefazodone and cimetidine were co-administered for 1 week, no change in steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for cimetidine, nefazodone or hydroxynefazodone was observed compared with each drug dosed alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	methods study design drug analysis this open label randomized multiple dose three period complete crossover study consisting three treatments week

97	Lack of interaction between ramipril and simvastatin.	Twenty two healthy males participated in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over study to investigate the influence of simvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of ramipril and its active metabolite (ramiprilat), and on the ACE-inhibiting effect of ramiprilat. During two study periods, each of 7 days, subjects received daily either simvastatin 20 mg at 19.00 h or placebo; ramipril (5 mg) was given on Day 5 of each of the periods. Plasma concentrations of ramipril and ramiprilat and ACE-activity were measured in sequential blood specimens, and ramipril and ramiprilat concentrations were measured in urine. Blood and urine collections for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment were made up to 72 h after the dose of ramipril. The mean AUC of ramipril for ramipril+placebo (R+P) and ramipril+simvastatin (R+S) was 22.2 and 21.3 ng.h.ml-1, respectively; for ramiprilat the corresponding figures were 61.3 and 57.6 ng.h.ml-1. The urinary excretion of ramipril+metabolites for (R+P) and (R+S) was 25.2 and 24.1% of dose. The maximum percentage inhibition of ACE-activity for (R+P) was 94.6%, and for (R+S) it was 94.1%. It is concluded that concomitant administration of simvastatin and ramipril has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or ACE-inhibition of the latter drug and its metabolites.	subjects methods a power calculation used determine number subjects required for power true percentage difference sample size required based area ramiprilat plasma concentration time curve previous studies after obtained written informed consent ethics committee approval healthy non smoking male volunteers mean age range mean weight range kg participated randomised placebo controlled double blind cross over study the study conducted according principles good clinical practice simvastatin mg placebo given h days single dose ramipril mg h fifth day a wash out period days allowed ramipril placebo ramipril simvastatin treatments plasma concentrations ramipril ramiprilat urine concentrations ramipril metabolites ace activity plasma measured blood samples taken following times measurement ramipril ramiprilat medication min h ramipril ii measurement ace activity medication h urine measurement ramipril ramprilat collected following fractions h medication bo the confidence intervals calculated mean square error anova treatment subject period effects logarithmic transformation variables analytical methods plasma ramipril ramiprilat determinations done radio immunoassay ace activity done measure extent ace inhibition ramiprilat determined radiochemical method urine concentrations ramipril metabolites measured incubation glucuronidase using gas chromatographic assay biometric methods the following pharmacokinetic variables calculated plasma ramipril ramiprilat concentrations maximum concentration cmax time c a x tma area concentration time data pairs auc 0 6 h ramipril auc 0 24 h ramiprilat cma x tma read directly data auc calculated linear trapezoidal rule urinary excretion ramipril ramiprilat metabolites ramipril glucuronide ramiprilat glucuronide diketopiperazine diketopiperazine acid calculated percentage administered dose correction different molecular weights the following variables calculated plasma aceactivity time data pairs auc 0 24 h maximum inhibition ace activity time maximum inhibition auc calculated mentioned the maximum inhibition calculated inhibition max max ace 0 h ace t ace 0 h 100 ace t ace activity sampling time the time maximum inhibition obtained directly sampling time corresponding inhibition max point estimates confidence intervals calculated mean ratios ramipril simvastatin ramipril place	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
98	Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction of mipomersen sodium (ISIS 301012), a 2'-O-methoxyethyl modified antisense oligonucleotide targeting apolipoprotein B-100 messenger RNA, with simvastatin and ezetimibe.	Mipomersen sodium (ISIS 301012) is a 20-mer phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide that is complementary to human apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) messenger RNA and subsequently reduces translation of ApoB-100 protein, the major apolipoprotein of very low-density lipoprotein, intermediate-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Mipomersen sodium is currently being studied in phase II/III clinical studies to determine its clinical utility as add-on therapy to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or other lipid-lowering agents in subjects with hypercholesterolaemia. The aim of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic interactions of mipomersen sodium with simvastatin and ezetimibe. Another aim was to evaluate the ability of mipomersen sodium to inhibit major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes in vitro. In a phase I clinical study, ten healthy subjects per cohort received a single oral dose of simvastatin 40 mg or ezetimibe 10 mg followed by four 2-hour intravenous doses of mipomersen sodium 200 mg over an 8-day period, with simvastatin 40 mg or ezetimibe 10 mg being administered again with the last dose of mipomersen sodium. Mipomersen sodium pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed following the first dose (mipomersen sodium alone) and the last dose (mipomersen sodium in combination with simvastatin or ezetimibe). Plasma samples for measurement of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, and free and total ezetimibe concentrations were collected at various timepoints following their first and last oral dosing. A comparative pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to determine if there were any effects resulting from coadministration of mipomersen sodium with these lipid-lowering drugs. In addition to the clinical pharmacokinetic analysis, the ability of mipomersen sodium to inhibit the major CYP isoform enzymes (namely CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) was evaluated in cryo-preserved human hepatocytes in vitro. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 24 hours (AUC(24)), maximum plasma concentration and apparent elimination half-life values of mipomersen sodium were similar when administered alone and in combination with oral simvastatin or oral ezetimibe. The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric least squares means ratios (%Reference) of the mipomersen sodium AUC(24) values were 93.6, 107 when administered together with simvastatin, and 92.4, 111 when administered with ezetimibe. Therefore, there were no large deviations outside the default no-effect boundaries (80-125%) for total exposure (the AUC) of mipomersen sodium in combination with either simvastatin or ezetimibe. Similarly, large deviations outside the default no-effect boundaries were not observed for simvastatin, simvastatin acid, or free and total ezetimibe exposure in combination with mipomersen sodium. In cryo-preserved human hepatocytes, mipomersen sodium exhibited no cytotoxicity. Significant cell uptake was demonstrated by analysing cell-associated concentrations of mipomersen sodium. All evaluated enzyme activities had <10% inhibition at tested concentrations up to 800 microg/mL (approximately 100 micromol/L) of mipomersen sodium, and dose-dependent inhibition was not observed. Therefore, mipomersen sodium is not considered an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities. These data provide evidence that mipomersen sodium exhibits no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions with the disposition and clearance of simvastatin or ezetimibe, and vice versa. Moreover, mipomersen sodium does not inhibit any of the major CYP enzymes that were evaluated. Taken together, the results from this study support the use of mipomersen sodium in combination with oral lipid-lowering agents.	methods subjects subjects mild hypercholesterolaemia subjects primary

99	Lipid lowering therapy with fluvastatin and pravastatin in patients with HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy: comparison of efficacy and interaction with indinavir.	Lipoprotein disorders in HIV-positive patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are becoming a major concern in HIV treatment, since there is growing evidence for an association between HAART-induced hyperlipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk. Yet relatively few data are available on the possible interactions of HAART and treatment with statins. In this prospective study, 25 HIV-positive, treatment-experienced patients (five female, 20 male, all Caucasian) were treated with either fluvastatin or pravastatin. Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and serum triglycerides were determined at regular intervals, as well as therapeutic drug monitoring to assess possible drug interactions. In 13 pravastatin-treated patients, a decrease in total cholesterol levels (from 7.12 mmol/l to 6.29 mmol/l) after 12 weeks of therapy was seen. In 12 patients treated with fluvastatin, a permanent reduction of total cholesterol (from 6.46 mmol/l to 5.31 mmol/l) after 12 weeks was observed. The reduction of LDL levels was 30.2% in the fluvastatin group and 14.4% in the pravastatin group. In eight patients receiving an indinavir-containing HAART, indinavir plasma levels were not significantly influenced. No effect on triglycerides or HDL was observed. Fluvastatin and pravastatin are efficient in lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels in HIV-positive patients receiving HAART. Furthermore, no influence on indinavir plasma levels could be observed. Therefore, both compounds seem to be a viable treatment option in HAART-induced hypercholesterolemia.	patientsin this prospective, non-randomized, open-label study, 25 patientsreceiving antiretroviral therapy were treated with fluvastatin (n =12) or pravastatin (n = 13). patient characteristics are outlined intable 1; details of their antiretroviral therapy are shown in table 2.inclusion criteria were: documented hiv infection, ongoing antiretroviraltherapy for longer than 2 years, and hypercholesterolemiarefractory to changes in lifestyle and diet. exclusion criteriawere use of comedication interfering with the cyp-450 systemas well as a lack of therapy adherence.data collectionlevels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (ldl) andhigh density lipoprotein (hdl) and serum triglycerides were determinedin a fasting state,with regular measurements during the72-week observation period. subsequent analysis of cholesteroland triglycerides was performed by enzymatic and colorimetricassays (chodpap [cholesterol oxidase-phenol aminophenazoneperoxidase reaction] and gpo-pap [glycerol-phosphate oxidasephenol amonophenazone reaction]. hdl was measured enzymatically(direct hdl) and ldl was calculated by the friedewaldformula. in addition, non-specific parameters for potentialtoxic effects were determined (liver enzymes, lactate-dehydrogenase[ldh], creatine-kinase [ck], creatinine,blood urea nitrogen [bun]). normal values were:total cholesterol 3.4-5.7mmol/l, ldl cholesterolÂ² 3.9 mmol/l, hdl cholesterol > 0.9 mmol/l, triglycerides0.8-19 mmol/l.determination of plasma indinavir levelsplasma indinavir (idv) levels were determined asdescribed by langmann et al. [14]. a high performanceliquid chromatographic (hplc) method forthe determination of idv in human plasma wasused. quantitative recovery following liquid-liquidextraction with diethyl ether from 500 _l of humanplasma was achieved.the hplc system consisted of a beckman systemgold (beckman instruments, munich, germany),a 126 solvent pump module, and a 502 e autoinjector.a 167 programmable detector moduleand beckman system gold software were employedfor peak determination and peak identification/integration, respectively.the sample preparation was performed with500 _l of patient plasma, an equal volume of carbonatebuffer (0.1m sodium carbonate-sodium bicarbonateph 9.4) and 100 _l of an internal standard(a-86093) added to a 15 ml glass tube. thesample was vortexed for 10 sec and extracted twicewith 3 ml diethyl ether for 5 min, followed by centrifugationat 3,000 g (4 Â¡c). subsequently, the organiclayers were transferred into a glass centrifugetube and evaporated to dryness with a gentlestream of nitrogen at 37 Â¡c.the residue was reconstituted in 300 _l 67mmpotassium-dihydrogen-phosphate-methanol (1:1v/v) and washed for 5 min with 1.5 ml n-hexane.theaqueous layer was transferred to autosampler vialswith glass micro inserts for hplc analysis.a 100 _laliquot was injected into the chromatograph.the assay was performed with a linear gradient starting at67mm potassium-dihydrogen-phosphate-acetonitrile 65:35 (v/v)to 40:60 (v/v) as a mobile phase, a phenomenex c18 column anduv detection at 258 nm. linear standard curves were obtainedfor concentrations ranging from 75 to 20,000 ng/ml for idv.thecalculated intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were below6%.the detection limit of idv in plasma was determined at2 ng/ml and the lower limit of quantitation was reached at a concentrationof 75 ng/ml for idv [13].a determination of idv plasma concentrations in dosagesof idv 1.6 g/d (n = 2 samples) in combination with low-dose ritonavirand of idv 2.4 g/d (n = 6) samples was performed 2Ã4 hafter oral ingestion. the range of idv plasma levels wasexpressed as mean Â± standard deviation (sd).statisticsall data were presented as mean Â± sd. studentÃs t-test was usedfor statistical analysis. values were considered statistically significantif p < 0.05.role of the funding sourcethe sponsors of the study had no role in study design, data collection,data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

100	Lopinavir/ritonavir induces the hepatic activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2 but inhibits the hepatic and intestinal activity of CYP3A as measured by a phenotyping drug cocktail in healthy volunteers.	The effect of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) administration on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity was quantified using a phenotyping biomarker cocktail. Changes in CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP1A2, N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT-2), and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities were evaluated using warfarin (WARF) + vitamin K, omeprazole (OMP), intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) midazolam (MDZ), and caffeine (CAF). : Open-label, multiple-dose, pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers. Subjects (n = 14) simultaneously received PO WARF 10 mg, vitamin K 10 mg, OMP 40 mg, CAF 2 mg/kg, and IV MDZ 0.025 mg/kg on days (D) 1 and 14, and PO MDZ 5 mg on D2 and D15. LPV/r (400/100 mg twice daily) was administered on D4-17. CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activities were quantified by S-WARF AUC0-inf and OMP/5-hydroxy OMP ratio, respectively. CYP1A2, NAT-2, and XO activities were quantified by urinary CAF metabolite ratios. Hepatic and intestinal + hepatic CYP3A activities were quantified by IV (CL) and PO (CL/F) MDZ clearance, respectively. After LPV/r therapy, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2 activity increased by 29%, 100%, and 43% (P = 0.001, 0.046, and 0.001), respectively. No changes were seen in NAT-2 or XO activity. Hepatic and intestinal + hepatic CYP3A activity decreased by 77% (P < 0.001) and 92% (P = 0.001), respectively. LPV/r therapy results in modest induction of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 and potent induction of CYP2C19 activity. Increasing doses of concomitant medications metabolized by these enzymes may be necessary. LPV/r inhibited intestinal CYP3A to a greater extent than hepatic CYP3A activity. Doses of concomitant CYP3A substrates should be reduced when combined with LPV/r, although intravenously administered compounds may require less of a relative dose reduction than orally administered compounds.	methods subjects sixteen volunteers were screened and assessed to be healthy by physical examination, medical history, and laboratory evaluations. subjects weighed at least 50 kg, were 18 to 45 years of age, and were hiv-1 seronegative. subjects were excluded if they had signiÃcant medical conditions or laboratory abnormalities; had a history of allergy to any study medication; were 20% more or less than their ideal body weight; used any prescription or over-the- counter medications, vitamin, or herbal supplements on a regular basis; had a history of alcohol or drug abuse; were unable to abstain from alcohol or grapefruit juice for the duration of the study; used tobacco products within 2 months before the Ãrst study visit; or had a baseline international normalized ratio (inr) greater than 1.2. sexually active women were required to have a negative urine pregnancy test and to use a barrier form of birth control for the duration of the study. the university of north carolina (unc) institutional review board approved the study protocol, and all subjects provided written informed consent before any study procedures. materials lpv/r (kaletra) soft gelatin capsules were obtained from abbott laboratories (abbott park, il). caf 2-mg/ml po solution (formulated from caf citrate puriÃed powder, mallinckrodt, phillipsburg, nj), warf 10-mg tablets (war- farin, dupont pharmaceuticals, newark, de), vitamin k 10-mg tablets (mephyton, merck and co, inc, whitehouse station, nj), omp 40-mg capsules (prilosec, astrazeneca, wilming- ton, de), mdz 5-mg tablets (mdz, bedford laboratories, bedford, oh), and mdz 1-mg/ml iv solution (mdz 2-ml vials, bedford laboratories, bedford, oh) were dispensed from the unc hospitals investigational drug service pharmacy. vitamin k was administered to prevent the phar- macologic effect of warf without altering the pharmacoki- netics of the warf stereoisomers.16 * 2006 lippincott williams & wilkins study design this was an open-label, pharmacokinetic (pk) study consisting of two 48-hour inpatient visits at the verne s. caviness general clinical research center (gcrc) at unc hospitals and 2 follow-up outpatient visits (days 4 and 17). the duration of the study was 17 days. as previous investigations have not noted signiÃcant menstrual cycle effects on phenotyping biomarker data, this study did not control for menstrual cycle.17y22 on days 1 and 14, all subjects were admitted to the gcrc. after a peripheral iv line was placed for blood collection, patients emptied their bladder and were dosed with the phenotyping medications. on the Ãrst day of each pk visit (days 1 and 14), each subject received simultaneous administration of 4 po medications (caf 2 mg/kg, warf 10 mg, vitamin k 10 mg, and omp 40 mg) and 1 iv medication (mdz 0.025 mg/kg). caf metabolites were continuously collected in urine over 12 hours. blood samples for warf were collected just before warf administration and then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours afterward. blood samples for omp and 5-hydroxy metabolite (5-oh omp) were collected 2 hours after omp administration. blood samples for iv mdz for the Ãrst pk visit were collected just before mdz administration and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours afterward. during inpatient visits, standardized research meals were served consisting of approximately 15% protein, 30% fat, and 55% carbohydrate for a total daily intake of 2000 to 2500 calories. meals were Ãnished within 30 minutes and given at least 2 hours after administration of

an outpatient visit to obtain a 72-hour warf blood sample. at day 4 outpatient visit, subjects took their Ãrst dose of lpv/r soft gelatin capsules, administered orally at the usual clinical dose of 400 lpv/100 mg rtv twice daily. subjects were advised to take lpv/r with food. medication adherence for this 10-day period was assessed by pill counts performed by the study coordinator on day 15 and dosing administration cards completed daily by the study subject. these data were reviewed by the study coordinator before initiation of the second inpatient study visit (day 14). subjects with less than 95% adherence were removed from the study. in addition, to further assess adherence, a blood sample for lpv and rtv concentrations was drawn upon gcrc admission, before administration of the phenotyping medications. lpv/r was continued through day 17. during the second pk visit (pk 2, days 14y17), phenotyping procedures were performed in the same manner as during days 1 to 4 (pk 1).

101	Low daily 10-mg and 20-mg doses of fluvoxamine inhibit the metabolism of both caffeine (cytochrome P4501A2) and omeprazole (cytochrome P4502C19).	Fluvoxamine is metabolized by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and the smoking-inducible CYP1A2. Therapeutic doses of fluvoxamine inhibit both CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. In this study we used extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) of debrisoquin (INN, debrisoquine) (CYP2D6) and two probes, caffeine (CYP1A2) and omeprazole (CYP2C19), to investigate whether nontherapeutic doses of fluvoxamine inhibit CYP1A2 but possibly not CYP2C19. Single oral doses of 100 mg caffeine and 20 mg omeprazole were given separately to 5 EMs and 5 PMs of debrisoquin to assess the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, respectively. Initially, a single oral dose of fluvoxamine (25 mg to PMs and 50 mg to EMs) was given, followed by 1 week of daily administration of 25 mg x 2 to EMs and 25 mg x 1 to PMs. Caffeine (day 6) and omeprazole (day 7) were again administered at the steady state of fluvoxamine. Later the study protocol was repeated with a lower dose of fluvoxamine, 10 mg x 2 to EMs and 10 mg x 1 to PMs for 1 week. Concentrations of fluvoxamine, caffeine, omeprazole, and their metabolites were analyzed by HPLC methods in plasma and urine. The kinetics of fluvoxamine were not significantly different in EMs and PMs after a single oral dose of the drug. At the higher but not the lower steady-state dose of fluvoxamine, a significantly lower clearance in PMs compared with EMs was observed (geometric mean, 0.86 versus 1.4 L/h per kilogram; P <.05). At steady state, the 25 mg x 1 or x 2 fluvoxamine dose caused a pronounced inhibition of about 75% to 80% for both CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, whereas the inhibition after the lower 10 mg x 1 or x 2 dose was about 40% to 50%. The area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] of caffeine increased 5-fold (P <.001) after the higher dose of fluvoxamine and 2-fold (P <.05) after the lower dose. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 8 hours [AUC(0-8)] ratio of 5-hydroxyomeprazole/omeprazole decreased 3.4-fold (P <.001) and 2.4-fold (P <.001), respectively. One EM subject had a very low oral clearance of fluvoxamine after both single and multiple dosing of the drug. This subject might have a deficient transporter protein in the gut, leading to an increased absorption of fluvoxamine. No convincing evidence was found that CYP2D6 is an important enzyme for the disposition of fluvoxamine. Other factors seem to be more important. A nontherapeutic oral daily dose of fluvoxamine is sufficient to provide a marked inhibition of both caffeine (CYP1A2) and omeprazole (CYP2C19) metabolism. It was not possible to separate the inhibitory effects of fluvoxamine on these enzymes, even after such a low daily dose such as 10 mg x 1 or x 2 of fluvoxamine.	subjects and methodssubjects. twelve healthy white subjects, 6 men and6 women, aged 22 to 45 years (mean, 30 years) and weighing 56 to 94 kg (mean, 81 kg for the men and 69kg for the women), participated in this study, whichincluded 7 ems and 5 pms of debrisoquin. the debrisoquinmetabolic ratio (mr) ranged from 0.57 to 2.2 inems and from 35 to 260 in pms. genotyping ofcyp2d6 and cyp2c19 was performed in 1 subject(subject no. 12) by the methods of heim and meyer44(cyp2d6*3 and *4) and de morais et al45(cyp2c19*2). all subjects were healthy as assessed bymedical history, physical examination, urine drugscreen, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, virologictesting (hepatitis b, hepatitis c, human immunodeficiencyvirus), and routine laboratory analyses (liver andkidney function and hematologic testing). all were nonsmokersand had been drug-free for at least 1 weekbefore the study. the consumption of alcohol was prohibited48 hours before and throughout the study. nocaffeine-containing products (coffee, tea, cola, chocolate)were allowed within 36 hours before and 24 hoursafter caffeine intake. the use of oral contraceptives wasallowed, and 1 woman took a combination of 0.15mg desogestrel and 20 _g ethinyl estradiol (inn,ethinylestradiol).the human ethics committee at huddinge universityhospital, karolinska institutet, approved the studyprotocol. written informed consent was obtained fromall subjects. they were free to withdraw from the studyat any time.study design. the study was performed in 3 periods(fig 1). the first day of period 1, a single oral dose of100 mg caffeine (tablet koffein; recip ab, stockholm,sweden) and the second day a single dose of 20 mgomeprazole (capsule losec; astra hÂssle ab, mÂlndal,sweden) were given to all subjects. on the third daythe 5 ems received 50 mg (25 mg _ 2) and 5 pmsreceived 25 mg fluvoxamine as a single oral dose. fluvoxaminewas administered as 25-mg capsules manufacturedby the pharmacy at huddinge university hospital.for this purpose the 50 mg tablet (fevarin; medaab, stockholm, sweden) was used. all drugs weregiven at 8 am after an overnight fast for at least 8 hours.during the second study period, the volunteers tookmultiple doses of fluvoxamine, 25 mg daily given at 8am to 5 pms and 25 mg twice a day given at 8 am and8 pm to 5 ems for 7 days, to reach steady-state concentrationsof fluvoxamine (fig 1). the volunteers tooktheir medications at home. side effects were documentedby the volunteers and were asked for at the trialunit during the study days. on days 6 and 7, singledoses of caffeine (100 mg) and omeprazole (20 mg)were given according to the same protocol as duringperiod 1. period 2 was performed 2 to 16 days afterperiod 1.because the fluvoxamine dose given during period 2strongly inhibited both cyp1a2 and cyp2c19 (seeresults), a lower dose of fluvoxamine was given duringperiod 3. this was performed 3.4 to 5.8 monthsafter period 2. the third period was identical to the secondperiod, but a lower dose of fluvoxamine was given(ie, 10 mg daily to pms and 20 mg [10 mg _ 2] to ems)(fig 1). again, 10- mg fluvoxamine capsules were manufacturedby the hospital pharmacy as described. twoem subjects (subjects no. 1 and no. 4) were not ableto participate in period 3 because of travel abroad and,therefore, were replaced by 2 new ems (subjects no.12 and no. 13). they also followed the protocol inperiod 1 before entering period 3.blood and urine sampling. standardized lunch anddinner were served during days 1 to 3 in period 1 anddays 6 to 7 in periods 2 and 3, with the first meal servedat 3 hours after drug intake. venous blood samples (10ml) were drawn at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours aftercaffeine administration and at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8hours after omeprazole intake. blood samples for fluvoxamine analysis during period 1 were obtained at thesame time points as for caffeine but extended with samplesat 32, 48, and 72 hours after fluvoxamine intake,with the last two samples only in pms. the blood samplingprotocol for caffeine and omeprazole on days 6and 7 during the multiple doses of fluvoxamine in studyperiods 2 and 3 was identical to that of period 1. theblood samples for fluvoxamine analysis during periods2 and 3 were drawn at trough level (just before themorning dose) on days 6 and 7, followed by samples at2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after dose intake on day 7.after centrifugation, plasma was separated and storedfrozen at Ã20Â¡c until analysis. all urine was collectedfor 24 hours after caffeine intake. the urine volume wasmeasured and the ph was adjusted to 3.5 with concentratedhydrochloric acid. aliquots of 10 ml were storedat Ã20Â¡c until analyzed.drug analysis. quantification of fluvoxamine inplasma was performed with hplc and ultravioletdetection as described by carrillo et al.1 the limit ofquantification was 2.5 nmol/l. the intra-assay andinterassay coefficients of variation (cv) were 5.2% and4.7%, respectively, at a fluvoxamine concentration of10 nmol/l and 4.6% and 3.1%, respectively, at a fluvoxamineconcentration of 50 nmol/l.the plasma concentrations of omeprazole and its twometabolites 5-hydroxyomeprazole and omeprazole sulfonewere quantified with the use of a reversed-phasehplc method similar to that described by tybring etal.36 the intra-assay and interassay cv values foromeprazole and the two metabolites were lower than6.6% in the range from 100 to 1000 nmol/l. the limitsof quantification were 25 nmol/l for omeprazoleand the sulfone and 50 nmol/l for 5-hydroxyomeprazole.the 5-hydroxyomeprazole/omeprazole area underthe concentration-time curve [auc(0-8 h)] ratio wasused as a measure of the cyp2c19 activity.36 similarly,the omeprazole sulfone/omeprazole auc(0-8 h) ratiowas used as a measure of the activity of cyp3a4.37caffeine and metabolites in plasma and urine weremeasured by hplc according to carrillo et al.33 inplasma, only caffeine (137x) was measured. the limitof quantification was 0.15 _mol/l. the magnitudes ofthe intra-assay and interassay cv values were consistentwith those previously published.33 the 24-hour urinarycaffeine n-3-demethylation index (5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil [afmu] + 1-methyluricacid [1u] + 1-methylxanthine [1x] + 1,7-dimethyluricacid [17u] + 1,7-dimethylxanthine [17x])/137x) wasalso used as a measure of cyp1a2 activity.33pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. the numberof volunteers included was decided on by experiencefrom previous studies. the low number of 5 emsand 5 pms at both doses of fluvoxamine was chosen todetect major but not minor inhibition effects. the concentration-versus-time data of parent drugs and metaboliteswere analyzed. the peak concentration (cmax) andthe time to peak concentration (tmax) were obtaineddirectly from the concentration-versus-time curves. thearea under the concentration-versus-time curve (auc)was calculated by the trapezoidal rule and extrapolatedto infinity by use of the last measured plasma concentrationand the elimination rate constant (_z), which wasdetermined by log-linear regression analysis of the terminal concentration-time points. the apparent half-life(t1Ã2) was determined by the log-linear regression of theterminal points of the drug concentration-versus-timecurve. the apparent oral plasma clearance (clsingle)was calculated as dose/auc. during steady state theoral clearance (clss) was also calculated as dose/aucduring the dosage interval of 12 hours for ems and of24 hours for pms. the steady-state concentration (css)of fluvoxamine was estimated as the mean of the troughvalues obtained on days 6 and 7.for the statistical analysis the fluvoxamine css andcmax values were divided by 2 in ems because of thedouble dose given to ems compared with pms. thecomputer program statistica, version 5.5 (statsoft inc,tulsa, okla) was used after logarithmic transformationof all pharmacokinetic parameters. then 95% confidenceintervals for the parameters were calculated fromthe antilog of the mean (n = 12, Â± 2.20 _ standard errorof the mean [sem]; n = 10, Â± 2.26 _ sem) of log-transformedvalues. a t test on log-transformed values ofcaffeine and omeprazole parameters was used to comparethe values between baseline and study periods 2and 3, respectively. no comparison was made betweenperiod 2 and period 3 because of the change of 2 volunteersin period 3. for the pharmacokinetic parametersof fluvoxamine, the t test for independent groups(ems compared with pms) was used for statistical calculations.spearmanÃs rank correlation coefficient wasused to compare the relationship between the aucs offluvoxamine and those of caffeine and omeprazole duringfluvoxamine treatment, respectively. for this study,p values .05 were regarded as significant.

102	Midazolam should be avoided in patients receiving the systemic antimycotics ketoconazole or itraconazole.	Interaction between ketoconazole, itraconazole, and midazolam was investigated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study of three phases at intervals of 4 weeks. Nine volunteers were given either 400 mg ketoconazole, 200 mg itraconazole, or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days. On day 4, the subjects ingested 7.5 mg midazolam. Plasma samples were collected and psychomotor performance was measured. Both ketoconazole and itraconazole increased the area under the midazolam concentration-time curve from 10 to 15 times (p < 0.001) and mean peak concentrations three to four times (p < 0.001) compared with the placebo phase. In psychomotor tests (e.g., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test), the interaction was statistically significant (p < 0.05) until at least 6 hours after drug administration. Inhibition of the cytochrome P450IIIA by ketoconazole and itraconazole may explain the observed pharmacokinetic interaction. Prescription of midazolam for patients receiving ketoconazole and itraconazole should be avoided.	material and methods study design we obtained informed written consent institutional approval study two male seven female volunteers age range years weight range kg we used randomized double blind crossover study design three phases intervals weeks the subjects given either mg ketoconazole nizoral orion helsinki finland mg itraconazole sporanox orion placebo orally pm daily days on day four subjects ingested mg midazolam dorrnicum hoffmann la roche basel switzerland ml water pm the volunteers fasted hours administration midazolam standard meal hours afterward ingestion alcohol coffee tea cola allowed test days smoking permitted blood sampling determination midazolam antimycotics blood sampled tubes containing ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid study pretreatments control compliance on day timed samples drawn immediately administration midazolam hours administration plasma separated within minutes stored c analyzed midazolam concentrations analyzed gas chromatography ketoconazole itraconazole concentrations analyzed hplc pharmacokinetics midazolam antimycotics pharmacokinetics midazolam antimycotics characterized area drug plasma concentrationtime curves auc o m calculated use trapezoidal rule peak concentrations cmax peak concentration times tmax for midazolam also calculated elimination half lives t1 6 psychomotor tests the effects midazolam psychomotor performance assessed time blood sampling use battery tests in digit symbol substitution test dsst number digits correctly substituted simple symbols minutes re orded t h e maddox wing test used measure coordination extraocular muscles subjective effects recorded horizontal visual analog scales mm length e g alert drowsy 9 statistical analysis all data expressed mean values sem data analyzed statistical program systat windows version systat evanston ill anova repeated measures used posteriori testing done tukey s test the pearson product moment correlation coefficient used investigate possible relationship ratio auc 0 m midazolam ketoconazole itraconazole phases auc 0 m midazolam placebo phase cmax ketoconazole itraconazole differences regarded statistically significant p	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
103	Mirtazapine and paroxetine: a drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects.	Paroxetine inhibits cytochrome P(450) 2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of mirtazapine. The possible drug-drug interaction between two pharmacologically distinct antidepressants, mirtazapine and paroxetine, has been investigated in a randomized, three-way crossover study in 24 healthy male and female subjects. After a titration phase of 3 days, each subject received single daily doses of 30 mg mirtazapine, 40 mg paroxetine or the combination for 6 days. Assessments included serial blood sampling for pharmacokinetics at steady state, cognitive testing using the test battery of CDR Ltd, a visual analogue mood rating scale (Bond and Lader) and the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. Paroxetine inhibits the metabolism of mirtazapine, as shown by increases of approximately 17% and 25% of the 24 h AUC's of mirtazapine and its demethyl metabolite, respectively. Mirtazapine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine. The combined administration of mirtazapine and paroxetine probably does not alter cognitive functioning or result in major changes on the visual analogue mood rating scale and Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, compared with the administration of either drug alone. The incidence of adverse events was lower during combined administration of mirtazapine and paroxetine than during administration of either drug alone. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, nausea, anxiety and somnolence were the most common adverse events during combined administration. These data suggest that the combination of mirtazapine and paroxetine is unlikely to lead to clinically relevant drug-drug interactions and can be used without dose adjustment of either drug. The combination may even be better tolerated than either drug alone.

104	Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of atorvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, in healthy subjects.	This study examined the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of atorvastatin, an investigational inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, in 50 healthy subjects by means of a randomized, double-blind parallel-group design. Volunteers received rising single and multiple doses of 0.5 to 80 mg/day atorvastatin (40 subjects) or placebo (10 subjects). The drug was administered once or twice daily for 14 days. Atorvastatin was well tolerated by healthy subjects. The most common adverse events reported after atorvastatin-headache and nausea-occurred as frequently after placebo. Atorvastatin peak concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values increased more than proportionally with atorvastatin dose after both single and multiple drug doses. The extent of atorvastatin absorption (AUC) was similar after once- or twice-daily drug administration. Steady-state drug concentrations were achieved by the third day of drug dosing. Mean elimination half-life values ranged from 11 to 24 hours. Atorvastatin accumulation was approximately 1.5- and 3.0-fold after once- and twice-daily administration, respectively. Atorvastatin produced dose-related reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that were similar after once- and twice-daily drug administration. Reductions in mean total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values ranged from 13% and 22% (2.5 mg/day) to 45% and 58% (80 mg/day), respectively (p < or = 0.0013 in comparison with placebo and with baseline over this dose range). In summary, atorvastatin doses of up to 80 mg/day were well tolerated and had significant cholesterol-lowering effects.	material and methods study design fifty healthy volunteers men women median age

105	Oral administration of a low dose of midazolam (75 microg) as an in vivo probe for CYP3A activity.	We investigated whether the oral administration of a low dose (75 micro g) of midazolam, a CYP3A probe, can be used to measure the in vivo CYP3A activity. Plasma concentrations of midazolam, 1'OH-midazolam and 4'OH-midazolam were measured after the oral administration of 7.5 mg and 75 micro g midazolam in 13 healthy subjects without medication, in four subjects pretreated for 2 days with ketoconazole (200 mg b.i.d.), a CYP3A inhibitor, and in four subjects pretreated for 4 days with rifampicin (450 mg q.d.), a CYP3A inducer. After oral administration of 75 micro g midazolam, the 30-min total (unconjugated + conjugated) 1'OH-midazolam/midazolam ratios measured in the groups without co-medication, with ketoconazole and with rifampicin were (mean+/-SD): 6.23+/-2.61, 0.79+/-0.39 and 56.1+/-12.4, respectively. No side effects were reported by the subjects taking this low dose of midazolam. Good correlations were observed between the 30-min total 1'OH-midazolam/midazolam ratio and midazolam clearance in the group without co-medication (r(2)=0.64, P<0.001) and in the three groups taken together (r(2)=0.91, P<0.0001). Good correlations were also observed between midazolam plasma levels and midazolam clearance, measured between 1.5 h and 4 h. A low oral dose of midazolam can be used to phenotype CYP3A, either by the determination of total 1'OH-midazolam/midazolam ratios at 30 min or by the determination of midazolam plasma levels between 1.5 h and 4 h after its administration.	subjects methods study design the study population consisted healthy volunteers caucasian north african black african male mean sd range age years years weight

106	Oral triazolam is potentially hazardous to patients receiving systemic antimycotics ketoconazole or itraconazole.	Triazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4 isozyme. Ketoconazole and itraconazole may seriously interact with some of the substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., terfenadine); hence their possible interaction with triazolam in humans is important to uncover. In this double-blind, randomized, three-phase crossover study, the interaction between ketoconazole, itraconazole, and triazolam was investigated. Nine healthy young volunteers received either 400 mg ketoconazole, 200 mg itraconazole, or matched placebo (control phase) orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each ingested a single 0.25 mg dose of triazolam. Plasma concentrations of triazolam and antimycotics were determined, and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 hours. On average, ketoconazole and itraconazole increased the area under the triazolam concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 22-fold and 27-fold (p < 0.001), the peak concentrations threefold (p < 0.001), and the elimination half-life sixfold and sevenfold (p < 0.001), respectively. In seven of the nine subjects, even the maximum concentration of triazolam in plasma was lower without the antimycotics than were the 17-hour concentrations during the ketoconazole and itraconazole phases. All pharmacodynamic effects (e.g., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test) revealed a significant difference between the antimycotic and placebo phases. Both ketoconazole and itraconazole seriously affect the pharmacokinetics of triazolam and increase the intensity and duration of its effects. Inhibition of CYP3A4 during the absorption and elimination phases of triazolam seems to explain the interaction observed. Because of the potentially hazardous consequences of this interaction, triazolam should be avoided if patients are using ketoconazole or itraconazole.	methods study design three male six female volunteers aged years weighing kg table i participated study giving written informed consent the study approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki a randomized double blind crossover study design three phases used intervals weeks the subjects given either mg ketoconazole nizoral orion helsinki finland mg itraconazole sporanox orion placebo orally pm daily days on day subject ingested mg dose triazolam halcion upjohn kalamazoo mich ml water pm the volunteers fasted hours administration triazolam standard meal hours afterward the use alcohol coffee tea cola allowed test days tobacco also forbidden blood sampling determination triazolam antimycotics blood sampled tubes contained ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid on day timed blood samples collected administration triazolam minutes hours administration plasma separated within minutes stored c analyzed plasma triazolam concentrations determined gas chromatography use modified method kroon et al 8 a hewlett packard hewlett packard company little falls del fused silica capillary column phenyl clinical pharmacology therapeutics december length internal diameter mm used column temperature c methoxydiazepam used internal standard nitrogen phosphorus detector detection the sensitivity method ng ml the coefficient variation day day ng ml n plasma samples ketoconazole itraconazole determinations taken hours fourth dose antimycotics i e hours administration triazolam ketoconazole itraconazole concentrations quantified hplc 9 1 the coefficients day to day variations 1 g ml n ng ml n respectively pharmacokinetics triazolam the pharmacokinetics triazolam characterized peak concentrations plasma c concentration peak times tmax elimination half lives t1 2 areas triazolam plasma concentrationtime curves auc 0 17 auc 0 00 1 calculated use trapezoidal rule 11 pharmacodynamic measurements the effects triazolam pharmacodynamics measured time blood sampling use battery tests volunteers trained perform study began in digit symbol substitution test dsst number digits correctly substituted simple symbols minutes recorded 12 the maddox wing test used measure coordination extraocular muscles in critical flicker fusion test leeds flicker fusion tester discrimination fusion flickering red light measured distance constant conditions standard pupil diameter provided means special spectacles subjective drowsiness recorded visual analog scale mm length alert drowsy 15 pos tural sway measured swaymeter erikois elektroniikka ltd orimattila finland first seconds eyes open seconds eyes closed for pharmacodynamic variable areas response time curves determined trapezoidal rule hours auc 0 7 statistical analysis all data expressed mean values sem anova repeated measures used posteriori testing done tukey test the tmax values compared friedman s twoway anova wilcoxon signed rank test pearson s product moment correlation coefficient used investigate possible relationship ratio auc 0 17 triazolam ketoconazole itraconazole phases auc 0 17 triazolam placebo phase versus c ketoconazole itraconazole differences regarded statistically significant p values data analyzed statistical program systat windows version systat evanston ill	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
107	Paroxetine potentiates the central nervous system side effects of perphenazine: contribution of cytochrome P4502D6 inhibition in vivo.	Paroxetine is a frequently used antidepressant and a potent inhibitor of the CYP2D6 isozyme in vitro (inhibition constant [Ki] = 0.15 micromol/L). Most classic antipsychotic agents such as perphenazine are metabolized by the CYP2D6 isozyme and are often coadministered with antidepressant agents. This study assessed the extent of changes in CYP2D6 isozyme activity in vivo after pretreatment with paroxetine and its consequences on perphenazine kinetics and central nervous system effects. Eight extensive metabolizers for CYP2D6 were administered a single dose of perphenazine (0.11 mg/kg orally) or placebo following a randomized double-blind design. Perphenazine plasma concentrations and effects were assessed for a period of 8 hours. Subsequently, subjects were treated with a standard therapeutic dose of paroxetine (20 mg/day orally) for 10 days and test sessions with perphenazine and placebo were repeated. Paroxetine treatment resulted in a twofold to 21-fold decrease in CYP2D6 activity (p < 0.001). After pretreatment with paroxetine, perphenazine peak plasma concentrations increased twofold to 13-fold (p < 0.01). This was associated with a significant increase in central nervous system side effects of perphenazine, including oversedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, and impairment of psychomotor performance and memory (p < 0.05). Coadministration of perphenazine after pretreatment with a standard therapeutic dose of paroxetine increased the plasma concentration and central nervous system side effects of perphenazine, primarily as a result of inhibition of the CYP2D6 isozyme. In patients who are at steady state with paroxetine, a reduction of perphenazine dose may be required to prevent central nervous system side effects.	material and methods subjects subjects healthy

108	Paroxetine shifts imipramine metabolism.	The combination of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with tricyclic antidepressants has proven useful in treatment-resistant depression but has the potential for adverse drug-drug interactions. In the present study, the metabolism of a single dose of imipramine was studied before and after treatment with paroxetine. Paroxetine induced significant elevations of approximately 50% in half-life, area under the curve, and Cmax of imipramine and decreased clearance twofold. The effects on desipramine pharmacokinetics were even more pronounced. These findings indicate a significant interaction of paroxetine with the CYP2D6 isoenzyme.	methods2.1. subjectseleven male inpatient veterans participated inthe study after informed consent was obtained.subjects ranged in age from 31 to 60 years(mean = 45.6 years). there were six caucasian,two african-american, and three hispanic subjects.subjects were excluded if they had a historyof liver, renal, or cardiac disease or were anemic.before entry in the study, all subjects received amedical and psychiatric evaluation with completephysical examination, complete blood count withdifferential, chemistry profile (sma-20) includingliver and renal function, thyroid function tests,urinalysis, toxicology screen, and an electrocardiogram.all subjects had normal liver and renalfunction, and those subjects with a history of alcoholconsumption had an average of 19 days ofabstinence before beginning the study. subjectswere hospitalized during the entire length of thestudy. seven subjects smoked an average of 22cigarettes per day (range 7-30 per day) and smokedthe same number of cigarettes throughout thestudy. one subject was dropped from data analysisbecause he was inadvertently given an extra doseof imipramine on the tirst day of the study. 2.2. study designthe protocol lasted 15 days and was an openlabel, parallel design in which each subject servedas his own control. metabolism of imipramine wasstudied under two conditions: single dose imipraminealone and single dose imipramine after 4days of treatment with paroxetine. at baseline,subjects received a single so-mg dose of imipramineat 0800 h. blood was collected at 0 hbefore imipramine administration and 1, 2, 3,4, 6,8, 12,24,48, 72, and 96 h after administration. onday 5, subjects began treatment with 30 mg ofparoxetine at 08:oo h, which continued dailythroughout the time of imipramine sampling.paroxetine was continued in an effort to maintainsteady-state plasma levels. on day 9, after 4 daysof paroxetine administration, subjects received anothersingle 50-mg dose of imipramine at 08:oo h.this was followed by serial blood draws obtainedat 0 h before administration of imipramine andparoxetine, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96,120, and 144 h after administration. an i.v.catheter was used for blood collection on days 1and 9 of the study. blood samples were drawn inheparinized tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rev./minfor 30 min; plasma was frozen at -70Â¡c untilanalyzed.2.3. proceduresthe paroxetine reference standard was agenerous gift of smithkline beecham pharmaceuticals(philadelphia, pa, usa). plasmalevels of imipramine and desipramine were determinedby the high-performance liquid chromatography(hplc) method of reece et al. (1979)with the following modifications: the plasma extractionwas performed by shaking the samples at200 rev./mm for 30 min using a rotatory shaker.the hplc eluting solvent consisted of acetonitrileand 0.015% aqueous phosphoric acid (45:55 v/v).concentrations of imipramine and desipraminestandards were 0,2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 rig/mlwith 25 @ml trimipramine as internal standard.assay sensitivity for imipramine and desipraminewas 2-3 n&nl.plasma paroxetine levels were determined by thehplc method of brett et al. (1987) using analltech spherisorb ods 2/5-u column (250 x 4.6mm i.d.) fitted with a c-18 guard column bywaters. before injection onto the hplc, sampleswere partially purified using c 18 sep-pak chromatography(samples were eluted using 100% methanolafter a 20% methanol wash). the standardsconsisted of paroxetine concentrations of 0,25,50,75, 100, 150, and 200 ng with 25 ng maprotiline asan internal standard per 50-~1 volume. these werederivatized using the same protocol that wasfollowed for the samples. assay sensitivity forparoxetine was 2 ng/ml.the hplc system consisted of a waters 600emultisolvent delivery pump with automatic injectorwisp model 712, a waters 470 fluorescencedetector, and a sp4290 integrator by spectraphysics.2.4. pharmacokineticsthe elimination rate constant (b) was determinedby the slope of a log-linear regression. half-life(t& was determined by 0.693/b. area under theplasma concentration curve (auc) was determinedby the trapezoidal rule through the last samplingpoint and extrapolated through infinity. theapparent oral plasma clearance (cl,,,) was determinedby dividing the dose by the auc. theapparent volume of distribution (voral) wascalculated by dividing the plasma clearance by b.peak plasma concentrations (c,,,) and the timeto reach concentrations (t,,,,,) were determineddirectly from data inspection. paired t tests wereused to evaluate the differences between baselineand post-paroxetine measures.

109	Paroxetine, a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor, diminishes the stereoselective O-demethylation and reduces the hypoalgesic effect of tramadol.	Tramadol hydrochloride (INN, tramadol) exerts its antinociceptive action through a monoaminergic effect mediated by the parent compound and an opioid effect mediated mainly by the O-demethylated metabolite (+)-M1. O-demethylation is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. Paroxetine is a very potent inhibitor of CYP2D6. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of paroxetine pretreatment on the biotransformation and the hypoalgesic effect of tramadol. With and without paroxetine pretreatment (20 mg daily for 3 consecutive days), the formation of M1 and the analgesic effect of 150 mg of tramadol were studied in 16 healthy extensive metabolizers of sparteine in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover study by use of experimental pain models. With paroxetine pretreatment, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of (+)- and (-)-tramadol was increased (37% [P = .001] and 32% [P = .002], respectively), and the corresponding AUCs of(+)- and (-)-M1 were decreased (67% [P = .0004] and 40% [P = .0008], respectively). (+)-M1 and (-)-M1 could be determined in all subjects throughout the study period regardless of paroxetine pretreatment. The sums of differences between postmedication and premedication values of pain measures differed between the placebo/tramadol and the placebo/placebo combination, with median values as follows: pressure pain tolerance threshold, 390 kPa (95% confidence interval [CI], 211 to 637 kPa) versus -84 kPa (95% CI, - 492 to -32 kPa) (P = .001); single sural nerve stimulation pain tolerance threshold, 25.8 mA (95% CI, 15.3 to 29.8 mA) versus 9.0 mA (95% CI, 1.5 to 14.8 mA) (P = .005); pain summation threshold, 10.7 mA (95% CI, 5.2 to 17.6 mA) versus 5.0 mA (95% CI, 2.8 to 11.2 mA) (P = .066); cold pressor pain, -4.2 cm x s (95% CI, -6.8 to -1.9 cm x s) versus -0.4 cm x s (-1.4 to 1.4 cm x s) (P = .002); and discomfort, -4.7 cm (95% CI, -10.6 to -2.8 cm) versus 0.5 cm (-0.1 to 1.4 cm) (P = .002). The sums of differences of the paroxetine/tramadol combination also differed from placebo/tramadol for some of the measures, with median values as follows: cold pressor pain, -2.2 cm x s (95% CI, -3.7 to -0.4 cm x s) (P = .036, compared with placebo/tramadol); and discomfort, -2.0 cm (95% CI, -5.6 to -1.2 cm) (P = .056). For the other measures, the hypoalgesic effect was retained on the paroxetine/tramadol combination, with median values as follows: pressure pain tolerance threshold, 389 kPa (95% CI, 141 to 715 kPa) (P = .278, compared with placebo/tramadol); single sural nerve stimulation pain tolerance threshold, 12.5 mA (95% CI, 6.2 to 28.3 mA) (P = .278); and pain summation threshold, 8.2 mA (95% CI, 4.4 to 14.6 mA) (P = .179). Paroxetine in combination with placebo showed no analgesic effect. It is concluded that paroxetine at a dosage of 20 mg once daily for 3 consecutive days significantly inhibits the metabolism of tramadol to its active metabolite M1 and reduces but does not abolish the hypoalgesic effect of tramadol in human experimental pain models, particularly in opioid-sensitive tests.	methods subjects fourteen male female healthy drugfree except oral contraceptives

110	Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of the inhibition of alprazolam by citalopram and fluoxetine.	The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant fluoxetine inhibits alprazolam metabolism in vivo by inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme. Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant that has not yet been fully evaluated with respect to its potential for cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated drug interactions in vivo. Building on the existing in vitro and in vivo evidence that suggest a minimal effect of citalopram on cytochrome P450 3A4, we hypothesized that therapeutic doses of citalopram (20 mg/d), as compared with fluoxetine (20 mg/d), would cause less impairment in the metabolism of the probe drug alprazolam (1 mg) through inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme as measured by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters in vivo. We found that fluoxetine prolonged the half-life of alprazolam by 16% and increased the area under the curve 0-infinity of alprazolam by 32%, while citalopram did not affect these parameters, although the time of maximum concentration of alprazolam was prolonged by 30 minutes after citalopram administration. Neither selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor significantly affected the pharmacodynamic profile of alprazolam. This experiment suggests differential effects by citalopram and fluoxetine on alprazolam kinetics.	materials and methods study design the study protocol consent form approved research ethics board

111	Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of oral midazolam with ketoconazole, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and nefazodone.	The objective of this study was to investigate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between midazolam and fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, nefazodone, and ketoconazole. Forty healthy subjects were randomized to receive one of the four study drugs for 12 days in a parallel study design: fluoxetine 60 mg per day for 5 days, followed by 20 mg per day for 7 days; fluvoxamine titrated to a daily dose of 200 mg; nefazodone titrated to a daily dose of 400 mg; or ketoconazole 200 mg per day. All 40 subjects received oral midazolam solution before and after the 12-day study drug regimen. Blood samples for determination of midazolam concentrations were drawn for 24 hours after each midazolam dose and used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. The effects of the study drugs on midazolam pharmacodynamics were assessed using the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). The mean area under the curve (AUC) for midazolam was increased 771.9% by ketoconazole and 444.0% by nefazodone administration. However, there was no significant change in midazolam AUC as a result of fluoxetine (13.4% decrease) and a statistical trend for fluvoxamine (66.1% increase) administration. Pharmacodynamic data are consistent with pharmacokinetic data indicating that nefazodone and ketoconazole resulted in significant increases in midazolam-related cognition impairment. The significant impairment in subjects' cognitive function reflects the changes in midazolam clearance after treatment with ketoconazole and nefazodone. These results suggest that caution with the use of midazolam is warranted with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.	methods subjects forty male female subjects caucasian hispanic african american descent

112	Pharmacokinetic evaluation of co-administration of nefazodone and lithium in healthy subjects.	To evaluate the possible pharmacokinetic interaction between nefazodone and lithium. Twelve healthy volunteers received nefazodone 200 mg b.i.d. for 5 days. A 4-day washout phase followed from day 6 to day 9. From day 10 to day 20, escalating doses of lithium 250 mg b.i.d. to 500 mg b.i.d. were given; the daily dose of 1000 mg was obtained on day 13. From day 16 to day 20, nefazodone 200 mg b.i.d. was added to the lithium dosing regimen. Venous blood sampling was performed on days 5, 15 and 20 for 0- to 48-h-pharmacokinetic analysis. Nefazodone and its metabolites, hydroxynefazodone, mCPP and triazoledione were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Lithium was assayed by flame photometry. Co-administration of nefazodone did not modify pharmacokinetic parameters of lithium at steady-state. Comparison of the area under the plasma or serum concentration-versus-time curve calculated from 0-12 h (AUC0-12) of nefazodone and hydroxynefazodone revealed no significant differences when nefazodone was administered alone or with lithium. The mean maximum peak plasma concentration Cmax and AUC0-12 of meta-chlorophenyl-piperazine (mCPP) were significantly reduced by 27% (P < 0.001) and 16% (P < 0.001) with the co-administration. The mean Cmax and AUC0-12 of triazoledione were reduced by 23% (P < 0.005) and 16% (P < 0.01) by the co-administration. Since there were no clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of the parent compounds or metabolites, and the combination was well tolerated, no dosage adjustments of nefazodone or lithium are necessary when they are co-administered.	methods after approval was obtained from the ethics committee, 13 heal- thy volunteers aged between 18 and 41 years, including 11 male and two female subjects, were enrolled in this open-label multiple-dose study, after signing an informed consent form. the study was carried out in accordance with the declaration of helsinki. the subjects had previously been screened for dextromethorphan oxi- dative phenotype. the result of this test was not used as an inclu- sion or exclusion criterion. the subjects were selected on the basis of good general health as determined by no clinically signiÃcant deviations from normal in baseline measurements of medical his- tory, physical examination, clinical laboratory determination and electrocardiogram (ecg) conducted within 14 days prior to study enrollment. any subject with evidence of cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, thyroid or metabolic dysfunction as well as recent drug or alcohol abuse and/or positive urine screening for drugs of abuse was excluded. individuals who had donated blood within 3 months prior to the beginning of the study could not be enrolled. the subjects were also checked for thyroid function by free thyroxine (ft4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) tests. no concom- itant medication other than contraceptives for women of child- bearing age or medication for the treatment of any adverse events was permitted for the duration of the study. laboratory tests were performed again within 48 h prior to day 1 and at discharge. vital signs including respiratory rate, sitting blood pressure and pulse rate, which were recorded during pre-study screening, each day before study drug administration and at the completion of the study. a complete physical examination and an ecg were done again at discharge. following the daily investigatorsÃ questioning and examination of the subjects, all clinical adverse events, whether believed by the investigator to be related or unrelated to the treatment, were recorded from the time the subjects entered the investigators clinic on day 1 of the study until their discharge on day 23. moreover, neurological tests such as the segmental co- ordination test, romberg sign and the occurrence of tremors, were performed daily from day 10 to day 21, 2 h after the morning dose intake in order to assess any neurological signs or symptoms. body temperature was measured from day 10 to day 21. the study was carried out in three sequential stages. first the subjects were administered nefazodone tablets 200 mg b.i.d. (at 0800 hours and 2000 hours) from day 1 to day 5. the dose of 400 mg Â¾ d)1 is the target dose for nefazodone in practice. a 4-day washout period then followed from day 6 to day 9. from day 10 to day 15, subjects received an ascending dose of lithium carbonate tablets 250 mg b.i.d. (at 0800 hours and 2000 hours). the starting dose was 250 mg b.i.d. and it was adjusted to achieve a serum level of lithium within the recommended therapeutic range (i.e. 0.5Ã0.8 mmol Â¾ l)1) by increasing daily with half a tablet up to 500 mg b.i.d. finally, from day 16 to day 20, nefazodone 200 mg b.i.d. was co-administered with lithium. subjects stayed at the investigation clinic from the evening of day 4 until the morning of day 7 and from the evening of day 14 until the morning of day 23. for other days, the subjects went to the clinic for dosing and blood sampling. all dosings were administered 30 min before breakfast and dinner with 200 ml of tap water. measurement of nefazodone and its metabolite plasma concentrations a venous blood sample of 5 ml was collected at 0 h of day 1 (pre-dose). blood samples for the determination of the trough concentrations observed just before the morning dose (cmin) were obtained prior to the dose given at 0800 hours on days 3 and 4, 18 and 19. prior to the dose given at 0800 hours on days 5 and 20, serial blood samples were taken for 0- to 48-h-pharmacokinetic analysis at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 h and 48 h. venous blood samples (5 ml each) for evaluation of nefazodone and its metabo- lites hydroxynefazodone, mcpp and triazoledione plasma con- centrations were collected using becton-dickinson vacutainers with tripotassium edta as the anticoagulant. the separated plasma was stored frozen at or below )20 (cid:176)c until anlysis. concentrations of nefazodone and its metabolites in plasma were determined by an hplc method. the analytes were detected using uv absorbance at 254 nm. the validated limits of quantiÃ- cation were 10 ng Â¾ ml)1 for nefazodone and triazoledione, 2.5 ng Â¾ ml)1 for mcpp and 5 ng Â¾ ml)1 for hydroxynefazodone. measurement of lithium serum concentrations subjects remained within the daily monitoring for lithium serum levels was performed to ensure that (i.e. 0.5Ã0.8 mmol Â¾ l)1). prior to the dosing at 0800 hours from day 10 to day 20, venous blood samples for determination of lithium level were collected. moreover, venous blood samples for the determi- nation of lithium cmin were obtained prior to the dose at 0800 hours from day 13 to day 15 and on days 18 and 19. prior to the dose at 0800 hours on days 15 and 20 serial blood samples were therapeutic range peformed for 0- to 48-h-pharmacokinetic analysis at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 h and 48 h. each blood sample of 5 ml for lithium serum concentration was collected using dry tubes. after collection, blood was stored at room temperature until clotted. the separated serum was then sent to the laboratory in charge of the assays. the quantitative assay of lithium was performed by Ãame photometry [34] with phf 102 lisabio. before subject level de- termination, a daily phf 102 lisabio calibration was performed with biotrol solution for zero calibration and epam biotrol solu- tion for standard curves. the internal standard was a solution of kcl 11.18 g Â¾ l)1. the calibration curves performed during the study were straight lines over the studied range of concentrations. the day-to-day precision of the method was equal to 2.29% and the accuracy was equal to 1.01%. pharmacokinetic analysis pharmacokinetic parameters for lithium and nefazodone and its metabolites at steady-state, when drugs were administered alone on day 15 and on day 5, respectively, and after co-administration on day 20, were determined by non-compartmental methods [35] with the program siphar [36]. the maximum concentration (cmax), of lithium and nefazodone and its metabolites as well as corre- sponding times to peak, (tmax), were determined for each subject at steady-state by visual inspection of concentration-versus-time proÃles. the area under serum or plasma concentration-versus- time curve, (auc0Ã12), were calculated during a 12-h dosing interval by linear trapezoidal rule. the trough concentrations observed just before the morning dose, (cmin), were noted on the 2 days prior to and on the study days of pharmacokinetic handling. cmin evening was recorded 12 h after the morning dose on the days of blood sampling. the half-life value was not calculated between two consecutive dosings, i.e. 12 h, since sampling is at best only 2 times usual half-life. statistical analysis the main purpose of this study was to test whether co-adminis- tration of nefazodone modiÃed the pharmacokinetic parameters characteristic of lithium (cmax, tmax and auc0Ã12) at steady-state. the study sample size of 12 subjects was chosen to give 80% power to detect a 13% change in lithium cmin from 0.700 meq Â¾ l)1 (two- sided studentÃs t-test, alpha (cid:136) 0.05, variance (cid:136) 0.0112 [31]). this sample size gave also 80% power to detect a 24% change in ne- fazodone cmax after lithium co-administration (two-sided studentÃs log transformation, alpha (cid:136) 0.05, variance (cid:136) 0.06 ac- t-test, cording to a previous nefazodone study Ã unpublished data). the data characteristic of lithium at steady-state, when it was admin- istered alone on day 15 and with nefazodone on day 20, were analysed after a decimal log transformation using a studentÃs two-sided t-test for paired data or a non-parametric wilcoxon test, depending on the degree of normality. the values for tmax only had to be analysed by a non-parametric wilcoxon test. the 95% con- Ãdence intervals of the diÂerence in means of the two treatments (co-administration minus alone), were calculated to evaluate the inÃuence of nefazodone on lithium pharmacokinetics. the three values of cmin measured prior to the morning dose of lithium ad- ministered alone on days 14, 15 and 16 on one hand and with nefazodone on the other hand, were used to evaluate whether steady-state had been reached. they were analysed after a decimal log transformation by a repeated measures anova model [37] including subject and day eÂects. if the day eÂect was statistically signiÃcant, tukeyÃs multiple comparison procedure [38] was used to determine that steady-state was achieved by the day of serial measurements. the eÂect of lithium on the pharmacokinetic han- dling of nefazodone was evaluated using the above methodology. subject demographics, pre- and post-physical examinations, vital signs, ecgs, adverse events, laboratory clinical data and neuro- logical tests were tabulated. the statistical analysis was performed with the sas package (version 6.10). all signiÃcance tests were carried out at a nominal signiÃcance level of 0.05. 925	DDI Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	0	2	2
113	Pharmacokinetic interaction between oral lovastatin and verapamil in healthy subjects: role of P-glycoprotein inhibition by lovastatin.	Lovastatin is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme. Verapamil is a substrate of both P-gp and CYP3A4. It is therefore likely that lovastatin can alter the absorption and metabolism of verapamil. The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil and one of its metabolites, norverapamil, were compared in 14 healthy male Korean volunteers (age range 22-28 years) who had been administered verapamil (60 mg) orally in the presence or absence of oral lovastatin (20 mg). The design of the experiment was a standard 2 x 2 crossover model in random order. The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil were significantly altered by the co-administration of lovastatin compared to the control. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC (0-infinity)) and the peak plasma concentration of verapamil were significantly increased by 62.8 and 32.1%, respectively. Consequently, the relative bioavailability of verapamil was also significantly increased (by 76.5%). The (AUC (0-infinity)) of norverapamil and the terminal half-life of verapamil did not significantly changed with lovastatin coadministration. The metabolite-parent ratio was significantly reduced (29.2%) in the presence of lovastatin. Lovastatin increased the absorption of verapamil by inhibiting P-gp and inhibited the first-pass metabolism of verapamil by inhibiting CYP3A4 in the intestine and/or liver in humans.	materials methods chemicals verapamil norverapamil lovastatin propranolol hydrochloride internal standard high performance liquid chromatographic hplc analysis verapamil norverapamil purchased sigma aldrich st louis mo verapamil capsules conventional fast release form mg lovastatin tablets mg purchased yungjin pharma corporation seoul republic korea choongwea pharma corporation seoul republic korea respectively other chemicals reagent grade hplc grade subjects fourteen healthy male korean volunteers mean age years range years average weight kg range kg average height cm range cm participated study the subjects good health determined review medical history physical examination electrocardiogram clinical laboratory measurements serum levels glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase sgot u l glutamic pyruvic transaminase sgpt u l creatinine mg dl all data reported mean values standard deviation sd informed consent obtained subject explaining nature purpose study the protocol study approved institutional review board chosun university hospital gwangju republic korea experimental protocol five days study subjects asked refrain consuming drugs beverages containing xanthines smoking the subjects given standardized meals standardized conditions the night study subjects hospitalized pm required fast noon next day in early morning 12 h overnight fast forearm vein cannulated three way stopcock hyupsung medical seoul republic korea heparinized nacl injectable solution u ml flushed prevent blood clotting each volunteer received oral dose mg one capsule verapamil n 7 without n 7 mg tablet lovastatin ml water standard crossover model random order there 1 week washout period doses a blood sample approximately ml collected control h postadministration verapamil 0 5 ml heparinized nacl injectable solution u ml injected blood sampling following centrifugation blood sample 1 ml aliquots plasma stored 70 c ilshin lab yangju republic korea used hplc analysis verapamil norverapamil eur j clin pharmacol measure systolic blood pressure pharmacokinetic analysis blood pressure measured brachium supine position control administration h drug administration rhodamine 123 retention assay the p gp overexpressed multidrug resistant human breast carcinoma cell line mcf 7 adr cells seeded 24well plates at confluence cells incubated fetal bovine serum free dulbecco s modified eagle s medium h the culture medium replaced hanks balanced salt solution cells incubated 37 c min following incubation cells m rhodamine 123 presence absence lovastatin m verapamil m min medium completely aspirated the cells washed three times ice cold phosphate buffer ph lysed lysis buffer the rhodamine123 fluorescence cell lysates measured using excitation emission wavelengths nm respectively fluorescence values normalized total protein content sample presented percentage ratio control the total area plasma concentration time curve time zero last measured time plasma auc0 t calculated using trapezoidal rule method the peak plasma concentration cmax time reach cmax tmax directly read experimental data the elimination rate constant kel calculated log linear regression verapamil concentration data elimination phase terminal half life calculated 0 693 kel the relative oral bioavailability rb verapamil calculated dividing aucverapamil lovastatin aucverapamil without lovastatin the metabolite parent drug ratio mr obtained dividing aucnorverapamil aucverapamil statistical analysis p 0 05 deemed statistically significant test sigmastat ver systat software san jose ca two means paired data if data normally distributed alternative nonparametric signed rank test performed compare means two groups all results expressed mean sd determination verapamil norverapamil plasma hplc	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
114	Pharmacokinetic interactions between alitretinoin and ketoconazole or simvastatin or ciclosporin A.	Based on in vitro data with isolated cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes, alitretinoin interacts only with CYP3A4, and the potential for drug-drug interactions is considered negligible. To confirm in humans the lack of potential interactions between CYP3A4 and alitretinoin in vivo. This was a multiple-dose, open-label, parallel-group, single-centre study, which enrolled 54 healthy male volunteers aged 18-45 years. Subjects were divided into three groups, with 18 in each group: group 1 received either alitretinoin 30 mg and ketoconazole 200 mg, group 2 alitretinoin 30 mg and simvastatin 40 mg, and group 3 alitretinoin 30 mg and ciclosporin A 300-mg. At the highest therapeutic dose of 30 mg, alitretinoin had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ketoconazole and ciclosporin A. There was a significant but not clinically relevant effect of simvastatin on the area under the curve (AUC) of plasma concentration vs. time and on maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) after repeated administration of alitretinoin. Exposure to simvastatin concomitantly with alitretinoin was decreased by 16% for AUC and 23% for C(max). The CYP3A4 Â± PgP substrates of simvastatin and ciclosporin A did not affect the single or repeated dose PK of alitretinoin. The strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor ketoconazole led to significant increases in both AUC and C(max) values for alitretinoin. Single and repeated doses of alitretinoin do not alter the PK of ciclosporin A and ketoconazole. Simvastatin levels were slightly but significantly reduced by co-administration of alitretinoin. Substrates of CYP3A4 did not affect the PK of alitretinoin. However, ketoconazole significantly increased the plasma levels of alitretinoin, therefore, co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole may require a dose reduction of alitretinoin.	methods this study conformed fully principles declaration helsinki applicable amendments the study fully adhered principles outlined guidelines good clinical practice ich tripartite

115	Pharmacokinetic interactions between nelfinavir and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and simvastatin.	3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are effective agents in lowering cholesterol and triglycerides and are being used by human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients to treat the lipid elevation that may be associated with antiretroviral therapy. Many HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and protease inhibitors are metabolized by the same cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). In addition, many protease inhibitors are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. Therefore, coadministration of these two classes of drugs may cause significant drug interactions. This open-label, multiple-dose study was performed to determine the interactions between nelfinavir, a protease inhibitor, and two HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, atorvastatin and simvastatin, in healthy volunteers. Thirty-two healthy subjects received either atorvastatin calcium (10 mg once a day) or simvastatin (20 mg once a day) for the first 14 days of the study. Nelfinavir (1,250 mg twice a day) was added on days 15 to 28. Pharmacokinetic assessment was performed on days 14 and 28. The study drugs were well tolerated. Nelfinavir increased the steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time curve during one dosing period (AUC(tau)) of atorvastatin 74% and the maximum concentration (C(max)) of atorvastatin 122% and increased the AUC(tau) of simvastatin 505% and the C(max) of simvastatin 517%. Neither atorvastatin nor simvastatin appeared to alter the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir. It is recommended that coadministration of simvastatin with nelfinavir should be avoided, whereas atorvastatin should be used with nelfinavir with caution.	materials and methods study design. this was an open-label, sequential, multiple-dose, single-center study to determine the pharmacokinetic interaction between nelÃnavir and ator- vastatin or nelÃnavir and simvastatin in healthy volunteers. thirty-two subjects 3445 3446 hsyu et al. antimicrob. agents chemother. were enrolled in the study. the study was performed at phoenix international life sciences, inc. (neptune, n.j.). inclusion and exclusion criteria. healthy male or female subjects 18 to 55 years old were enrolled after the investigation review board approved the study protocol and subjects signed the informed consent form. subjects were excluded if they took medications that might affect cyp3a4 activities, took alcohol or illegal drugs or smoked during the study, or were positive for hiv, hepatitis b, or hepatitis c. treatment. subjects were divided into two groups. the two groups were roughly matched for gender, race, and age. the treatments were as follows. treatment group 1. in period 1, subjects received atorvastatin calcium (lipi- tor; 10 mg once a day [qd]) in the morning for the Ãrst 14 days of the study. in period 2, subjects received atorvastatin calcium (10 mg qd) plus nelÃnavir (viracept; 1,250 mg twice a day [bid]) for an additional 14 days (days 15 to 28). all atorvastatin and nelÃnavir doses were taken with food. treatment group 2. in period 1, subjects received simvastatin (zocor; 20 mg qd) in the morning for the Ãrst 14 days of the study. in period 2, subjects received simvastatin (20 mg qd) plus nelÃnavir (1,250 mg bid) for an additional 14 days (days 15 to 28). all simvastatin and nelÃnavir doses were taken with food. pharmacokinetic sample collection. (i) atorvastatin and simvastatin sample collections. trough samples (7 ml) were collected prior to dosing on days 1, 5, 10, 20, and 25. on days 14 and 28, serial blood samples (7 ml) were collected predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 24 h postdose. (ii) nelÃnavir sample collections. trough samples (7 ml) were collected prior to initiation of nelÃnavir on day 14 and prior to dosing on days 20 and 25. serial blood samples (7 ml) were collected predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h postdose. bioanalytical procedures. (i) nelÃnavir and ag1402. concentrations of nelÃ- navir and its active metabolite ag1402, previous named m8 (25), in plasma were measured by a validated reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method with uv detection at ppd development inc. (richmond, va.). plasma samples (0.25 ml) containing various concentrations of nelÃnavir and ag1402 were mixed with an internal standard [6,7-dimethyl-2,3-di(2-pydridyl)-quinoxa- line] solution (0.25 ml). each sample was mixed with 0.5 ml of 0.1 n ammonium hydroxide (ph 10.5) and then extracted by 2.0 ml of ethyl acetate/acetonitrile (9:1 ratio) mixture. the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 _ g, and the organic layer was transferred to a new tube and evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream at 50Â¡c. the residue was reconstituted with 0.15 ml of mobile phase (25 mm sodium phosphate, monobasic ph 3.4, acetonitrile-methanol; 60:32.5:7.5 by volume) and subjected to high-performance liquid chromatogra- phy. separation was achieved on a waters symmetry c18 column at 30Â¡c with a Ãow rate of 1.5 ml and detection of nelÃnavir and ag1402 via uv detection at 220 nm. the typical elution times of nelÃnavir, ag1402, and the internal stan- dard were 14.5, 6, and 11 min, respectively. this method was validated within a concentration range of 0.05 to 10.0 _g/ml for nelÃnavir and ag1402. the standard curves were linear with r2 values of _0.997. nelÃnavir and ag1402 were stable (_20% loss from the baseline) for at least 21 months when stored at _20Â¡c. the precision (percent coefÃcient of variation) of the assay for nelÃnavir and ag1402 was _7.2 and 6.6%, respectively. the accuracy (deviation from the nominal concentrations) of the assay for nelÃnavir and ag1402 was _16.0 to _6.6% and _5.9 to _1.7%, respectively. (ii) atorvastatin and simvastatin. plasma samples were analyzed for atorva- statin equivalent concentrations (as the total of atorvastatin acid and its active metabolites) or simvastatin equivalent concentrations (as the total of simvastatin acid and its active metabolites) by a validated enzyme inhibition assay for hmg- coa reductase inhibitors (7) at phoenix international life sciences, inc. (saint- laurent, quebec, canada). atorvastatin or simvastatin was isolated from 0.25 ml of human plasma by protein precipitation with acetonitrile/acetone (95:5, vol/ vol). the atorvastatin or simvastatin equivalent concentration was estimated by inhibition of the production of [14c]mevalone from [14c]hmg-coa in the presence of hmg-coa reductase from rat liver microsomes and cofactor. since it was an enzyme inhibition assay, all of the atorvastatin or simvastatin and its active metabolites in plasma capable of inhibiting hmg-coa reductase was quantiÃed. therefore, atorvastatin or simvastatin concentrations were expressed as atorvastatin or simvastatin equivalents. the standard curves were linear with r2 values of _0.997 for both atorvastatin and simvastatin. this method was validated within concentration ranges of 0.18 to 7.35 ng/ml for atorvastatin and 0.3 to 15.2 ng/ml for simvastatin. the precision levels (percent coefÃcient of variation) of the assay for atorvastatin and simvastatin were _11.3 and 25.4%, respectively. the accuracy levels (deviation from the nominal concentrations) of the assay for atorvastatin and simvastatin were within 0.1 to 3.7% and _6.4 to 3.4%, respectively. safety evaluations. adverse events and changes from the baseline laboratory parameters were monitored and evaluated. metabolic laboratory parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (ldl), triglycerides, glu- cose, insulin, and c-peptide, were determined after an overnight fast on screen- ing, before Ãrst dosing, and on days 14 and 28. statistical analysis. standard noncompartmental methods were used to cal- culate pharmacokinetic parameters. the geometric mean and its associated 95% conÃdence interval (ci) of the steady-state auc during one dosing period (auc_) were calculated (time zero to 24 h postdose for atorvastatin and simva- statin and time zero to 12 h postdose for nelÃnavir and ag1402). the geometric mean and its associated 95% ci of the cmax were calculated for atorvastatin, simvastatin, and nelÃnavir. the ratio and its associated 90% ci of the geometric mean of the auc_ and cmax of atorvastatin and simvastatin in the presence and absence of nelÃnavir were also calculated. analysis of variance was used to compare logarithmically transformed parameter values for atorvastatin and sim- vastatin in the absence and presence of nelÃnavir, with the exception of tmax, which was analyzed by a nonparametric method. pharmacokinetic parameters for nelÃnavir and ag1402 were compared to results from previous studies with healthy volunteers who had taken nelÃnavir (1,250 mg bid) for at least 10 days. mean baseline values and percent changes in total cholesterol, ldl, and trig- lycerides on days 14 and 28 were calculated for each group.

116	Pharmacokinetic interactions between protease inhibitors and statins in HIV seronegative volunteers: ACTG Study A5047.	Lipid lowering therapy is used increasingly in persons with HIV infection in the absence of safety data or information on drug interactions with antiretroviral agents. The primary objectives of this study were to examine the effects of ritonavir (RTV) plus saquinavir soft-gel (SQVsgc) capsules on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin, and the effect of pravastatin on the pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir (NFV) in order to determine clinically important drug-drug interactions. Randomized, open-label study in healthy, HIV seronegative adults at AIDS Clinical Trials Units across the USA. Three groups of subjects (arms 1, 2, and 3) received pravastatin, simvastatin or atorvastatin (40 mg daily each) from days 1-4 and 15-18. In these groups, RTV 400 mg and SQVsgc 400 mg twice daily were given from days 4-18. A fourth group (arm 4) received NFV 1250 mg twice daily from days 1-14 with pravastatin 40 mg daily added from days 15-18. Statin and NFV levels were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Fifty-six subjects completed both pharmacokinetic study days. In arms 1-3, the median estimated area under the curves (AUC)(0-24) for the statins were: pravastatin (arm 1, n = 13), 151 and 75 ng.h/ml on days 4 and 18 (decline of 50% in presence of RTV/SQVsgc), respectively (P = 0.005); simvastatin (arm 2, n = 14), 17 and 548 ng.h/ml on days 4 and 18 (increase of 3059% in the presence of RTV/SQVsgc), respectively (P < 0.001); and total active atorvastatin (arm 3, n = 14), 167 and 289 ng.h/ml on days 4 and 18 (increase of 79% in the presence of RTV/SQVsgc), respectively (P < 0.001). In arm 4, the median estimated AUC(0-8) for NFV (24 319 versus 26 760 ng.h/ml; P = 0.58) and its active M8 metabolite (15 565 versus 14 571 ng.h/m; P = 0.63) were not statistically different from day 14 to day 18 (without or with pravastatin). Simvastatin should be avoided and atorvastatin may be used with caution in persons taking RTV and SQVsgc. Dose adjustment of pravastatin may be necessary with concomitant use of RTV and SQVsgc. Pravastatin does not alter the NFV pharmacokinetics, and thus appears to be safe for concomitant use.	methods aids clinical trials group actg study a5047 randomized phase i open label multiple dose

117	Pharmacokinetics and efficacy of fluvoxamine and amitriptyline in depression.	Although often necessary for obtaining remission following major depressive disorder, combined antidepressant treatment is frequently associated with drug interactions and enhanced adverse drug effects. We investigated pharmacokinetic interactions following combined fluvoxamine and amitriptyline treatment and their impact on therapeutic efficacy and tolerability. Twenty-two inpatients with major depression [Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) rating > or =18] were treated with either amitriptyline (75 mg/day), fluvoxamine (100 mg/day) or both. Blood samples, for determination of amitriptyline, its major metabolite nortritpyline, and fluvoxamine, were obtained after single dose administration and in steady-state. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated using HAM-D and adverse drug effects were evaluated using the clinical global impression scale. Following combined treatment, steady-state plasma levels of nortriptyline were significantly decreased compared to monotherapy. HAM-D scores after two-week treatment showed that there was a better response to combined treatment. There was no significant difference in severity of adverse effects among groups. We observed a pharmacokinetic interaction between fluvoxamine and amitritpyline resulting in impaired metabolism of the later. However, no significant impact of the interaction on treatment safety was observed. Moreover, concomitant use of amitriptyline at 75 mg/day and fluvoxamine at 100 mg/day was well tolerated with a more prompt and stronger onset of clinical response compared to monotherapy in patients with major depression.	materials methods study protocol the study protocol approved medical ethics board institute mental health ethical standards defined world medical association declaration helsinki met a total caucasian inpatients diagnosed major depression according dsm iv guideline participated study hamilton depression rating scale ham d used evaluation severity disease therapeutic efficacy ham d ratings performed psychiatrist adverse drug effects monitored rated accord ing clinical global impression cgi inclusion criteria ham d score prior treatment initiation exclusion psychiatric disorders normal function liver kidneys medication use previous four weeks patients informed detail study written consent obtained prior study enrollment patients randomised three groups the at group consisted nine patients received at mg day monotherapy on day at administered single oral dose mg overnight fast h prior food intake from day drug administered three times mg the fl group consisted six patients received fl mg day monotherapy on day fl administered morning whereas day dosage regimen mg evening the at fl group consisted seven patients received combined treatment at mg day fl mg day on day single doses at mg fl mg administered morning from day at administered three times day mg whereas fl administered evening mg there significant difference groups respect age weight sex baseline ham d score characteristics treatment summarized table clinical response attributed patients whose ham d rating compared baseline two weeks treatment initiation in fl at fl group ham d testing performed four weeks initiation treatment in at group ham d assesment performed six weeks initiation treatment remission achieved ham d score in order establish possible interaction at fl pharmacokinetic parameters determined plasma samples single dose steadystate following single dose samples obtained prior drug administration table patients characteristics treatment at group n fl group n agea weighta sex female male baseline ham da treatment at mg day fl mg day ham d hamilton depression rating scale mean value s d at fl group n at mg day fl mg day s vezmar et al h steady state plasma samples obtained 14th day treatment in at at fl groups samples obtained prior at administration morning afternoon evening well h morning afternoon dose in fl group samples obtained evening prior drug administration h later the difference sampling time following drug administration due inability sample collection night fl group actual sampling times three groups patients all samples collected heparinized vials furthermore vials containing samples at silanized order prevent glass adsorption drug immediately collection samples centrifugated kept 20 c analysis drug analysis samples analyzed at major metabolite nt fl at nt extracted solid phase plasma sample analyzed high performance liquid chromatography hplc ultraviolet uv detection according method miljkovic et al another extraction hplc uv method developed miljkovic et al used determination fl both methods met requirements according fda guideline bioanalytical method validation pharmacokinetic statistical analysis pharmacokinetic parameters calculated using winnonlin version pharsight mountain view ca usa statistics performed spsstm version spss inc chicago il usa due small sample size statistical evaluation performed using non parametric testing the level significance set p 0 05	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
118	Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of diltiazem in healthy males and females following a single oral dose.	Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of DTZ and its metabolites were determined in 20 healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females) after they had each been given a single oral 90 mg dose of DTZ. DTZ and six of its metabolites which included N-monodesmethyl DTZ (MA), deacetyl DTZ (M1), deacetyl N-monodesmethyl DTZ (M2), deacetyl O-desmethyl DTZ (M4) and deacetyl DTZ N-oxide (M1NO) and deacetyl N,O-didesmethyl DTZ (M6), were determined by a sensitive and specific HPLC assay. The major metabolites measurable in the plasma of all the volunteers were MA, M1, and M2. The terminal half-lives (t1/2) of M1 and M2 were considerably longer than those of DTZ and MA. Less than 5% of the dose was excreted as unchanged DTZ in the urine over the 24 h period. The major urinary metabolite was MA, followed by M6, M2, and then M1. Except for the urinary excretion of M4 there were no statistically significant differences in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters between the males and the females. The mean 24 h urinary recovery of M4 was higher in the males than in the females (P < 0.05). However there were large inter-individual variations in the plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of DTZ and its metabolites with some parameters differing by more than 20-fold. In addition, O-desmethyl DTZ (Mx) and N,O-didesmethyl DTZ (MB) were identified as two other major urinary metabolites.	materials and methods study design the study approved research review con mittee

119	Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam after oral and IV administration.	Six fasting male subjects (20-32 years of age) received an oral tablet and an IV 1.0-mg dose of alprazolam in a crossover-design study. Alprazolam plasma concentration in multiple samples during 36 h after dosing was determined by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. Psychomotor performance tests, digit-symbol substitution (DSS), and perceptual speed (PS) were administered at 0, 1.25, 2.25, 5.0, and 12.5 h. Sedation was assessed by the subjects and by an observer using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and a Nurse Rating Sedation Scale (NRSS), respectively. Mean kinetic parameters after IV and oral alprazolam were as follows: volume of distribution (Vd) 0.72 and 0.84 l/kg; elimination half-life (t1/2) 11.7 and 11.8 h; clearance (Cl) 0.74 and 0.89 ml/min/kg. There were no significant differences between IV and oral alprazolam in Vd, t1/2, or area under the curve. The mean fraction absorbed after oral administration was 0.92. Performance on PS and DSS tests was impaired at 1.25 and 2.5 h, but had returned to baseline at 5.0 h for both treatments. Onset of sedation was rapid after IV administration and the average time of peak sedation was 0.48 h. Sedation scores were significantly lower during hour 1 after oral administration than after IV, but were not significantly different at later times. Alprazolam is fully available after oral administration and kinetic parameters are not affected by route of administration. With the exception of rapidity of onset, the pharmacodynamic profiles of IV and oral alprazolam are very similar after a 1.0-mg dose.	materials methods six adult male volunteers gave written informed consent participate balanced crossover design study the study blinded placebo controlled all subjects normal physical examination biochemical screening profile subjects denied entry study history chronic disease taken medication days prior to study subjects also excluded history seizures allergic reaction benzodiazepines psychotic disorders major depressive illness all subjects nonsmokers consume two alcoholic drinks per day at approximately 7a m 12 h fast 1 0mg alprazolam administered either oral tablet ml ft oz water slow iv injection median cubital vein the iv drug mg ml propylene glycol water vehicle administered min arm opposite in dwelling catheter inserted venous blood sampling the dose followed 4 h fast subjects allowed water ad libitum fasting period allowed remain sedentary course study strenuous physical activity prohibited h following drug administration each study phase separated 1 week washout period blood samples ml collected prior alprazolam dose time min h dose plasma decanted frozen assayed psychomotor performance tests the night drug administration subjects familiarized psychomotor tests included perceptual speed ps digit cancellation digit symbol substitution dss the tests given order test time timed stop watch follows ps dss on study day different equivalent ps dss tests administered at 30 min h prior drug h postdrug at beginning test battery subjects asked rate degree alertness using stanford sleepiness scale table description scoring nurse rated sedation scores alert awake oriented quiet eyes dosed open alert questions command drowsy eyes closed open responds slowly command drowsy eyes closed sluggish response command alertness improves stimulation vocal physical drowsy eyes closed repeated verbal stimulation required response response sluggish necessarily oriented command stimulation asleep eyes closed may aroused open eyes loud verbal and or physical shaking response oriented time place person unarousable loud verbal physical shaking no evidence respiratory cardiovasctilar depression unarousable respiratory and or cardiovascular depression documentable _ alprazolam ling i v i i i i i time hours p fig mean alprazolam plasma concentrations nrss 1 0 rag single dose alprazolam administered iv injection oral tablet six normal male volunteers wide awake almost asleep hoddes et al in addition self assessment sedation scored nurse time blood sample the scores nurse rated sedation scale nrss ranged alert unarousable table provides list used observer making sleepiness assessment assay plasma samples assayed alprazolam concentration gas liquid chromatography glc using electron capture detection greenblatt et al table mean range pharmacokinetic nurse rated sedation score parameters oral iv administration mg alprazolam six subjects iv oral significance pharmacokinetics peak plasma concen23 7 tration ng ml time peak h elimination half life h ns auc ng h ml ns total clearance ns mt min kg volume distribution 1 kg ns fraction absorbed absorption half life min sedation score nrss time onset min p peak sedation score ns time peak sedation ns h pharmacokinetic statistical analysis plasma alprazolam concentration time data fitted sum two three exponentials using cstrip computer program uses linear regression method residuals curve fitting process sedman wagner the area plasma concentration curve auc calculated trapezoidal rule last time point measurable concentration the auc extrapolated infinity adding value last concentration divided apparent elimination rate constant alprazolam total plasma clearance c1 calculated dividing dose auc volume distribution vd calculated dividing c1 ft the fraction oral dose absorbed calculated dividing auc oral dose auc iv dose performance tests graded number correct responses the morning test time h used baseline value comparison subsequent tests to minimize intersubject variability performance tests h ex ressed percent change baseline score tested determine significant change occurred drug administration pharmacokinetic parameters sedation performance test scores analyzed differences treatments analysis variance	PK Trial	PK Trial	PK Trial	1	1	1
120	Pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and concomitant lithium and valproate.	The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of the antipsychotic aripiprazole when coadministered with lithium or valproate. Two open-label, sequential treatment design studies were conducted in chronically institutionalized patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder requiring treatment with lithium (n = 12) or valproate (divalproex sodium) (n = 10). Patients received aripiprazole 30 mg/day on days 1 to 14 and aripiprazole with concomitant therapy on days 15 to 36. Lithium was titrated from 900 mg until serum concentrations reached 1.0 to 1.4 mEq/L for at least 5 days. Valproate was titrated to 50 to 125 mg/L. Coadministration with lithium increased mean Cmax and AUC values of aripiprazole by about 19% and 15%, respectively, whereas the apparent oral clearance decreased by 15%. There was no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of aripiprazole. Coadministration with valproate decreased the AUC and Cmax of aripiprazole by 24% and 26%, respectively, with minimal effects on the active metabolite. Therapeutic doses of lithium and divalproex had no clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.	materials and methods two open-label, sequential treatment design studies were conducted at 3 state-operated psychiatric centers: rockland and bronx psychiatric centers in new york state and norristown state hospital in pennsylvania. the time period was april 2000 to march 2001. among the inclusion criteria were a dsm-iv diagno- sis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder that re- quired lithium or valproate for the management of symptoms, aged 18 to 55 years, and able to give in- formed consent and/or consent obtained from a legally acceptable representative (as required by the local in- vestigational review boards that approved the studies). excluded from both studies were subjects with a his- tory of recent (within 6 months) drug or alcohol abuse; a diagnosis of delirium, dementia, or amnestic or other cognitive disorders; presence of focal or epileptiform abnormalities in screening electroencephalogram (eeg); need for any concomitant medications that might potentially interfere with metabolism of aripiprazole, lithium, or valproate; positive hepatitis b surface antigen or hepatitis c antibody test at screen- ing; and evidence of organ dysfunction or any clini- cally significant deviation from normal in the physi- cal, electrocardiographic, or clinical laboratory examinations. the following tests and procedures were done at baseline and at regular intervals during the trial: physi- cal examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory, elec- trocardiogram (ecg), eeg, positive and negative syndrome scale (panss), mini-mental state exam (mmse), simpson-angus scale, barnes akathisia scale, and the abnormal involuntary movement scale. after a medication washout period, subjects on day 1 were administered aripiprazole 30 mg once daily (2 tablets of 15 mg) for the duration of the study. on day 14, serial blood samples were collected for the determi- nation of aripiprazole pharmacokinetics. beginning on day 15 and lasting for the next 21 days (days 15-36), lithium (lithium carbonate slow-release tablets) or valproate (divalproex sodium) was coadministered with aripiprazole. the lithium dose was titrated upward from a start- ing dose of 900 mg (in a once- or twice-daily regimen) until serum lithium concentrations approached the upper end of the lithium therapeutic concentration range (1.0-1.4 meq/l) and were maintained for at least 5 days or until dose-limiting adverse events were ob- served. for patients in the valproate study, the dose was titrated upward from a starting dose of 250 mg twice a day until a serum concentration of 50 to 125 mg/l was achieved or until dose-limiting adverse 90 Â¥ j clin pharmacol 2005;45:89-93 events were observed. after day 21, the dose of valproate was held constant for the following 2 weeks (days 22-36). on the final day of lithium or valproate and aripiprazole coadministration, serial blood sam- ples were collected for the determination of aripiprazole pharmacokinetics in the presence of therapeutic concentrations of lithium or valproate. pharmacokinetic sample collection was accom- plished by collecting venous blood at each of the fol- lowing time points (relative to aripiprazole administra- tion): 0 (prior to dosing), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours. trough concentrations (cmin) were determined from the day 14 and day 36 predose samples. pharmaco- kinetic measures for orally administered aripiprazole and its active metabolite, opc-14857, were derived from plasma concentration versus time data. the fol- lowing pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by study day (days 14 and 36): peak plasma concentra- tion (cmax), time to reach cmax (tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the dosing inter- val (auc_), and apparent oral clearance (clt/f). geo- metric means and coefficients of variation for cmax and auc on days 14 and 36, as well as corresponding ratios of day 36 values to day 14 values, were also deter- mined. medians and ranges were calculated for tmax. means, standard deviations, and ranges were calcu- lated for cmin and clt/f. assays for aripiprazole and metabolite concentra- tions and pharmacokinetic analyses were performed under the supervision of the bioanalytical group of the clinical discovery department at bristol-myers squibb. assays for lithium and valproate concentra- tions were performed using standard commercial methods by duly licensed laboratories.

121	Pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its metabolites in cigarette smokers versus nonsmokers.	Bupropion is an antidepressant agent that is also effective as an aid to quit cigarette smoking. A single 150-mg tablet of sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride was administered to two groups of volunteers, cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, who were matched for race, gender, body frame, age, and weight. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for bupropion, and three major metabolites (hydroxybupropion and the aminoalcohol isomers, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, expressed as a composite total). Mean (+/-SD) values of area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-infinity), maximum concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (tmax), and half-life (t1/2) of bupropion in smokers and nonsmokers, respectively, were 1,164 +/- 220 ng.hr/mL and 1,161 +/- 292 ng.hr/mL; 144 +/- 28 ng/mL and 143 +/- 39 ng/mL; 3.00 +/- 0.50 hours and 2.88 +/- 0.49 hours; and 19 +/- 5 hours and 18 +/- 3 hours. No clinically significant differences between smokers and nonsmokers or between male and female volunteers were observed for the pharmacokinetics of bupropion or its metabolites. The absence of pharmacokinetic differences indicates that dosage adjustments are not necessary when bupropion is prescribed to male and female cigarette smokers.	methods subjects safety termine ics

122	Pharmacokinetics of chlorpromazine and key metabolites.	A study was carried out in 11 healthy young men to investigate the pharmacokinetics of chlorpromazine (CPZ) after a bolus intravenous (i.v.) dose (10 mg) and three single oral doses (25, 50 and 100 mg), with a washout period of two weeks between doses. Plasma levels of CPZ, CPZ N-oxide (CPZNO), CPZ sulfoxide (CPZSO) and both free and conjugated 7-hydroxy-CPZ (7-HOCPZ) were measured by extraction radioimmunoassays. CPZ exhibited multicompartmental pharmacokinetics in most subjects. There was wide between-subject variability in half life (11.05 h), volume of distribution (1215 l), volume of distribution at steady state (642 l) and mean residence time (8.88 h), whereas systemic clearance was somewhat less variable (76.6 l.h-1). All metabolites were present in measurable concentrations in the plasma of 9 of 11 subjects after i.v. CPZ, whereas free 7-HOCPZ was not detected in the other 2 individuals. With the exception of CPZNO, the biological half lives of the primary metabolites were longer than the half life of CPZ. After oral administration, the percentage of CPZ reaching the systemic circulation intact (F%) was very low (4-38%) and dose dependent. Moreover, both within-subject and between-subject variances were very high. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinite time (AUC) showed evidence of nonlinearity, whereas half life did not appear to be dose dependent. These data suggest that the high degree of variability in the pharmacokinetics of CPZ is a result of extensive first pass metabolism rather than variation in half life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	methods protocol a cohort healthy young men aged years weighing kg screened assessment health history physical examination standard laboratory tests of individuals passed medical screening completed study giving written informed consent each volunteer given iv dose mg cpz largactil injectable single oral doses mg mg mg cpz largactil liquid rhone poulenc ltd montreal quebec canada 2 week washout period dose the cpz syrup met usp xx specifications contained decomposition products determined hplc method close medical supervision royal university hospital saskatoon provided volunteers hours administration either iv dose mg oral dose in order minimize portion study hospital mg mg oral doses randomized all doses administered overnight fast food allowed h dosing each oral dose given together ml water blood samples collected median cubital vein heparinized evacuated glass tubes contact blood rubber stopper dosing h dose the plasma separated immediately stored c plastic scintillation vials fisher scientific ltd canada analysis stability cpz metabolites storage in order evaluate adequacy storage conditions control plasma samples spiked separately cpz cpzso hocpz cpzno ng ml the stability control samples divided aliquots stored plastic scintillation vials alongside test samples c aliquots stability control sample analyzed bimonthly intervals eight month period storage plasma sample analysis extraction ria procedures cpz cpz80 cpzno 7 hocpz used monitor appropriate analyte plasma the assays validated comparison hplc in order estimate plasma levels free 7 hocpz total conjugates 7 hocpz ria analyses 7 hocpz carried hydrolysis crude fl glucuronidase preparation containing sulfatases glusulase sigma chem co st louis mo usa pharmacokinetics statistics basic pharmacokinetic parameters clearance cl volume distribution v volume distribution steady state v mean residence time mrt calculated established methods the elimination rate constant elimination half life tl 2 mrt primary metabolite calculated statistical moment method chan the corresponding half life calculated terminal slope natural log plasma concentration versus time curve denoted tl 2 k analysis variance anova took account dose phase sequence nested subject effects carried pc sas raw data respective natural logs the student neuman keuls snk multiple comparison test performed required following anova statistical significance set c within subject variability f cpz oral dosing estimated positive square root error term anova natural log transformed values	PK Trial	PK Trial	PK Trial	1	1	1
123	Pharmacokinetics of desipramine HCl when administered with cinacalcet HCl.	In vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 2D6. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity, using desipramine as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects. Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine (50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet (90 mg for 7 days). Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose. Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms. Relative to desipramine alone, mean AUC and C(max) of desipramine increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with cinacalcet. The t (1/2,z) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet (21.0 versus 43.3 hs). The t (max) was similar between the regimens. Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet. This study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet, dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6.	methods study design treatment a outpatient visits days morning day treatment b on day treatment a day treatment b blood samples determination plasma desipramine concentrations collected sodium heparinized tubes predose h postdose physical exams ecgs conducted blood samples complete blood count blood chemistries collected screening conclusion study vital signs adverse event reporting conducted daily treatment periods pharmacokinetics two period two sequence crossover this phase randomized open label single center twotreatment study enrolled healthy subjects ages years the study conducted accordance good clinical practice guidelines institutional review board approval written informed consent subjects prior study participation subjects required cyp2d6 extensive metabolizers determined genotyping genaissance pharmaceuticals new haven ct usa normal clinical laboratory tests complete blood count blood chemistries normal physical exam electrocardiogram ecg negative urine alcohol drug screen subjects ineligible history evidence clinically significant medical disease condition e g seizure disorder cardiac arrhythmia drug alcohol abuse hepatitis b surface antigens hepatitis c human immunodeficiency virus antibodies subjects excluded tobacco use participation another investigational study within days medication use including over the counter exception acetaminophen herbal products within days dosing all aforesaid medications prohibited study unless approved investigator subjects also excluded unwilling use adequate contraception women pregnant lactating condition would impede study treatment procedures subjects randomized ratio receive single mg dose desipramine alone treatment a 7 day course cinacalcet mg treatment b first period based computer generated randomization schedule prepared amgen inc using sas after washout period least days subjects received treatment period for treatment a subjects administered single oral dose desipramine day following 10 h fast for treatment b subjects received cinacalcet days breakfast desipramine morning day following 10 h fast subjects remained research facility day plasma concentrations desipramine determined liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms lower limit quantitation loq ng ml mds pharma services lincoln ne usa desipramine plasma concentration time data analyzed noncompartmental methods using winnonlin professional v pharsight corporation mountain view ca usa plotted semi log scale the data points described log linear terminal phase identified the terminal phase rate constant z estimated using linear logtransformed terminal data points versus time terminal half life t1 2 z calculated 0 693 z the area concentration time curve time last measurable concentration auc0 t calculated linear trapezoidal rule the area concentrationtime curve time last measurable concentration infinity auct 1 calculated dividing concentration last measurable plasma concentration z auc0 1 calculated summation auc0 t auct 1 oral clearance cl f calculated dose auc0 1 regression concentration values desipramine loq set zero calculations concentration data pharmacokinetic parameters summarized using descriptive statistics auc cmax analyzed using crossover analysis variance anova model the subject subject within sequence period treatment effects extracted auc cmax transformed natural logarithms analysis all summary statistics based original scale data for auc cmax point estimates confidence intervals ci constructed ratio desipramine cinacalcet desipramine alone using residual variance anova expressed percentage absence interaction concluded cis safety the safety profile characterized using adverse events vital signs clinical laboratory measurements ecgs physical examinations subjects received least one dose either study drug adverse events summarized frequency type group i e desipramine alone desipramine cinacalcet	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
124	Pharmacokinetics of diltiazem after intravenous and oral administration.	The kinetic profile of diltiazem, a novel calcium antagonist, was studied in 12 volunteers following oral (60 mg) and intravenous (15 mg) administration. After i.v. administration biphasic elimination was observed, with a distribution half-life of 0.3 +/- 0.2 h and an elimination half-life of 3.1 +/- 1.0 h; the apparent volume of distribution was 5.3 +/- 1.71/kg and the total clearance was 1.28 +/- 0.48 l/kg/h. After the oral dose the elimination had a half-life of 3.2 +/- 1.3 h. The absolute bioavailability of diltiazem ranged from 24 to 74% (mean 42 +/- 18%). The interindividual variation may be explained by a variable first pass effect.	material methods observations made fully informed volunteers aged years each subject received according randomized design oral diltiazem mg one tablet slow min intravenous infusion mg an interval week elapsed administration preparations venous blood samples collected h following oral administration min h intravenous dose the samples immediately centrifuged plasma separated kept c assayed drug analysis plasma samples analysed diltiazem odeacetyldiltiazem gas chromatography using perkin elmer sigma gas chromatograph fitted nitrogen specific detector previously described pharmacokinetics analysis the pharmacokinetics analysed using interactive graphic program igpharm hp computer the time concentration data points fitted multiexponential equation using either peeling method gauss newton interactive procedure ph hermann et al kinetics diltiazem table mean diltiazem concentration plasma ng ml slow min intravenous infusion mg mg oral dose time lh 2h 3h 4h 5h 6h 8h 10h 12h i v mean _ sd range p o mean _ sd range perfusion ended the areas time concentration curves auc calculated trapezoidal rule extrapolation infinity using terminal slope subject t fl auc vd clearance fitted curve h ng ml h 1 kg 1 h kg the volume distribution vdb computed p b vd dose total body clearance tbc1 s c auc fl g j obtained formula j k dosef m l o 87 c1 n l auc eo m p apparent plasma half lives calculated j l t m t m w fl s w the fraction bioavailable systemic circulaa w tion calculated according formula mean f dose iv x auc po sd dose pox auc iv the absorption lag time computed taking intersection theoretical curve time axis	PK Trial	PK Trial	PK Trial	1	1	1
125	Pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its metabolites in relation to CYP2D6 genotype.	Recently, it was shown in vitro that the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 mediates O-demethylation of diltiazem. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its major metabolites in healthy human volunteers representing different CYP2D6 genotypes. Norwegians of Caucasian origin were screened for their CYP2D6 genotype on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) by melting-curve analysis of allele-specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes hybridized to polymerase chain reaction-amplified deoxyribonucleic acid. The first 5 individuals identified with genotypes corresponding to a homozygous extensive, heterozygous extensive, or homozygous poor CYP2D6-metabolizing phenotype, respectively, were voluntarily enrolled in the pharmacokinetic study. The participants received diltiazem, 120 mg, as a single oral dose, and plasma samples were collected up to 24 hours after administration. Plasma samples were purified by solid phase extraction. Diltiazem and 7 phase I metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem was not significantly different between the subgroups. However, the systemic exposure of the pharmacologically active metabolites desacetyl diltiazem and N-demethyldesacetyl diltiazem was > or = 5 times higher in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers than in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (P <.01). CYP2D6 activity does not have a major impact on the disposition of diltiazem. In contrast, desacetyl diltiazem and N-demethyldesacetyl diltiazem are markedly accumulated in individuals expressing a deficient CYP2D6 phenotype. Because these metabolites exhibit pharmacologic properties of possible importance, individual CYP2D6 activity might be an aspect to consider in the clinical use of diltiazem.	methods subjects before

126	Pharmacokinetics of mirtazapine and lithium in healthy male subjects.	A substantial proportion of patients diagnosed with depression and treated with antidepressants show no or insufficient response. In such patients, lithium is often added to the antidepressant for augmentation. The present study investigated the possible drug-drug interaction between mirtazapine and lithium in 12 healthy male subjects in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-period cross-over design. Subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of two groups. After an overnight fast, they received either a single oral dose of 600 mg lithium carbonate (16 meq Li+) for 10 days at 08.00 h and a single oral dose of 30 mg mirtazapine at 21.00 h on day 9 or the same number (n = 4) of placebo capsules and and a single oral dose of 30 mg mirtazapine at 21.00 h on day 9. At pre-defined times, blood samples were drawn for the measurement of mirtazapine plasma concentrations and lithium serum concentrations. In addition, psychometric tests were performed and the safety and tolerability of the drugs were assessed. The results indicate that mirtazapine does not alter the pharmacokinetics of lithium and vice versa. In addition, the combination of mirtazapine and lithium appeared to be safe and well-tolerated. Extensive psychometric testing after the administration of mirtazapine did not reveal any differences on any tests in subjects on lithium and placebo, respectively.	methods materials after approval

127	Pharmacokinetics of sertraline in relation to genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19.	Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between the disposition of sertraline and the presence of the CYP2C19 gene and to define the contribution of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to sertraline N-demethylation. A single oral 100-mg dose of sertraline was administered to 6 subjects who were extensive metabolizers and 6 subjects who were poor metabolizers recruited from 77 healthy Chinese volunteers whose genotypes were predetermined by polymerase chain reaction-based amplification, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Phenotypes were determined by use of the omeprazole metabolic rate. The plasma concentrations of sertraline and desmethylsertraline were determined by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. Six poor metabolizers with m1 mutation had area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) values (983.6 +/- 199.3 microg x h/L versus 697.6 +/- 133.0 microg x h/L; P <.05) and terminal elimination half-life values of sertraline (35.5 +/- 5.6 hours versus 23.5 +/- 4.4 hours; P <.01) that were significantly higher than the values in 6 extensive metabolizers who were either homozygous or heterozygous for CYP2C19*1. The oral clearance of sertraline in poor metabolizers (105.3 +/- 19.4 L/h) was significantly lower than that of extensive metabolizers (148.4 +/- 28.6 L/h). The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 144 hours and the maximum plasma concentration of desmethylsertraline in poor metabolizers were significantly lower than the values of extensive metabolizers (627.6 +/- 203.8 microg x h/L versus 972.1 +/- 270.3 microg x h/L; P <.05; and 23.6 +/- 6.5 nmol/L versus 32.4 +/- 8.2 nmol/L; P <.01; respectively). The polymorphic CYP2C19 appears to be a major enzyme involved in the N-demethylation of sertraline, and both extensive and poor metabolizers had marked differences in the disposition of sertraline.	methods subjects before full pharmacokinetic study sertraline unrelated healthy chinese volunteers screened cyp2c19 genotypes six extensive metabolizers genotyped cyp2c19 1 1 cyp2c19 1 2 cyp2c19 1 cyp2c 3 poor metabolizers genotyped cyp2c19 2 2 cyp2c19 2 3 randomly selected participation study the mean age years range years mean body weight kg range kg all subjects male nonsmokers healthy determined medical history physical examination laboratory screening tests no medication ethanol consumption allowed least weeks clinical study the ethics committees hunan medical university approved study written informed consent obtained subjects determination cyp2c19 genotypes phenotypes all subjects belonged pool volunteers predetermined cyp2c19 genotypes cyp2c19 2 m1 cyp2c19 3 m2 mutations determined conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction 7 8 cyp2c19 phenotypes determined use omeprazole probe drug 14 in brief subjects whose genotypes known given single oral 20 mg dose omeprazole astra pharmaceutical production ab s dert lje sweden the concentrations omeprazole 5 hydroxymetabolite measured plasma hours oral administration omeprazole log omeprazole hydroxylation indices log10 omeprazole 5 hydroxyomeprazole calculated an index log10 metabolic ratio taken correspond extensive metabolizer phenotype whereas index corresponded poor metabolizer phenotype collection samples after overnight fast subjects received single oral dose mg sertraline pfizer co dalian china ml water subjects allowed receive food drink hours drug administration then 8 ml venous blood samples collected heparinized tubes immediately hours hours administration drug plasma obtained kept frozen 20 c analyzed plasma sertraline desmethylsertraline assay the plasma concentrations sertraline desmethylsertraline determined minor modified gas chromatography electron capture detection 15 one step extraction used study diazepam used internal standard in brief added ml diazepam mol l ml plasma samples contained sertraline desmethylsertraline adjusted solution ph sodium hydroxide mol l extracted diethylether hexane vol vol the organ phase transferred another clean glass tube evaporated volume l room temperature subsequently derivatives formed l trifluoroacetic anhydride diethylether hexane residues dissolved l ethyl acetate injected gas chromato wang et al clinical pharmacology therapeutics july table i results genotypes phenotypes cyp2c19 chinese subjects log10 subject no genotype cyp2c19 1 1 cyp2c19 2 2 cyp2c19 2 2 cyp2c19 1 3 cyp2c19 1 1 cyp2c19 1 1 cyp2c19 2 2 cyp2c19 1 2 cyp2c19 1 2 cyp2c19 2 3 cyp2c19 2 2 cyp2c19 2 2 omeprazole 5 hydroxyomeprazole index phenotype em pm pm em em em pm em em pm pm pm em extensive metabolizers pm poor metabolizers graph equipped electron capture detector chromatography performed phenylmethylsilicone capillary column mm inner diameter alltech dalian china the limit detection sertraline desmethylsertraline nmol l a good linear relationship obtained range nmol l sertraline nmol l desmethylsertraline the coefficient variation intraday interday reproducibility ranged sertraline desmethylsertraline respectively data analysis pharmacokinetic analysis performed noncompartmental approach the area concentration versus time curve auc0 t calculated trapezoidal rule zero last measured concentration point the elimination rate constant ke sertraline estimated least regression analysis the area concentration versus time curve zero hour infinity auc0 oral clearance cloral sertraline calculated following equations auc0 auc0 t ct ke cl dose auc0 c drug concentration plasma cl total body clearance drug plasma the data analyzed student test 1way anova the minimal statistical level significance accepted p the statistical program sas sas institute inc cary nc used analysis	PK Trial	Special PK Trial	Genotyped PK Trial	1	3	5
128	Pharmacokinetics of the novel antipsychotic agent risperidone and the prolactin response in healthy subjects.	The pharmacokinetics of a novel antipsychotic agent, risperidone, and the prolactin response were studied in 12 dextromethorphan-phenotyped healthy men after administration of 1 mg risperidone intravenously, intramuscularly, and orally. The formation of the equipotent major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, exhibited CYP2D6-related polymorphism. The plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity ratio of 9-hydroxyrisperidone to risperidone averaged 3 (intravenous and intramuscular) and 6 (oral administration) in the extensive metabolizers and 0.2 in the poor metabolizers. Risperidone half-life was about 3 hours in extensive metabolizers and 22 hours in poor metabolizers. Risperidone absolute oral bioavailability was 66%. The pharmacokinetics of the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) varied little among subjects (mean terminal half-life, 20 +/- 2 1/2 hours; absolute oral and intramuscular bioavailability, 100%). The prolactin response correlated best with the plasma active moiety, which showed little hysteresis. It is concluded that risperidone metabolic polymorphism on increased plasma prolactin is minimal and that the active moiety is clinically relevant.	methods subjects treatment plan twelve healthy male

129	Pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of aripiprazole following multiple oral dosing in normal healthy volunteers.	Two 14-day, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies evaluated the fasting pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole, a new antipsychotic, in healthy male subjects. In Study 1, 37 subjects were randomized to aripiprazole 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, or placebo once daily. In Study 2, 11 subjects were randomized to aripiprazole, titrated from 10 to 30 mg/day, or placebo. Aripiprazole had linear pharmacokinetics over 5 to 30 mg/day, which were described by a two-compartment open model, with first-order absorption. In Study 1, mean elimination half-life ranged from 47 to 68 hours with aripiprazole, with apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) of approximately 3.45 L/h. In Study 2, mean elimination half-life was 59 hours (CL/F approximately 4.0 L/h). Adverse events were generally mild to moderate, were transient in nature, and commonly occurred within the first 3 days of dosing. Clinical laboratory assessments, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and prolactin levels showed no clinically significant changes during the studies.	participants and methods both studies

130	Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of desloratadine and fluoxetine in healthy volunteers.	The authors assessed the potential for a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction between desloratadine and fluoxetine. This randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label study was conducted in 54 healthy volunteers. Subjects received 1 of 3 treatments: desloratadine 5 mg plus fluoxetine 20 mg, desloratadine 5 mg plus placebo, or fluoxetine 20 mg plus placebo. Serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed at baseline and day 35. Treatment effects on C(max) and AUC were assessed. During coadministration of desloratadine with fluoxetine, the ratio of the mean log-transformed C(max) and AUC values for desloratadine following concomitant fluoxetine therapy revealed a small increase in C(max) values of 15% (90% confidence interval [CI], 95%-139%) but no increase for AUC values (90% CI, 82%-123%). Corresponding values for 3-OH desloratadine demonstrated small increases in mean log-transformed C(max) and AUC ratios: 17% (90% CI, 100%-136%) and 13% (90% CI, 96%-132%), respectively. Statistical evaluation of the ratio of the mean C(max) and AUC values for fluoxetine following concomitant desloratadine therapy revealed small decreases of 9% (90% CI, 72%-115%) and 11% (90% CI, 69%-113%), respectively. Corresponding values for norfluoxetine demonstrated modest increases in mean log-transformed C(max) and AUC ratios: 22% (90% CI, 100%-139%) and 18% (90% CI, 101%-136%), respectively. Coadministration of desloratadine with a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 did not result in clinically relevant changes in its pharmacokinetic parameters. Desloratadine administration was not associated with clinically important changes in the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine, a drug metabolized by CYP2D6. The most common adverse event in all groups was headache (65%). Desloratadine plus fluoxetine caused no significant changes in ECGs or ventricular rate.	method study design population this randomized multiple dose parallel group placebo controlled open label study

131	Plasma concentrations of clozapine and its major metabolites during combined treatment with paroxetine or sertraline.	The effect of paroxetine or sertraline on steady-state plasma concentrations of clozapine and its major metabolites was studied in 17 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder stabilized on clozapine therapy (200-400 mg/day). In order to treat negative symptomatology or concomitant depression, 9 patients received additional paroxetine (20-40mg/day) and 8 patients sertraline (50-100 mg/day). After 3 weeks of paroxetine administration, mean plasma concentrations of clozapine and norclozapine increased significantly by 31% (p<0.01) and by 20% (p<0.05), respectively, while levels of clozapine N-oxide remained almost unchanged. The mean plasma norclozapine/clozapine and clozapine N-oxide/clozapine ratios were not modified during paroxetine treatment. No significant changes in plasma concentrations of clozapine and its major metabolites were observed after 3 weeks of combined therapy with sertraline. Clozapine coadministration with either paroxetine or sertraline was well tolerated. Our findings suggest that the metabolism of clozapine is not affected by sertraline treatment at typical therapeutic doses, while paroxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, appears to inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, possibly by affecting pathways other than N-demethylation and N-oxidation. While sertraline may be added safely to patients on maintenance treatment with clozapine, careful clinical observation and monitoring of plasma clozapine levels may be useful whenever paroxetine is coadministered with clozapine.	patients and methodsseventeen outpatients were selected for the study. the groupconsisted of 11 males and 6 females, aged 29 to 55 years, with adsm iv diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 13) or schizoaffectivedisorder, depressive type (n = 4), and were stabilized onclozapine therapy but required treatment with an ssri. theywere followed up at centers of mental health, azienda usl 5,messina. the study protocol was approved by the local ethicscommittee, and the patients or their relatives gave informedconsent for participation in the study. all patients had beentreated with clozapine for at least 3 months without changes in dosage over the previous month. in order to treat negativesymptoms and/or concomitant depression, 9 patients receivedadjunctive paroxetine at a dose of 20 to 40 mg/day and 8patients were given sertraline at a dose of 50 to 100 mg/day.both paroxetine and sertraline were administered orally once(in the morning) or twice daily, and their dose was keptconstant over the study period. the dosage and frequency ofclozapine administration (two or three times daily) were alsomaintained constant throughout the study. concomitanttreatment with other medications, when present, also remainedunchanged. none of the patients received compoundsknown to act as inhibitors or inducers of clozapine metabolism[13]. the study was designed as an open pharmacokineticinvestigation, and observation was limited to the first 3 weeksof coadministration of clozapine with paroxetine or sertraline.blood samples for pharmacokinetic determination were takenat 8:00 a.m. before the ssri and neuroleptic morning dose ontwo consecutive days during the week before starting treatmentwith paroxetine or sertraline (baseline values) and on twoconsecutive days at the end of week 3. the mean of the tworesultswas used for statistical evaluation. plasmawas collectedafter centrifugation and kept frozen at Â±208c until assay.steady-state plasma concentrations of clozapine, norclozapineand clozapine n-oxide were assayed by hplc according toavenoso et al. [3]. the sensitivity of the assay was 5 ng/ml forclozapine and norclozapine and 10 ng/ml for clozapine n-oxide.as a measure of compliance, plasma concentrations ofparoxetine and sertraline were estimated at week 3 using thehplc method by gupta [17] and gupta and dziurdzy [18],respectively.besides drug-monitoring, clinical side effects observed undercombination treatment were recorded by a senior psychiatrist.due to the uncontrolled design and the small and heterogeneoussample, the clinical efficacy of the drug combinationwas not evaluated.plasma concentrations of clozapine and its metabolites beforeand during treatment with paroxetine or sertraline werecompared using student s t-test for paired values. changes inthe clozapine metabolites/clozapine ratio in plasma before andduring coadministration of paroxetine or sertraline wereassessed using the wilcoxon signed-rank test. the student st-test for unpaired data was used to compare differencebetween paroxetine and sertraline-induced modifications inplasma levels of clozapine and its metabolites. the spearmanrank-correlation coefficient was used to correlate plasmaconcentrations of paroxetine or sertraline and percentagechange in plasma clozapine levels (week 3 vs. baseline). avalue of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant	DDI Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	0	2	2
132	Plasma levels of thioridazine and metabolites are influenced by the debrisoquin hydroxylation phenotype.	The pharmacokinetics of thioridazine and its metabolites were studied in 19 healthy male subjects: 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin. The subjects received a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine, and blood samples were collected during 48 hours. Concentrations of thioridazine and metabolites in serum were measured by HPLC. Slow hydroxylators of debrisoquin obtained higher serum levels of thioridazine with a 2.4-fold higher Cmax and a 4.5-fold larger AUC(0-infinity) associated with a twofold longer half-life compared with that of rapid hydroxylators. The side-chain sulphoxide (mesoridazine) and sulphone (sulphoridazine), which are active metabolites, appeared more slowly in serum and had lower Cmax values, but comparable AUC. The thioridazine ring-sulphoxide attained higher Cmax and 3.3-fold higher AUC in slow hydroxylators than in rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin. Thus the formation of mesoridazine from thioridazine and the 4-hydroxylation of debrisoquin seem to be catalyzed by the same enzyme, whereas the formation of thioridazine ring-sulphoxide is probably formed mainly by another enzyme.	the study performed open fashion use phenotyped panel design rapid slow hydroxylators debrisoquin 18 the volunteers informed aim trial gave consent participate the study performed according helsinki declaration approved local ethics committee huddinge hospital huddinge sweden nineteen nonobese healthy male volunteers age range years participated the debrisoquin hydroxylation phenotype subject investigated described mahgoub et al each subject received mg debrisoquin tablet declinax hoffmann laroche urine collected hours analyzed debrisoquin 4 hydroxydebrisoquin gas chromatography 19 six subjects mean age s131 years weight kg slow hydroxylators debrisoquin debrisoquin 4 hydroxydebrisoquin ratio 8 hour urine mg debrisoquin ratios thirteen rapid hydroxylators age years ch ch2 2 thioridazine other metabolic pathways fig metabolic pathways thioridazine ch3 ch2 2 oi nch3 _ mesoridazine s i ch3 c h nch3 sulphoridazine weight kg metabolic ratios served control subjects the volunteers received mg thioridazine tablet mallorol sandoz ag switzerland together ml water overnight fast no intake coffee tea allowed mornings test days a standardized light meal served hours drug intake no drugs alcohol allowed hours experiment before drug intake minutes hours drug intake blood samples ml drawn venoject tubes mediplast ab solna sweden without anticoagulants serum collected adverse events reported open questioning observed investigator hours dose recorded spontaneously reported symptoms times also recorded the serum concentrations thioridazine mesoridazine sulphoridazine ring sulphoxide measured modification hplc method mckay et al 2 briefly triethylperazine used internal standard the serum samples extracted mixture isoamylalcohol n hexane the evaporated extracts dissolved p 1 mobile phase washed p 1 n hexane a brownlee spheri phenyl column x mm brownlee labs inc santa clara calif used the mobile phase mixture acetonitrile tetrahydrofurane mol l phosphate buffer ph 1 1 l dimethyloctylamine added phase modifier the area serum concentrationtime curve auc estimated trapezoidal rule the total area 1auc 0 00 1 estimated extrapolation infinity adding term cpr cpri calculated concentration last sampling time xn slope terminal elimination phase the apparent half life values t 2 estimated terminal apparently linear part semilogarithmic serum drug concentration versus time curve for subjects pharmacokinetic variables differences slow rapid hydroxylators debrisoquin analyzed use mann whitney test twotailed	PK Trial	Special PK Trial	Phenotyped PK Trial	1	3	3
133	Prasugrel, a new thienopyridine antiplatelet drug, weakly inhibits cytochrome P450 2B6 in humans.	Prasugrel, a thienopyridine prodrug, is hydrolyzed in vivo by esterases to a thiolactone followed by a single cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent step to an active metabolite that is a potent inhibitor of adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation. This open-label, multiple-dose, 2-period, fixed-sequence study assessed CYP2B6 inhibition by prasugrel using bupropion as a probe substrate, where its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion, is almost exclusively formed by CYP2B6. Thirty healthy subjects received a single 150-mg oral dose of sustained-release bupropion. After a 7-day washout, a 60-mg prasugrel loading dose, followed by a 10-mg daily maintenance dose for 10 days, was administered. Bupropion (150 mg) was given with prasugrel on day 7 of this phase. Prasugrel weakly inhibited CYP2B6 activity as it increased bupropion Cmax and AUC0-infinity by 14% and 18%, respectively, and decreased hydroxybupropion Cmax and AUC0-infinity by 32% and 23%. These results are consistent with patients receiving prasugrel not requiring dose adjustments when treated with drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2B6.	methods site this was a single-center, open-label, 2-period, fixed- sequence study conducted between july 7, 2005, and october 26, 2005, at hammersmith medicines research central middlesex hospital, london, uk.a the study protocol was reviewed and approved by ravenscourt ethics committee, london, uk. the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and is consistent with applicable guidelines for good clinical practice. all subjects provided written informed consent. subjects enrollment was open to subjects between the ages of 18 and 60 years and with a body mass index (bmi) between 19 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive. thirty-two healthy men were enrolled. two subjects were with- drawn after receiving a dose of bupropion: one for fail- ing to disclose a preexisting condition at screening and the other due to a positive drug of abuse screen on admission to the second treatment period. neither of these subjects was replaced or included in the analy- sis. the 30 subjects who completed the study were 18 to 53 (mean Â± sd: 29 Â± 8) years of age with a bmi from 20 to 30 (mean Â± sd: 24 Â± 2) kg/m2 and weighing between 56 and 96 kg (mean Â± sd: 75 Â± 8 kg). the subjects were predominantly of caucasian origin (24), with 2 of african descent and 4 classified as mixed race. genotyping for cyp2b6 was not performed. for all subjects, all prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal medications were disallowed from 14 days prior to study entry. the screen for drugs of abuse included testing for amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol. all subjects were nonsmokers or had not smoked or used nicotine substitutes within 4 months before the study. the subjects had a carbon monoxide breath test prior to study entry. the a. lilly study code taas. drug interactions subjects were not allowed to consume fresh grape- fruit or drink grapefruit juice within 14 days of the study start through to discharge from the study. the subjects also were not allowed to consume caf- feinated beverages while resident in the clinical research unit (the day prior to dosing through to 48 hours after dosing), whereas outside the clinical research unit (48-120 hours postdose), they were requested to keep to their normal intake. rationale for the sample size thirty-two healthy subjects were enrolled to ensure that at least 28 subjects would complete study. this sample size was calculated to provide approximately 90% certainty of claiming lack of prasugrelÃs effect on bupropion if the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the geometric means between the test and reference treatments was contained within the predefined no- effect boundary of 0.80 to 1.25 for hydroxybupropion. this assumed a true ratio of 1 between prasugrel + bupropion and bupropion, as well as a within-subject variability (coefficient of variation [cv]) of 25% for the auc of hydroxybupropion.22 a total of 28 subjects completing the study also provided at least 90% power to detect a 15% decrease in hydroxybupropion when given with prasugrel at a 1-sided _ of .05 level of significance. study design subjects were admitted to the unit and received a single oral dose of 150 mg sustained-release bupro- pion 2 days later. all subjects were dosed after an overnight fast, and then 2 hours after dosing, a stan- dardized meal was provided to all. serial blood samples were collected for 120 hours postdose to determine plasma concentrations of bupropion and its cyp2b6-catalysed metabolite, hydroxybupropion. subjects were discharged 2 days after the bupropion dose and returned to the unit on an outpatient basis daily on the next 3 days for blood sampling. following a washout period of at least 7 days, the subjects were readmitted to the unit. a single oral loading dose of 60 mg prasugrel was given 2 days later followed by 10 daily oral mainte- nance doses of 10 mg prasugrel to ensure attainment of pharmacodynamic steady state. a single dose of 150 mg bupropion was administered with the sixth 10-mg prasugrel dose (day 7), after which serial blood samples were collected for the assay of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. the subjects were discharged 55 farid et al from the unit 2 days after the bupropion dose. the subjects returned to the unit on an outpatient basis for blood sampling and 10-mg prasugrel dosing on each of the next 2 days. analytical methods concentrations of bupropion and hydroxybupropion in plasma were determined using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (lc/ms/ms) method.b following liquid/ liquid extraction from plasma with hexanes, the ana- lytes and the internal standard were chromatographed on a zorbax sb c18 column (50 _ 4.6 mm, 5 _m) using ammonium formate ph 4.0/methanol flowing at 1 ml/minute as the mobile phase. mass spectral analy- sis was achieved on an mds sciex api4000 tandem mass spectrometer with a turboionspray interface in the positive ion mode. the ions were detected using the transitions m/z 240.2 to 184.2 for bupropion, m/z 256.2 to 238.2 for hydroxybupropion, and m/z 251.2 to 169.1 for d9-hydrobupropion, the internal standard. the assay lower limit of quantitation was 1 ng/ml for both bupropion and hydroxybupropion. the interassay precision and accuracy for the determina- tion of bupropion ranged from 3.04% to 3.81% and Ã0.71% to 3.12%, respectively, and ranged from 1.63% to 5.05% and Ã2.14 and 0.83, respectively, for hydroxybupropion. pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for bupropion and hydroxybupropion were calculated using non- compartmental methods of analysis using winnonlin (pharsight, cary, north carolina). log-transformed auc0-tlast, auc0-Â°, and cmax for bupropion and hydrox- ybupropion were analyzed using a linear mixed-effect model with Ãproc mixedÃ in sas (version 8.2). in this model, treatment was fitted as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. random subject in this model made each subject serve as his or her own con- trol to calculate the ratios of the geometric means between the 2 treatments, with a 90% confidence interval (ci) calculated to test the pharmacokinetic interaction. the parameter tmax was analyzed nonpara- metrically using the wilcoxon signed-rank test. chemistry, and urinalysis]) were conducted through- out the study at predetermined intervals. changes in safety assessment parameters were assigned signifi- cance based on validated normal reference ranges. changes in physical examination findings and adverse events collected during the study were assigned sig- nificance based on the medical judgment of the clin- ical investigator at the clinical unit. adverse events were classified according to severity (mild, moder- ate, or severe) and relatedness to treatment as assigned by the investigator.

134	Relative contribution of CYP3A to amitriptyline clearance in humans: in vitro and in vivo studies.	The relative contribution of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) to the oral clearance of amitriptyline in humans has been assessed using a combination of in vitro approaches together with a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study using the CYP3A-selective inhibitor ketoconazole. Lymphoblast-expressed CYPs were used to study amitriptyline N-demethylation and E-10 hydroxylation in vitro. The relative activity factor (RAF) approach was used to predict the relative contribution of each CYP isoform to the net hepatic intrinsic clearance (sum of N-demethylation and E-10 hydroxylation). Assuming no extrahepatic metabolism, the model-predicted contribution of CYP3A to net intrinsic clearance should equal the fractional decrement in apparent oral clearance of amitriptyline upon complete inhibition of the enzyme. This hypothesis was tested in a clinical study of amitriptyline (50 mg, p.o.) with ketoconazole (three 200 mg doses spaced 12 hours apart) in 8 healthy volunteers. The RAF approach predicted CYP2C19 to be the dominant contributor (34%), with a mean 21% contribution of CYP3A (range: 8%-42% in a panel of 12 human livers). The mean apparent oral clearance of amitriptyline in 8 human volunteers was decreased from 2791 ml/min in the control condition to 2069 ml/min with ketoconazole. The average 21% decrement (range: 2%-40%) was identical to the mean value predicted in vitro using the RAF approach. The central nervous system (CNS) sedative effects of amitriptyline were slightly greater when ketoconazole was coadministered, but the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, CYP3A plays a relatively minor role in amitriptyline clearance in vivo, which is consistent with in vitro predictions using the RAF approach.	materials and methods in vitro prediction

135	Renal dysfunction does not alter the pharmacokinetics or LDL-cholesterol reduction of atorvastatin.	The objective of this study was to determine the effects of renal dysfunction on the steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor. Nineteen subjects with calculated creatinine clearances ranging from 13 mL/min to 143 mL/min were administered 10 mg atorvastatin daily for 2 weeks. Pharmacokinetic parameters and lipid responses were analyzed by regression on calculated creatinine clearance. Correlations between steady-state atorvastatin pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters and creatinine clearance were weak and, in general, did not achieve statistical significance. Although the elimination rate constant, lambda z (0.579), was significantly correlated with creatinine clearance, neither maximum plasma concentration (Cmax, -0.361) nor oral clearance (Cl/F, 0.306) were; thus, steady-state exposure is not altered. Renal impairment has no significant effect on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin.	methods clinical methods this research tin formed approved research recruitment years using creatinine data talbert 3 analysis participants a torvastatin urine doses enzyme produces mass administered could terations tribution addition function macodynamics altered present hmg goa a 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl reductase ldl cholesterol reductions balance mg study radioactive mg showed respectively 1 2 atorvastatin data inhibitor cothat although orally excreted unpublished still alter variety atorvastatin mechanisms dysfunction renal pharmacokinetics these removal include drug absorption renal first pass nonrenal pharmacodynamics renal dysfunction assessed study atorvastatin pharmacokinetics metabolism 3 drug for effects could reasons renal dysphar aldisin clinical pharmacology dr stern pharmacok drug metabolism from departments netics abel parke davis pharmaceutical company ann arbor michigan horton ralph moore austin texas accepted stern pharmacology revised clinical drs yang olson biometrics dr research division warner lambert center submitted form may parke davis clinical research publication january reprints address drs dr ann arbor ml i j clin pharmacol study austin conducted texas before review consent years range center initiation review kg provide creatinine clinical study aus board written participants kg subjects weight clearances ml min ml min institutional committee obtained designed old estimated least ml min dialysis ml min creatinine clearance equation the gockroft mean clearances two used gault screening recruitment estimated described estimated received days days mg atorvastatin on hours fasted hours meals hours adminis day pharmacokinetic profil morning medications tration ing lipid administered subjects measurements day doses renal dysfunction and atorvasta tin pharmacokinetic methods administration ml samples blood tubes day frozen 20 176 cuntil assayed after polypropylene dose transferred plasma concentrations collected days heparmnized centrifugation tubes hours plasma stored deterassay 4 plasma nitro distilled cofac the inhibition atorvastatin enzyme acetonitrile acetone dryness human reconstituted mixture incubated 14cihmg coa reductase converted hmg coa 14c mevalonolactone exchange anion quantitated lactone column liquid scin relationship concentration validated precipitation residue isolated using evaporated reconstituted solution cloned containing human produced ph ag yield 1 x8 the mined atorvastatin protein supernatant gen water buffer tors 14clmevalonate acidic isolated 14c mevalonolactone tillation hmg coa atorvastatin curve eq ml cause ity tions atorvastatin also expressed the this atorvastatin for maximum estimated tration cmax recorded concentration time auc024 dose zoidal method constant rithm time tration time slope calculated auc024 spectrometry reductase lower assay the inhibition used limit metabolites construct quantitation specific sample measured thus calibration atorvastatin inhibitory concentrations ng beactiv simplicity atorvastatin equivalent values concentrato referred text concentrations observed plasma atorvastatin concen time observed curve estimated clearance dose hours occurred linear area using bioavailability atorvastatin oral tmax plasma last trape cl f divided apparent estimated first order linear regression the xj plasma curve atorvastatin terminal phase apparent ln 2 x2 terminal absolute natural value rate loga concentration terminal plasma versus concen half life t72 pharmacodynamic methods days fasting lipid mined assay triglycerides dase separation metrics via seattle enzymic levels trinder total end point measured cholesterol screening deter reaction enzymic glycerol hdl cholesterol phosphate levels precipitation ldl cholesterol pacific assay chemical wa oxiby bioesti pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics table i demographic creatinine clearance baseline lipid data healthy subjects subjects renal impairment yr age gender weight creatinine m f kg clearance ml min total cholesterol mg dl ldl cholesterol mg dl hdl cholesterol mg dl triglycerides dl mgi values presented median range ldl low density lipoprotein hdl high density oprotein mated friedewald equation ldl cholesterol total cholesterol ides 5 hdl cholesterol triglycer baseline values lipid average whereas surements baseline cholesterol measurements treatment days total values cholesterol triglycerides statistical methods measurements screening percent average changes ldl cholesterol analyzed day meafrom hdl used creatinine assess relation clearance regression ship atorvastatin lipid r hypothesis responses analysis estimated pharmacokinetic values calculated r determined parameters correlation p values well coefficient null	PK Trial	PK Trial	PK Trial	1	1	1
136	Ritonavir has minimal impact on the pharmacokinetic disposition of a single dose of bupropion administered to human volunteers.	A drug-drug interaction study was conducted to determine whether ritonavir (200 mg; 4 doses over 2 days) alters the pharmacokinetic disposition of bupropion (75 mg; once) coadministered to 7 healthy volunteers in a placebo-controlled 2-way crossover study. Serum samples collected from 0 to 24 hours after bupropion administration were assayed for concentrations of bupropion and metabolites (hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion). Derived pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between placebo/bupropion and ritonavir/bupropion trials by paired t test. The effect of ritonavir on most pharmacokinetic parameters was minimal (<20% mean change). The only parameters that showed a statistically significant effect were threohydrobupropion area under the blood concentration curve (14% +/- 5% decrease, mean +/- SE; P = .04) and erythrohydrobupropion time-to-maximal serum concentration (161% +/- 92% increase, P = .03), suggesting that ritonavir may inhibit the carbonyl reductase enzyme responsible for formation of these metabolites. These findings indicate that short-term ritonavir dosing has only minimal impact on the pharmacokinetic disposition of a single dose of bupropion in healthy volunteers.	materials and methods subject

137	Role of CYP2D6 in the stereoselective disposition of venlafaxine in humans.	CYP2D6 is involved in the O-demethylation metabolic pathway of venlafaxine in humans. In this study, we investigated whether this isozyme is stereoselective. Plasma samples from seven CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and five CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs), collected during a period without and with coadministration of quinidine, were analysed. Subjects were administered venlafaxine hydrochloride 18.75 mg orally every 12 h for 48 h on two occasions (1 week apart); once alone and once during the concomitant administration of quinidine sulphate every 12 h. Blood and urine samples were collected under steady-state conditions over one dosing interval (12 h). The present results show that, although CYP2D6 catalyses the O-demethylation of both enantiomers of venlafaxine, it displays a marked stereoselectivity towards the (R)-enantiomer. The oral clearance of (R)-venlafaxine was found to be nine-fold higher in EMs compared to PMs [median (range) 173 (29-611) l/h versus 20 (16-24) l/h, P < 0.005], while it was two-fold higher for (S)-venlafaxine [73 (32-130) l/h versus 37 (21-44) l/h, P < 0.05]. In EMs, quinidine decreased (R)- and (S)-venlafaxine oral clearance by 12-fold ( 0.05) and four-fold ( 0.05), respectively. In contrast, quinidine did not have any effects on renal clearance of (R)-venlafaxine [4 (2-10) l/h for venlafaxine alone versus 5 (0.6-7) l/h for venlafaxine + quinidine] and of (S)-venlafaxine [4 (1-7) l/h for venlafaxine alone versus 3 (0.4-6) l/h for venlafaxine + quinidine]. The coadministration of quinidine to EMs resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the partial metabolic clearance of (R)-venlafaxine to O-demethylated metabolites [127 (10-493) l/h down to 1 (0.1-3) l/h, 0.05], while a seven-fold reduction was measured for (S)-venlafaxine [47 (14-94) l/h versus 7 (1-19) l/h, 0.05]. In PMs, coadministration of quinidine did not significantly change oral clearance and partial metabolic clearance of (R)- and (S)-venlafaxine to its various metabolites. In contrast, data obtained on the partial metabolic clearance of (R)- and (S)-venlafaxine to N-demethylated metabolites, a reaction which is mediated by CYP3A4, suggest a lack of stereoselectivity of this enzyme.	patients and methodsstudy populationblood samples analysed in the present study for theenantiomers of venlafaxine and its metabolites werethe same as those previously analysed with a non-chiralmethod [3]. however, after the latter analysis, therewere no remaining plasma samples for one em and onepm, and the chiral analysis could be only performed onplasma samples from seven ems and five pms. all 12subjects were healthy men (age, weight, phenotype andgenotype are indicated in table 1). all volunteers werenonsmokers and had normal physical examination,electrocardiogram and routine laboratory tests. thestudy was approved by the ethics committee forhuman subjects of laval hospital, and written informedconsent was obtained from each participant. afull and detailed description of the protocol of thestudy is provided elsewhere [3].determination of cyp2d6 genotype and phenotypethe 12 volunteers had their phenotype determinedbased on the dextromethorphan urinary metabolic ratio,calculated as the relative recovery of dextromethorphanto that of its metabolite, dextrorphan, in an overnighturine collection after the oral administration of 30 mgdextromethorphan hydrobromide. all pms had a metabolicratio higher than 0.3. patient phenotype was inagreement with the genotype, which was determinedby detecting the presence of cyp2d6 3, cyp2d6 4,cyp2d6 5, cyp2d6 6 and cyp2d6 7 mutant allelesusing polymerase chain reaction technique and methodsdescribed elsewhere [3].study designsubjects received oral doses (n _ 5) of 18.75 mg ofvenlafaxine hydrochloride (effexor, wyeth-ayerst canadainc., montreal, canada) every 12 h for 48 h on twooccasions, once alone and once during the concomitantadministration of low doses of quinidine sulphate(100 mg every 12 h). the two study arms were performed1 week apart. blood samples (10 ml) wereobtained before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10and 12 h after venlafaxine administration with 100 mlof water. after the analysis with the nonchiral method[3], plasma and urine samples left were sent batchwisewith dry ice to switzerland. they were then stored at 80 8c until analysed with the chiral method. in acontrol experiment, three blank plasma samples spikedwith low, medium and high concentrations of venlafaxine,odv, ndv and of nodv, and three plasmasamples collected in three patients receiving venlafaxineas an antidepressant treatment, were analysedtwice, before and after a 1-year (for the spiked blankplasma samples) or 2-year (for the patientsÃ plasmasamples) period of storage at 20 8c. identical resultswere obtained before and after storage (variations from1% to 16% for the blank plasma samples), suggestingthat venlafaxine and its metabolites were stable whenstored in plasma during an extended period of time at 20 8c. finally, identical results were also obtained forthe (s)/(r) ratios of venlafaxine and its metabolites(variations from 1% to 16% for the patientÃs plasmasamples), suggesting that no racemization of theenantiomers took place during the storage.plasma and urine concentrations of venlafaxine and itsmetabolitesextractions of the enantiomers of venlafaxine, odv,ndv and nodv from plasma or from urine weremade according to a liquid extraction method (eap et al., unpublished data). of the 264 plasma samplesanalysed, there was enough material to perform theextraction from 1 ml of plasma for 243 samples. for theremaining 21 samples, extraction was performed withvarious amounts of plasma, ranging from 80 to 900 l,after addition of a variable amount of blank plasma toobtain for each extraction a total amount of 1 ml. foreach of these 21 samples, values of (s)- or (r)-enantiomers for venlafaxine and odv were still abovethe limits of quantification. with regard to ndv andnodv, when results for these 21 samples were belowthe limits of quantification, the results from the othersamples obtained during the kinetics, just before andjust after, and extracted with 1 ml of plasma samples,were also below the limits of quantification. thus, thelow quantity of plasma material for these 21 samplesdid not prevent the accurate determination of theenantiomers of venlafaxine and of its metabolites.urine was collected for 12 h without any pooling, andmaintained at 4Ã8 8c during collection. subsequently,urinary ph and volume were recorded, and aliquotswere stored at 80 8c. urine concentrations of theenantiomers of venlafaxine and of its metabolites weredetermined from aliquots, after enzymatic hydrolysiswith -glucuronidase (approximately 100 000 u/ml; sigmacatalogue no: g-7770, buchs, switzerland). 0.1 ml ofurine samples were incubated overnight at 37 8c with0.4 ml of blank urine, 1 ml of 0.1 mmol acetate buffer(ph 5.0), 50 l 4% sodium azide and 20 l glucuronidase.after hydrolysis, the samples were then extractedand injected into the high-performance liquid chromatography(hplc) system. calibration curves were preparedby adding known amounts of racemic ven,odv, ndv and nodv (wyeth, zug, switzerland) to1 ml drug-free plasma or 0.5 ml drug-free urine.the concentrations of the enantiomers were determinedusing a chiral high pressure liquid chromatographycolumn (analytical column: chirobiotic v, whichcontains a covently bonded glycopeptide, i.e. vancomycin,to a 5 m silica gel, 250 3 4.6 mm; astec, basle,switzerland) with a mass spectrometry detector (hp1100 series, agilent technologies, palo alto, ca,usa). to determine the order of elution of the (s)-and (r)-enantiomer of ven and odv, the pureenantiomers (wyeth) were directly injected into thehplc. the order of elution of the (s)- and (r)-enantiomer of ndv was determined by incubatingseparately (s)-ven and (r)-ven with rat liver microsomes(to produce (s)-ndv and (r)-ndv), and byinjecting the extract onto the column. because nonodv could be detected after incubation with microsomes,and as the (s)-enantiomer elutes before the (r)-enantiomer for ven, odv and ndv, the order ofelution was assumed to be identical for the enantiomersof nodv. the liquid chromatography conditions were:mobile phase: 21% tetrahydrofurane: 20% 20 mmolnh4no3: 59% h2o; flow rate: 1 ml/min. analyses wereperformed in the selected-ion monitoring mode for theions at 260.1 m/z (venlafaxine), 246.1 m/z (odv andndv) and 232.1 m/z (nodv) (fig. 1). the limit ofquantification for each enantiomer of venlafaxine,odv, ndv and nodv was 3.6 nmol, 7.6 nmol,11.4 nmol and 201 nmol, respectively. intra- and interdaycoefficients of variation determined at three concentrationsranged from 3% to 8% for venlafaxine,odv and ndv, and from 4% to 17% for nodv.data analysisoral clearance of venlafaxine was calculated as: dose ofvenlafaxine/auc0Ã12: auc0Ã12 was calculated using thelinear trapezoidal rule for ascending data and the logtrapezoidalrule for descending data [3]. auc in onedosing interval at steady-state corresponds to auc fromzero to infinity after single dose. renal clearance wascalculated as the ratio of the amount of unchangedvenlafaxine (ae0Ã12) excreted over 12 h to the auc ofvenlafaxine over the same time interval (auc0Ã12).partial metabolic clearances of venlafaxine for thesequential metabolic pathways leading to the formationof odv and nodv, or of ndv and nodv werecalculated as:partial metabolic clearance to o-desmethylated metabolites_ (aeodv _ aenodv=2)=auc0Ã12partial metabolic clearance to n-desmethylated metabolites_ (aendv _ aenodv=2)=auc0Ã12fractional recovery was calculated by dividing theamount of venlafaxine or its metabolites recovered inurines over the oral dose (molar unit) administered. allpharmacokinetic calculations were made using the softwarewinnonlin (professional version 3.1, pharsightcorporation, cary, north carolina, usa).statistical analysisrepresentative measures were expressed as medianand range. comparisons of data between the (s)- and(r)-enantiomers within each group, and comparisons ofdata between ems and pms, were made using themannÃwhitney u-test. the wilcoxon matched pairedtest was used to compare the data obtained in the samegroup before and after coadministration of quinidine(statsoft, version 4.5, loll & nielsen, hamburg, germany).p , 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

138	Safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939--an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor--after multiple dosing in healthy male subjects.	There is a clinical need for safe new oral anticoagulants. The safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939--a novel, oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor--were investigated in this single-center, placebo-controlled, single-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose escalation study. Healthy male subjects (aged 20-45 years, body mass index 18.6-31.4 kg/m(2)) received oral BAY 59-7939 (n=8 per dose regimen) or placebo (n=4 per dose regimen) on days 0 and 3-7. Dosing regimens were 5 mg once, twice (bid), or three times daily, and 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg bid. There were no clinically relevant changes in bleeding time or other safety variables across all doses and regimens. There was no dose-related increase in the frequency or severity of adverse events with BAY 59-7939. Maximum inhibition of FXa activity occurred after approximately 3 h, and inhibition was maintained for at least 12 h for all doses. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and HepTest were prolonged to a similar extent to inhibition of FXa activity for all doses. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics (AUC(tau, norm) and C(max, norm)) were observed at steady state (day 7). Maximum plasma concentrations were achieved after 3-4 h. The terminal half-life of BAY 59-7939 was 5.7-9.2 h at steady state. There was no relevant accumulation at any dose. BAY 59-7939 was safe and well tolerated across the wide dose range studied, with predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and no relevant accumulation beyond steady state. These results support further investigation of BAY 59-7939 in phase II clinical trials.	methods study design this single center placebo controlled single blind parallel group dose escalation study the

139	Safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban--an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor--are not affected by aspirin.	Rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939) is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor in advanced clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. This was a randomized, 2-way crossover study in healthy male subjects, with an aspirin run-in period, to examine whether aspirin influences the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban. All treatments were well tolerated; drug-related adverse events were mild and transient. Aspirin did not alter the effects of rivaroxaban on Factor Xa activity or clotting tests. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time were not affected by rivaroxaban, and rivaroxaban did not influence the effects of aspirin on these parameters to a clinically relevant extent. Aspirin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban, including the fraction unbound. This study suggests that there is no clinically relevant interaction between rivaroxaban and aspirin and that the 2 drugs could be administered concomitantly at the doses used in this study.	methods

140	Selegiline pharmacokinetics are unaffected by the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole.	To characterise the effects of itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics of selegiline in healthy volunteers. In this randomised, placebo-controlled crossover study with two phases, 12 healthy volunteers took either 200 mg itraconazole or matched placebo once daily for 4 days. On day 4, a single 10-mg oral dose of selegiline hydrochloride was administered. Serum concentrations of selegiline and its primary metabolites desmethylselegiline and l-methamphetamine were determined up to 32 h. A caffeine test was performed on day 3 of both phases, by measuring the plasma paraxanthine/caffeine concentration ratio 6 h after caffeine intake, to examine the role of CYP1A2 in selegiline pharmacokinetics. In addition, the effects of itraconazole on the metabolism of selegiline in vitro were characterised by using human liver microsomes. Itraconazole had no significant effects on the pharmacokinetic variables of selegiline, desmethylselegiline or l-methamphetamine, with the exception that the AUC of desmethylselegiline was increased by about 10% (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the AUC(desmethylselegiline)/AUC(selegiline) ratio and the paraxanthine/caffeine ratio (r = 0.41; P < 0.05), suggesting involvement of CYP1A2 in the formation of desmethylselegiline. In experiments with human liver microsomes, itraconazole had no inhibitory effect on the formation of either desmethylselegiline or l-methamphetamine from selegiline. The pharmacokinetics of selegiline in healthy volunteers were unaffected by the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole showed no inhibitory effect on the biotransformation of selegiline to desmethylselegiline and l-methamphetamine by human liver microsomes. These findings suggest that selegiline is not susceptible to interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors.	materials methods subjects twelve healthy non smoking volunteers nine males three females age range

141	Selegiline transdermal system: an examination of the potential for CYP450-dependent pharmacokinetic interactions with 3 psychotropic medications.	Selegiline transdermal system (STS) is a recently approved monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant. This article reports results from 3 studies examining the potential for cytochrome P450-dependent pharmacokinetic interactions between STS and 3 psychotropic medications that might be coadministered. Three open-label, randomized, Latin square, 3-sequence crossover design studies were conducted with healthy volunteers to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of STS 6 mg/24 h and test drug (alprazolam, olanzapine, or risperidone) when administered alone and concomitantly. All pharmacokinetic parameters of interest were unaltered following selegiline or test drug monotherapy when compared to concomitant therapy. This was confirmed by least squares mean ratios and their 90% confidence intervals of log(e)-transformed C(max) and AUC(tau) values, using either standard bioequivalence criteria of 80% to 125% or study-defined 70% to 143% boundary criteria. These results demonstrate that STS 6 mg/24 h may provide an antidepressant option that is unlikely to result in CYP450-mediated pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.	methods human subjects for

142	Sensitivity of intravenous and oral alfentanil and pupillary miosis as minimally invasive and noninvasive probes for hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activity.	This investigation determined the ability of alfentanil miosis and single-point concentrations to detect various degrees of CYP3A inhibition. Results were compared with those for midazolam, an alternative CYP3A probe. Twelve volunteers were studied in a randomized 4-way crossover, targeting 12%, 25%, and 50% inhibition of hepatic CYP3A. They received 0, 100, 200, or 400 mg oral fluconazole, followed 1 hour later by 1 mg intravenous midazolam and then 15 microg/kg intravenous alfentanil 1 hour later. The next day, they received fluconazole, followed by 3 mg oral midazolam and 40 microg/kg oral alfentanil. Dark-adapted pupil diameters were measured coincident with blood sampling. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios (fluconazole/control) after 100, 200, and 400 mg fluconazole were (geometric mean) 1.3*, 1.4*, and 2.0* for intravenous midazolam and 1.2*, 1.6*, and 2.2* for intravenous alfentanil (*significantly different from control), indicating 16% to 21%, 31% to 36%, and 43% to 53% inhibition of hepatic CYP3A. Single-point concentration ratios were 1.5*, 1.8*, and 2.4* for intravenous midazolam (at 5 hours) and 1.2*, 1.6*, and 2.2* for intravenous alfentanil (at 4 hours). Pupil miosis AUC ratios were 0.9, 1.0, and 1.2*. After oral dosing, plasma AUC ratios were 2.3*, 3.6*, and 5.3* for midazolam and 1.8*, 2.9*, and 4.9* for alfentanil; plasma single-point ratios were 2.4*, 4.5*, and 6.9* for midazolam and 1.8*, 2.9*, and 4.9* for alfentanil, and alfentanil miosis ratios were 1.1, 1.9*, and 2.7*. Plasma concentration AUC ratios of alfentanil and midazolam were equivalent for detecting hepatic and first-pass CYP3A inhibition. Single-point concentrations were an acceptable surrogate for formal AUC determinations and as sensitive as AUCs for detecting CYP3A inhibition. Alfentanil miosis could detect 50% to 70% inhibition of CYP3A activity, but was less sensitive than plasma AUCs. Further refinements are needed to increase the sensitivity of alfentanil miosis for detecting small CYP3A changes.	methods twelve volunteers men women participated investigation approved university washington institutional review board written informed consent obtained subjects years range good health remarkable medical problems within ideal body weight kg range history hepatic renal disease taking prescription nonprescription medications herbals known alter cyp3a activity including oral contraceptives both smokers nonsmokers enrolled subjects instructed consume grapefruitcontaining foods juices days study session study day well alcohol caffeine hours study session study day all subjects completed study cder advisory committee pharmaceutical sciences clinical pharmacology subcommittee meeting april http www fda gov ohrms dockets ac 03 slides 3947s2_02_huang ppt last accessed february american college clinical pharmacology all rights reserved not commercial use unauthorized distribution univ washington libraries november downloaded http www jclinpharm org cyp3a assessment with alfentanil the protocol 4 way randomized crossover each session pairs separated least weeks for session iv catheters placed arm vein drug administration blood sampling subjects received fluconazole mg nothing controls orally cc water two hours fluconazole received mg iv mdz thirty minutes later received ondansetron mg iv prophylaxis nausea thirty minutes later received g kg alf subjects monitored automated blood pressure cuff pulse oximeter hours alf administration received supplemental oxygen oxygen saturation less venous blood samples obtained hours mdz hours alf coincident blood sampling additional intermediate times dark adapted pupil diameter measured using pupilscan model 12a infrared pupilometer 0 1 mm resolution keeler instruments broomall pa described previously 33 35 each recorded value mean triplicate measurements typically agreed within mm pupil diameter change miosis time point predrug baseline diameter minus diameter time point the following day protocol repeated fluconazole dose subjects received mg oral mdz cc apple juice ondansetron g kg oral alf aqueous solution injection used without modification cc water blood samples obtained hours mdz hours alf dark adapted pupil diameter measured subjects fed standard breakfast hours alf administration free access food water thereafter plasma stored 20 c later analysis plasma alf mdz concentrations measured liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms selected ion monitoring data analyzed using noncompartmental methods winnonlin pharsight corp mountain view calif described previously 33 35 systemic clearance iv mdz alf cliv doseiv auciv apparent oral clearance cl f dose ral auco ral bioavailability foral aucoral doseoral doseiv auciv hepatic extraction eh determined cliv qp hepatic plasma flow qp estimated product hepatic blood flow ml kg men women 41 hematocrit estimated men women negligible extrahepatic alf metabolism assumed hepatic availability fh eh gastrointestinal availability fg calculated foral fh fabs oral dose assumed entirely absorbed thus fabs considered unity gastrointestinal extraction eg fg fluconazole assumed influence hepatic blood flow in addition formal clearance determinations single point plasma concentrations potential surrogates auc also determined concentrations used hours iv oral alf hours iv oral mdz respectively based previous results 39 alfentanil effect miois disposition curves treated analogously conventional plasma concentration curves similar noncompartmental analysis yield effect parameters similar conventional pharmacokinetic parameters hence area effect curve auec obtained in previous investigations alf miosis treated similarly plasma concentration obtain effect clearance clmiosis dose auec analogous plasma clearance dose auc effect clearance dose adjusted auec doseadjusted single point plasma alf concentrations used subjects received different alf doses different sessions enable interday comparisons 33 35 39 in present investigation subjects received alf dose session hence dose normalization necessary results expressed arithmetic mean sd unless indicated otherwise repeated measures analysis variance used assess significance differences groups sigmastat systat corp point richmond calif for repeated measures analysis nonnormal data log transformed although results significance unchanged data log transformed the auc auec single point concentration ratios without interacting drug fluconazole control used assess differences groups using geometric mean ratio confidence interval calculated statistical functions winnonlin	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
143	Short-term clarithromycin administration impairs clearance and enhances pharmacodynamic effects of trazodone but not of zolpidem.	"The kinetic and dynamic interactions of 5 mg zolpidem and 50 mg trazodone with 500 mg clarithromycin (4 doses given over 32 h) were investigated in a 5-way double crossover study with 10 healthy volunteers. The five treatment conditions were: placebo + placebo; zolpidem + placebo; zolpidem + clarithromycin; trazodone + placebo; and trazodone + clarithromycin. Coadministration of clarithromycin increased trazodone area under the curve, prolonged elimination half-life, increased peak plasma concentration (C(max)), and reduced oral clearance. In contrast, clarithromycin had no significant effect on any kinetic parameter for zolpidem. Clarithromycin did not potentiate sedation caused by zolpidem. However, clarithromycin coadministered with trazodone significantly increased self- and observer-rated sedation and ratings of feeling ""spacey."" Thus, short-term clarithromycin coadministration significantly impairs trazodone clearance, elevates plasma concentrations, and enhances sedative effects. However, clarithromycin has no significant kinetic or dynamic interaction with zolpidem."	the possibility pharmacokinetic drug interactions macrolide antimicrobial agents issue clinical concern clarithromycin second generation macrolide derivative 1 2 the group first generation macrolides erythromycin troleandomycin cause drug interactions time dependent inactivation cytochrome p450 via formation enzyme metabolite complexes 3 5 second generation macrolides clarithromycin initially thought less likely cause interactions mechanism later work showed clarithromycin impairs cyp3a activity similar degree erythromycin 6 10 third generation macrolides azithromycin dirithromycin known cause pharmacokinetic interactions 7 9 impairment cyp3a activity clarithromycin demonstrated clinical study volunteers cyp3a probe triazolam coadministered erythromycin clarithromycin azithromycin 7 azithromycin significantly affect triazolam clearance erythromycin clarithromycin reduced triazolam clearance approximately threeto fourfold in another study clarithromycin caused threefold increase area plasma concentration vs time curve auc cisapride well ms increase qt interval 11 clarithromycin also impairs metabolism cyp3a4 substrates midazolam pimozide carbamazepine disopyramide lovastatin ergotamine loratidine cyclosporin 9 10 a number studies indicate cyp3a inhibition erythromycin clarithromycin time dependent mechanism based inhibitor converted enzyme reactive metabolite covalently binds enzyme irreversibly inactivates it 3 5 7 12 14 the benzodiazepine agonist zolpidem antidepressant trazodone available generic drugs extensively prescribed clinical practice zolpidem imidazopyridine derivative high affinity gabaa receptors widely used treatment insomnia 15 18 the metabolism zolpidem mediated via cyp3a4 via cyp2c9 via cyp1a2 via cyp2d6 19 trazodone triazolopyridine derivative primarily indicated antidepressant acting via 5 ht2 receptor antagonism 5 ht reuptake inhibition 20 21 trazodone also nonspecific sedating properties prescribed sedative hypnotic cyp3a4 predominant enzyme responsible clearance 1department pharmacology experimental therapeutics tufts university school medicine tufts medical center boston massachusetts usa correspondence dj greenblatt dj greenblatt tufts edu received september accepted december advance online publication february doi 10 1038 clpt 2008 293 short term clarithromycin administration impairs clearance enhances pharmacodynamic effects trazodone not zolpidem d farkas1 lp volak1 js harmatz1 ll von moltke1 mh court1 dj greenblatt1 the kinetic dynamic interactions mg zolpidem mg trazodone mg clarithromycin doses given h investigated 5 way double crossover study healthy volunteers the five treatment conditions placebo placebo zolpidem placebo zolpidem clarithromycin trazodone placebo trazodone clarithromycin coadministration clarithromycin increased trazodone area curve prolonged elimination half life increased peak plasma concentration cmax reduced oral clearance in contrast clarithromycin significant effect kinetic parameter zolpidem clarithromycin potentiate sedation caused zolpidem however clarithromycin coadministered trazodone significantly increased selfand observer rated sedation ratings feeling spacey thus short term clarithromycin coadministration significantly impairs trazodone clearance elevates plasma concentrations enhances sedative effects however clarithromycin significant kinetic dynamic interaction zolpidem clinic al pharmacology therapeutic volume number june articles trazodone via formation principal active metabolite m chlorophenylpiperazine mcpp 22 23 in study examined pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic interactions mg clarithromycin doses given h period either mg dose trazodone mg dose zolpidem we also studied pharmacodynamic effects measures selfand observer rated sedation self ratings subjective feelings scores digit symbol substitution test dsst information acquisition recall	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
144	Short-term exposure to low-dose ritonavir impairs clearance and enhances adverse effects of trazodone.	Antiretroviral agents may participate in drug interactions that influence the efficacy and toxicity of other antiretrovirals, as well as pharmacologic treatments of coincident or complicating diseases. The viral protease inhibitor, ritonavir, may cause drug interactions by inhibiting the activity of cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) isoforms. In a single-dose, blinded, four-way crossover study, 10 healthy volunteer subjects received 50 mg of trazodone hydrochloride or matching placebo concurrent with low-dose ritonavir (four doses of 200 mg each) or with placebo. Compared to the control condition, ritonavir significantly reduced apparent oral clearance of trazodone (155 +/- 23 vs. 75 +/- 12 ml/min, p < 0.001), prolonged elimination half-life (6.7 +/- 0.7 vs. 14.9 +/- 3.9 h, p < 0.05), and increased peak plasma concentrations (842 +/- 64 vs. 1125 +/- 111 ng/ml, p < 0.05) (mean +/- SE). Coadministration of trazodone with ritonavir increased sedation, fatigue, and performance impairment compared to trazodone plus placebo; differences reached significance only for the digitsymbol substitution test. Three subjects experienced nausea, dizziness, or hypotension when trazodone was given with ritonavir; 1 of these subjects also experienced syncope. Thus short-term low-dose administration of ritonavir impairs oral clearance of trazodone and increases the occurrence of adverse reactions. The findings are consistent with impairment of CYP3A-mediated trazodone metabolism by ritonavir.	methods study design the protocol consent document reviewed approved human investigation review

145	Simvastatin but not pravastatin is very susceptible to interaction with the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole.	Itraconazole increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity of some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A' (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors by increasing their serum concentrations. We studied possible interactions of itraconazole with simvastatin and pravastatin. Two randomized, double-blind, two-phase crossover studies were performed with use of an identical design, one with simvastatin (study I) and one with pravastatin (study II). In both studies, 10 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of simvastatin (study I) or pravastatin (study II). Serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, pravastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, itraconazole, and hydroxyitraconazole were determined. In study I, itraconazole increased the peak serum concentrations (Cmax) and the areas under the serum concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] of simvastatin and simvastatin acid at least tenfold (p < 0.001). The Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) of total simvastatin acid (naive simvastatin acid plus that derived by hydrolysis of the lactone) were increased 17-fold and 19-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, and the half-life (t1/2) was increased by 25% (p < 0.05). The AUC(0-infinity) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was increased fivefold (p < 0.001) and the Cmax and t1/2 were increased threefold (p < 0.001). In study II, itraconazole slightly increased the AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of pravastatin, but the changes were statistically nonsignificant (p = 0.052 and 0.172, respectively). The t1/2 was not altered. The AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased less than twofold (p < 0.05 and p = 0.063, respectively) by itraconazole. There were no differences in the serum concentrations of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole between studies I and II. Itraconazole greatly increased serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, probably by inhibiting CYP3A-mediated metabolism, but it had only a minor effect on pravastatin. Concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A with simvastatin should be avoided or its dosage should be greatly reduced.	methods study design this investigation composed two separate studies

146	Simvastatin does not affect CYP3A activity, quantified by the erythromycin breath test and oral midazolam pharmacokinetics, in healthy male subjects.	Potential for inhibition of CYP3A activity by simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects who received placebo or 80 mg of simvastatin, the maximal recommended dose, once daily for 7 consecutive days. On day 7, an intravenous injection of 3 microCi [14C N-methyl]erythromycin for the erythromycin breath test (EBT) was coadministered with a 2 mg oral solution of midazolam. The values for percent 14C exhaled during the first hour (for EBT) and the pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam (AUC, Cmax, t1/2) were not affected following multiple once-daily oral doses of simvastatin 80 mg. The 95% confidence interval was 0.97 to 1.18 for EBT and 0.99 to 1.23 for midazolam AUC. In addition, the total urinary recoveries of midazolam and its 1'-hydroxy metabolites (free plus conjugate) obtained from both treatments were not statistically different (p > 0.200). These data demonstrate that multiple dosing of simvastatin, at the highest recommended clinical dose, does not significantly alter the in vivo hepatic or intestinal CYP3A4/5 activity as measured by the commonly used EBT and oral midazolam probes.	methods study design this study designed two period crossover single blind randomized fashion least 7 day washout periods the study protocol approved institutional review board thomas jefferson university twelve healthy men african americans caucasians mean range age years years mean range weight kg kg received two treatments a b in treatment a subjects received placebo daily days in treatment b subjects given single oral dose simvastatin mg tablet zocor daily days on day treatment subject reported clinical research unit cru receive simvastatin placebo dose supplies selfadministration days each daily dose taken approximately time within hour morning during days site personnel contacted subjects ascertain dosing time on days treatment subject reported cru site personnel administered appropriate simvastatin placebo dose approximately time within hour days dose on 7th day treatment hour following simvastatin placebo dose subjects received single mg oral dose midazolam coadministered intravenous injection 14c n methyl erythromycin midazolam oral solution mg ml dextrose water solution prepared fresh dosing day midazolam intravenous use mg ml trained pharmacy personnel subjects remained cru hours following midazolam administration treatment periods the percentage administered 14c exhaled first hour injection 14co2 h 14c n methyl erythromycin measured blood samples drawn tubes containing edta anticoagulant urine samples collected minutes hours plasma hours urine analysis midazolam metabolite 1 hydroxy midazolam 1 oh midazolam lc ms ms method physical examinations 12 lead electrocardiograms ecgs routine hematology serum chemistry urinalysis performed prestudy poststudy additional blood drawn day treatment period measure total creatine kinase liver function tests subjects assessed adverse experiences period sample analysis the activity 14c determined scintillation spectrometry packard instrument co model b1900 percentage 14co2 exhaled first hour calculated based actual 14c n methyl erythromycin dose obtained weighing dosing syringe preand postdose 17 concentrations midazolam 1 oh midazolam plasma urine determined following liquidliquid extraction methyl t butyl ether using previously described lc ms ms method 17 analysis total 1 oh midazolam 1 oh midazolam conjugates urine accomplished following drug interactions prueksaritanont et al table i percentage 14c exhaled first hour following intravenous injection 14c n methyl erythromycin healthy male subjects receiving multiple oral doses simvastatin mg placebo tablet treatment mg simvastatin placebo 14co2 exhaled h mean sd range simvastatin placebo gmr ci glucuronide hydrolysis glucuronidase enzyme ms ms analysis performed sciex ontario canada api iiiplus mass spectrometer monitoring precursor product ion pairs m z midazolam 1 oh midazolam internal standard triazolam respectively the intraand interday assay precision cv accuracy throughout calibration range ng ml ng ml plasma ng ml ng ml urine analytes plasma urine data analysis plasma auc auc0 last represents area plasma concentration time profile time last sampling time point concentration lower limit quantitation maximum concentration midazolam reached plasma cmax time maximum plasma concentration reached tmax terminal elimination half life t1 2 evaluated midazolam in case 1 oh midazolam auc0 last cmax tmax determined values reported t1 2 data set data points following cmax auc data set data points urinary recovery midazolam 1 oh midazolam conjugates percent dose across hours postdose also quantified an analysis variance model anova appropriate crossover design terms subject period treatment carryover used evaluate effect simvastatin days single mg oral doses log natural transformed parameters ebt auc0 last cmax carryover tested found nonsignificant dropped anova model the anova model assumption residuals normally distributed homogeneous variances verified shapiro wilk statistic hartley s fmax test respectively the differences percentage administered 14c exhaled first hour postdose well auc0 last cmax midazolam 1 oh midazolam coadministered simvastatin placebo assessed calculating geometric mean ratios gmr confidence intervals ci a confidence interval ebt greater auc midazolam falling within predefined using basis described previously 17 clinically insignificant provided true gmr ebt plasma auc midazolam overall power study approximately pairwise treatment comparisons applied evaluate effect simvastatin tmax t1 2 urinary recovery midazolam and or metabolites	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
147	Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antimicrobial.	The pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin and its active 14(R)-hydroxy metabolite were evaluated after single and multiple oral doses of 250 and 500 mg of clarithromycin. Multiple-dose regimens used 12-hour dosing intervals for 7 doses. Plasma and urine concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Appearance of clarithromycin and its metabolite in plasma were rapid, as reflected by mean times to maximum plasma concentration ranging from 1.8 to 2.6 and 1.8 to 2.9 hours, respectively. The rises in clarithromycin peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) were disproportionate to increase in dose, suggesting nonlinearity in parent compound pharmacokinetics. Clarithromycin terminal disposition half-life (t1/2) also exhibited dose dependency, ranging from harmonic means of 2.7 to 4.8 hours. In contrast, based on Cmax AUC, and predicted/observed accumulation ratios, nonlinearity in metabolite pharmacokinetics was not observed. Plasma accumulation of metabolite occurred to a much lesser degree than that of the parent compound despite a substantially longer t1/2 for the metabolite (metabolite accumulation ratios based on AUC dose 7/AUC dose 1:250-mg regimen = 1.03 +/- 0.33, 500-mg regimen = 0.81 +/- 0.29, parent accumulation ratios: 250-mg regimen = 1.64 +/- 0.47, 500-mg regimen = 1.65 +/- 0.69). This would suggest that formation of this metabolite is capacity-limited and that this may in part account for the nonlinearity observed in clarithromycin pharmacokinetics. Urinary excretion constituted a relatively important route of elimination of clarithromycin, with renal clearance accounting for 17 to 31% of apparent total body clearance.	methods describes manuscript study study protocols conducted single designs dose single 500 mg four results 250 mg dose similar dose multiple sepacondimultiple 500 mg this rate tions 250 mg dose dose administration tion plasma 20 176 cuntil urine collections dose study 500 mg dose urine stored study immediately 500 mg assayed dose separated for made after prompt hours centrifuga stored multiple dose frozen studies hours hours 20 176 cuntil volume quantitated frozen intervals administration administration hours aliquots assayed subjects assay methodology ages health physical profiles participation based examination electrocardiosubjects years blood evidence sensitivity medication commencement investigational prior regudrug blood months alcohol study study abuse approved commencement evidence board review city missouri informed quincy research participants study consent institucenter granted participa physical history subjects good medical urine laboratory eligible requirement prior weeks within drug receipt study disease the basis male judged sults gram excluded antibiotic lar within donation history patic tional kansas written tion drug administration sample collection lots drug 35 986 ar park regimens multiple drug all fast administration pm hours standardized bution let ries abbott drug 250 mg doses ever studies hours dose immediately drug studies doses ml water administered administered in multiple dose fasting studies lunch caloric used hours evening content pm dose 16 133 ar tablet morning dinner all meals nutrient 250 mg abbott laborato state breakdrug distritab 500 mg il studied dose dose seven 500 mg hours blood single samples every doses hours 250 mg 500 mg for single multiple ml single dose collected hours mg multiplecollected doses for drug administration administration blood mg ml samples administration hours administration urine extracted organic plasma 14 r oh high performance dure brief in known amount methloxime ate the redissolved residues injected aration used ple preparation ing reverse phase diameter palo acetonitrile mol l the tection sociates first v sample relative within day curve compounds standard concentration mg l bedford effluent verdes model acetic i second respectively concentrations metabolite liquid chromatographic clarithromycin determined plasma internal samples mixed alkalinized ethyl standard erythromycin sodium acetate hexane phase evaporated dryness acetonitrile chromatograph identical chromatography procedure c b column urine sample plasma conducted mm using procewith a carbon 1 1 prepsamusinner x cm spherisorb phenomenex rancho mobile ca acid vol vol naoh monitored phase methanol produce a environmental electrochemical ma electrodes the electric set lower mg l limit plasma deviations between day ranges 0 1 ml mg l mg l urine consisting ph deasof sciences potentials v detection 0 5 ml sample the compounds standard plasma urine less dose seven dose pharmacokinetic analysis parameters noncompartmental plasma pharmacokinetic niques 11 sus time dose calculated peak centration area curve time concentration determined calculated compartmental concentration time doses using techver infinity time hours auc time linear cmax time observation profiles versus trapezoidal rule time other cmax plasma noncompart whereas tmax con 149 j clin pharmacol pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin body mental parent total mean standard used compound ent kj data statistical programs gression choice akaike data parameters volume distribution renal clearance ap cli j apparent	PK Trial	PK Trial	PK Trial	1	1	1
148	Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone in healthy young and elderly volunteers.	To compare the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone in healthy young (18-45 years) men and women, and healthy elderly (> or = 65 years) men and women. Eight young men, 11 young women, 8 elderly men and 8 elderly women were given oral ziprasidone 40 mg day(-1), in two evenly divided daily doses, for 7 days, followed by a single 20 mg dose on day 8. Serum samples were collected immediately before the morning dose on days 1-8, for up to 12 h after dosing on day 1 and for up to 96 h after dosing on day 8. The resulting data were used to derive pharmacokinetic parameters of ziprasidone in each age and gender group. Steady-state serum concentrations of ziprasidone were achieved within 2-3 days. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone, determined 8 days after the initiation of treatment, were similar in the young men, elderly men and young women. Assessment of gender effects by analysis of variance revealed statistically significant differences in Cmax (85 vs. 69 ng ml(-1) and tmax (3.19 vs. 4.81 h) but no differences in AUC(0,12 h) or lambda(z). Assessment of age effects by analysis of variance revealed statistically significant differences in AUC(0,12 h) (560 vs. 465 ng ml(-1) h), Cmax (85 vs. 69 ng ml(-1) and lambda(z) (0.126 vs. 0.197 l h(-1) but no difference in tmax. Assessment of age and gender effects by analysis of covariance, with body weight as the covariate, did not reveal any significant differences. The mean t(1/2), z in the young men, young women, elderly men and elderly women were 3.1, 4.1, 5.7 and 5.3 h, respectively. Standard deviations of the means for the pharmacokinetic parameters for the elderly women tended to be large. The influence of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone is not clinically significant.	methods subjects the study subjects healthy young years elderly years men women all subjects body weight kg the young subjects within ideal weight age height elderly subjects within ideal weight f blackwell science ltd br j clin pharmacol suppl 15s 20s 15s k d wilner et al the women surgically sterilized least years postmenopausal practising successful contraception least months pregnant lactating women excluded study the study protocol approved independent institutional review board all subjects provided written informed consent study design this open label multiple dose study designed evaluate pharmacokinetics ziprasidone steadystate healthy young men young women elderly men elderly women two evenly divided daily doses ziprasidone administered orally dose mg dayx days followed single dose morning day the morning dose ziprasidone given ml water immediately standard breakfast eaten min period the evening dose given ml water immediately standard dinner also eaten min period the interval morning evening dose approximately h pharmacokinetic sampling collected parameters determination single dose blood samples pharmacokinetic dosing h morning dose ziprasidone day samples determination steady state pharmacokinetic parameters obtained immediately dosing h morning dose ziprasidone day additional samples determination trough serum levels ziprasidone collected immediately morning dose days estimated linear trapezoidal approximation accumulation ratio calculated auc 0 12 h day divided auc 0 12 h day the elimination rate constant lz derived least squares regression analysis serum concentration time data obtained terminal log linear phase the half life tk z calculated ln 2 lz mean tk z calculated ln 2 mean lz statistical analysis it estimated sample size eight completing subjects per group i e young men young women elderly men elderly women would provide power detect least between group difference auc day signi cance level analysis auc 0 12 h cmax undertaken natural log transformed data variables unadjusted each pharmacokinetic parameter analysed dependent variable two way analysis variance model used age gender age by gender interaction classi cation variables proc glm sas1 differences auc 0 12 h cmax also tested means two way analysis covariance model age gender age by gender interaction classi cation variables body weight continuous covariate student s t tests con dence limits used examine pair wise differences groups values p 0 05 considered statistically signi cant	PK Trial	PK Trial	PK Trial	1	1	1
149	Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone under non-fasting conditions in healthy male volunteers.	To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of ziprasidone in healthy male volunteers, and to determine the influence of ziprasidone on serum prolactin levels. Single and multiple doses of ziprasidone were given orally (as two divided daily doses), at fixed dosages of 10 and 40 mg day(-1), and using titrated regimens of 40-80 and 40-120 mg day(-1), for 14 days. All dosages were taken immediately after food. The study adopted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Prolactin response, sedative properties, tolerability, and extrapyramidal symptoms were also investigated. Steady-state exposure to ziprasidone was attained after 1 day of dosing. Mean Cmax and AUC(0,12 h) increased with increasing dose, with apparent dose-proportionality between the 20 and 60 mg dose levels. Trough-to-peak ratios at steady state ranged from 2 to 5. Accumulation ratios for the fixed-dose regimens were 1.49 and 1.48 at the 5 and 20 mg dose levels, respectively. Ziprasidone was associated with transient prolactin elevation but levels of prolactin returned to baseline within the dosing interval at steady state. There was a marginal, transient increase in serum prolactin levels which was not dose-related at the 80 and 120 mg day(-1) doses, and which was noted to attenuate with chronic dosing. Ziprasidone was generally well tolerated. The most frequent side-effect was mild or moderate headache. A minority of patients suffered first-dose postural hypotension. Ziprasidone was also associated with a mild sedative effect that became less pronounced as treatment continued. There were no drug-related changes in electrocardiogram or clinical laboratory variables that were of clinical importance. Ziprasidone is characterized by a predictable pharmacokinetic profile resulting in symptoms that reflect its pharmacological action.	methods subjects correspondence dr j j miceli department clinical

To investigate the contribution of genetic polymorphisms of SLCO1B1 and ABCG2 to the pharmacokinetics of a dual substrate, pitavastatin, 2 mg of pitavastatin was administered to 38 healthy volunteers and pharmacokinetic parameters were compared among the following groups: 421C/C(*)1b/(*)1b (group 1), 421C/C(*)1b/(*)15 (group 2), 421C/C(*)15/(*)15 and 421C/A(*)15/(*)15 (group 3), 421C/A(*)1b/(*)1b (group 4), 421A/A(*)1b/(*)1b (group 5), and 421C/A(*)1b/(*)15 (group 6). In SLCO1B1, pitavastatin area under plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)) for groups 1, 2, and 3 was 81.1+/-18.1, 144+/-32, and 250+/-57 ng h/ml, respectively, with significant differences among all three groups. In contrast to SLCO1B1, AUC(0-24) in groups 1, 4, and 5 was 81.1+/-18.1, 96.7+/-35.4, and 78.2+/-8.2 ng h/ml, respectively. Although the SLCO1B1 polymorphism was found to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin, a nonsynonymous ABCG2 variant, 421C>A, did not appear to be associated with the altered pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin.	methods subjects genotyping slco1b1 abcg2 after approval ethics review board kyushu university kyushu clinical pharmacology research clinic healthy male

151	SLCO1B1 polymorphism markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin acid.	Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is an uptake transporter located at the sinusoidal membrane of human hepatocytes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphism in the SLCO1B1 gene encoding OATP1B1 on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin. Four healthy volunteers with the homozygous SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype, 12 with the heterozygous c.521TC genotype and 16 with the homozygous c.521TT genotype (controls) were recruited. Each study participant ingested a single 40-mg dose of simvastatin. Plasma concentrations of simvastatin (inactive lactone) and its active metabolite simvastatin acid were measured for 12 h. The AUC0-infinity of simvastatin acid was 120 and 221% higher in participants with the SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype than in those with the c.521TC and c.521TT (reference) genotypes, respectively (P<0.001). The Cmax of simvastatin acid was 162 and 200% higher in participants with the c.521CC genotype than in those with the c.521TC and c.521TT genotypes (P<0.001). The Cmax of simvastatin acid occurred earlier in participants with the c.521CC and c.521TC genotypes than in those with the c.521TT genotype (P<0.05). No association existed between the SLCO1B1 genotype and the elimination half-life of simvastatin acid. Moreover, no statistically significant association was seen between the SLCO1B1 genotype and the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin lactone. SLCO1B1 polymorphism markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of active simvastatin acid, but has no significant effect on parent simvastatin. Raised plasma concentrations of simvastatin acid in patients carrying the SLCO1B1 c.521C variant allele may enhance the risk of systemic adverse effects during simvastatin treatment. In addition, reduced uptake of simvastatin acid by OATP1B1 into the liver in patients with the c.521C allele could reduce its cholesterol-lowering efficacy.	methods study participants a total young

152	Steady-state pharmacokinetic interactions of darunavir/ritonavir with lipid-lowering agent rosuvastatin.	HIV-1 protease inhibitors often cause dyslipidemia, necessitating the use of lipid-lowering agents such as rosuvastatin. However, when given concomitantly, these therapeutic agents often exhibit adverse drug interactions. In this study (phase I open-label trial, n = 12 HIV-1 seronegative participants), the authors assessed the drug interactions between darunavir/ritonavir given in combination with rosuvastatin. Participants were randomized to receive rosuvastatin (10 mg/day) or darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) alone for 7 days in a crossover design followed by combination therapy for 7 days with intervening 7-day washout periods. Intensive blood sampling for pharmacokinetics and fasting lipids was performed on days 7, 21, and 35. The geometric mean AUC(0-24 h) of rosuvastatin increased from 109 to 161 ngÃ¡h/mL (P < .005) and C(max) increased 6.7 to 16.3 ng/mL (P < .001) when coadministered with darunavir/ritonavir. In the presence of darunavir/ritonavir and rosuvastatin, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels increased by 10% (P = .007) and 56% (P = .011), whereas the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 13% (P = .006) relative to rosuvastatin administration alone. There were no significant adverse events attributable to the coadministration of these drugs. Rosuvastatin levels increase in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir coadministration, whereas the lipid-lowering benefits are blunted. The clinical significance of these changes requires further investigation.	study design participants the study randomized phase i 3 period open label controlled drug interaction study determine

153	Steady-state pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of citalopram and its metabolites in humans.	The steady-state pharmacokinetics in serum and urine of the enantiomers of citalopram and its metabolites, demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), were investigated after multiple doses of rac-citalopram for 21 consecutive days (40 mg per day) to healthy human subjects who were extensive metabolisers of sparteine and mephenytoin. Comparable pharmacokinetic variability was noted for (+)-(S)-, (-)-(R)- and rac-citalopram. Enantiomeric (S/R) serum concentration ratios for citalopram were always less than unity and were constant during the steady-state dosing interval. A modest, but statistically significant, stereoselectivity in the disposition of citalopram and its two main metabolites was observed. Serum levels of the (+)-(S)-enantiomers of citalopram, DCT, and DDCT throughout the steady-state dosing interval investigated were 37 +/- 6%, 42 +/- 3% and 32 +/- 3%, respectively, of their total racemic serum concentrations. The (+)-(S)-enantiomers of citalopram, DCT, and DDCT were eliminated faster than their antipodes. For (-)-(R)- and (+)-(S)-citalopram, respectively, the serum t1/2 averaged 47 +/- 11 and 35 +/- 4 h and AUCss averaged 4,193 +/- 1,118 h.nmol/l and 2,562 +/- 1,190 h.nmol/l. The observed enantiospecificities were apparently more related to clearance, rather than to distributional mechanisms.	materials and methods experimental design the study approved ethics committee

154	Steady-state serum concentrations of the neuroleptic perphenazine in relation to CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism.	Steady-state serum concentration to dose ratios of the neuroleptic agent perphenazine were related to CYP2D6 metabolizer status for 96 psychiatric inpatients: 88 extensive metabolizers and eight poor metabolizers. The median concentration per dose of the poor metabolizer group (0.195 nmol/L per milligram) was about twice the median (0.098 nmol/L per milligram) of the 56 extensive metabolizers without interacting medicine (p < 0.01). The rest of the extensive metabolizers (n = 32), who were comedicated with drugs that compete with perphenazine for metabolism by CYP2D6, had an intermediate median value of 0.140 nmol/L per milligram. The range of concentration/dose values for the total extensive metabolizer group extended from 0.025 to 0.688 nmol/L per milligram, that is, an almost thirtyfold variation. The concentration/dose range of the eight poor metabolizer subjects was 0.096 to 0.750 nmol/L per milligram. Serum levels not corrected for dose overlapped to a large degree among the groups, with a total range from 0.5 to 12 nmol/L. This study points toward a limited information value of CYP2D6 genotyping in the context of therapeutic drug monitoring of perphenazine.	patients and methods patients patients undergoing therapeutic drug monitoring orally administered perphenazine l met wibov clinical l harmacology therapeutics july studied during l year period blood sample taken genotyping together blood serum monitoring patients attended laboratory provides serum monitoring service general psychiatric hospital samples obtained inpatients outpatients the physician requests blood sample fills form daily dose perphenazine timing doses stated together accompanying medication the smoking status patients recorded the laboratory recommends blood samples taken morning hours evening dose days start treatment major dose adjustments followed controls every months blood samples obtained patients genotyped extensive metabolizer nine poor metabolizer subjects serum concentration data analysis confined inpatients whose blood sample taken hours last dose this group comprised extensive metabolizer eight poor metabolizer subjects accompanying medication reported request form grouped drugs might inhibit metabolism perphenazine compounds competing 2d6 isozyme general inhibitors cimetidine valproate enzyme inducers phenobarbital phenytoin carbamazepine drugs 5 eighty eight extensive metabolizer patients could divided group i patients receiving drugs known intluence perphenazine metabolism n group ii patients taking drugs competed metabolism 2d6 isozyme n a single patient receiving potentially inhibitory drug inducing drug excluded serum concentration data analysis the eight poor metabolizer patients comprised three subjects taking drugs competed metabolism 2d6 isozyme five subjects receiving drugs known influence perphenazine metabolism this group treated unit data analysis poor metabolizer subjects lack functional 2d6 isozyme the median age included patients serum concentration data analysis years range years fifty three patients women sixty four patients monitored previously results stored database the median number recorded samples three maximum analytical method perphenazine serum concentrations perphenazine assayed hplc ultraviolet detection use in house modification published method 6 serum samples extracted heptane isoamylalcohol 99 l vol vol extract applied spherisorb s5 cyano column phase separations norwalk conn methanol l0 mmol l ammonium acetate vol vol mobile phase the lower limit quantification nmol l coefficient variation five extensive metabolizer patients values quantification limit in data analysis values set equal nmol l the possible bias procedure judged negligible the laboratory suggests dose adjustments aiming reaching serum concentrations within range nmol l 7 polymerase chain reaction pcr method genotyping mutations a b cyp2d6 gene detected allele specific pcr modified published methods 8 9 genomic deoxyribonucleic acid dna obtained ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta stabilized blood diluted te buffer mmol l tris hydrochloric acid ph mmol l edta after centrifugation seconds 12 ooog supernatant aspirated pellet extracted twice ml te buffer described the cell pellet lysed resuspension buffer a mmol l potassium chloride mmol l magnesium chloride mmol l tris hydrochloric acid ph weightivol nonidet p 40 weightivol tween 20 mg l proteinase k incubated minutes c after addition demineralized water lysate incubated minutes c in principle mutation a detected allelespecific pcr amplification use primer c 5 gccttcgccaaccactccg combination either primer e4 ctgggtcccaggtcatcct wild type wt specific e5 5 ctgggtcccaggtcatccg mutant specific subsequent cleavage pcr products restriction endonuclease mva i reveals whether one two alleles possesses mutation b presence mutation b abolishes mva i cleavage site the detailed conditions follows with use lysate pcr performed total volume buffer contained clinical p hkrmhcology therapeutics volume number linnet wiboyj mmol l ammonium sulfate mmol l tris hydrochloric acid ph mmol l magnesium chloride weightivol tween mmol l deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pmol l primer u thermoprime plus dna polymerase advanced biotechnologies leatherhead surrey england thirty five pcr cycles c seconds c seconds c seconds run pcr machine perkin elmer norwalk conn ten microliters reaction analyzed agarose gel p l digested u mva i boehringer mannheim germany hours c analysis agarose gel bands visualized ultraviolet irradiation gels stained ethidium bromide homozygote deletions produce bands we analyze rare mutations c j l ll gene duplication detected present method the result pcr test revealed retrospectively advice dosing given part tdm procedure genotyping influence routine tdm procedure data analysis distributions serum concentrations concentration dose ratios generally skewed accordingly applied nonparametric statistical methods using spss pc software spss inc chicago ill	PK Trial	Special PK Trial	Genotyped PK Trial	1	3	5
155	Terbinafine increases the plasma concentration of paroxetine after a single oral administration of paroxetine in healthy subjects.	Paroxetine is believed to be a substrate of CYP2D6. However, no information was available indicating drug interaction between paroxetine and inhibitors of CYP2D6. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of terbinafine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, on pharmacokinetics of paroxetine. Two 6-day courses of either a daily 150-mg of terbinafine or a placebo, with at least a 4-week washout period, were conducted. Twelve volunteers took a single oral 20-mg dose of paroxetine on day 6 of both courses. Plasma concentrations of paroxetine were monitored up to 48 h after dosing. Compared with the placebo, terbinafine treatment significantly increased the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of paroxetine, by 1.9-fold (6.4 +/- 2.4 versus 12.1 +/- 2.9 ng/ml, p < 0.001), and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 48 h [AUC (0-48)] of paroxetine by 2.5-fold (127 +/- 67 vs 318 +/- 102 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Elimination half-life differed significantly (15.3 +/- 2.4 vs 22.7 +/- 8.8 h, p < 0.05), although the magnitude of alteration (1.4-fold) was smaller than C(max )or AUC. The present study demonstrated that the metabolism of paroxetine after a single oral dose was inhibited by terbinafine, suggesting that inhibition of CYP2D6 activity may lead to a change in the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine. However, further study is required to confirm this phenomenon at steady state.	methods subjects twelve healthy japanese volunteers nine males three females enrolled study their mean sd age range years mean body weight kg the ethics committee hirosaki university school medicine approved study protocol written informed consent obtained participant examinations sample collections blood samplings ml determination paroxetine taken heparinized tubes h administration paroxetine plasma separated immediately kept 30 c analysis at time blood samplings blood pressure heart rate measured any adverse events reported subject assay plasma concentrations paroxetine measured using high performance liquid chromatography method developed laboratory in brief extraction procedure follows 2l plasma sample added 2l m naoh 2l internal standard solution trifluperidol 2g ml 2l methanol thereafter tubes vortex mixed 52ml nheptane chloroform v v added extraction solvent after min shaking mixture centrifuged g min 4 c organic phase evaporated vacuo 40 c dryness taitec vc 960 shimadzu kyoto japan the residue dissolved 2l mobile phase 2l injected onto hplc system the hplc system consisted shimadzu lc 10at high pressure pumps shimadzu cto 10avp column oven shimadzu work station class vp chromatography integrator kyoto japan shimadzu spd 10avp kyoto japan shimadzu sil 10advp 500 2l injection volume tokyo japan column str ods ii c18 2m tokyo japan the mobile phase phosphate buffer m ph 4 6 acetonitrile perchloric acid v v v the lowest limit detection quantification ng ml respectively values intra assay inter assay coefficient variation less concentrations ng ml calibration curves paroxetine cyp2d6 genotypes study design a randomized crossover study design conducted intervals weeks one capsule containing either mg terbinafine matched placebo ml tap water given daily hours days compliance thetest drug confirmed pill count no medications taken study periods no meal allowed h dosing hours the use alcohol tea coffee cola forbidden test days for determination cyp2d6 genotype dna isolated peripheral leukocytes guanidium isothiocyanate method genotypings cyp2d6 performed using amplichip cyp450 test dna chip roche diagnostics the amplichip cyp450 test provides materials genotyping two cytochrome genes encompassing known mutations cyp2d6 gene including duplication gene deletion cyp2d6 2 10ab 14a 1xn eur j clin pharmacol 2xn 4xn 10xn 7xn 5xn 41xn the alleles without activity 14a the alleles lead decreased enzyme activity cyp2d6 9 date analyses pharmacokinetics the peak concentration cmax concentration peak time tmax obtained directly original data the area plasma concentration time curve auc calculated use lin lin trapezoidal rule auc zero infinity auc 0 elimination half life determined non compartment model winnonlin professional software pharsight cary n c usa the terminal elimination rate constant ke determined log linear regression final data points the apparent elimination half life log linear phase t1 2 calculated follows 0 693 ke statistical analysis data shown means sd tables figures paired t test used comparison plasma drug concentrations two phases i e placebo terbinafine the comparison tmaxwas performed using wilcoxon signed sample test a pvalue less regarded significant geometric mean ratios corresponding values placebo phase confidence intervals used detection significant differences when confidence interval cross result also regarded significant when calculated confidence intervals logarithmic transformation pharmacokinetic data cmax auc 0 48 total auc fell within average ratio paroxetine plus terbinafine paroxetine regarded paroxetine plus terbinafine bioequivalent paroxetine spss 13 0j windows spss japan tokyo used statistical analyses	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
156	The contribution of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A to the interaction between midazolam and clarithromycin.	To assess the relative contribution of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A inhibition to the interaction between the prototypic CYP3A substrates midazolam and clarithromycin. On day 1, 16 volunteers (eight men and eight women; age range, 20 to 40 years; weight range, 45 to 100 kg) received simultaneous doses of midazolam intravenously (0.05 mg/kg over 30 minutes) and orally (4 mg of a stable isotope, 15N3-midazolam). Starting on day 2, 500 mg clarithromycin was administered orally twice daily for 7 days. On day 8, intravenous and oral doses of midazolam were administered 2 hours after the final clarithromycin dose. Blood and urine samples were assayed for midazolam, 15N3-midazolam, and metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. There was no significant (p > 0.05) difference in the urinary excretion of 1'-hydroxymidazolam after intravenous and oral dosing on day 1 or day 8, indicating that the oral dose was completely absorbed into the gut wall. The oral clearance of midazolam was found to be significantly greater in female subjects (1.9 +/- 1.0 versus 1.0 +/- 0.3 L/hr/kg; p < 0.05) than in male subjects but not systemic clearance (0.35 +/- 0.1 versus 0.44 +/- 0.1 L/hr/kg). For women not receiving oral contraceptives (n = 6) a significant gender-related difference was observed for systemic and oral clearance and for area under the curve and elimination half-life after oral administration. A significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the systemic clearance of midazolam from 28 +/- 9 L/hr to 10 +/- 3 L/hr occurred after clarithromycin administration. Oral midazolam availability was significantly increased from 0.31 +/- 0.1 to 0.75 +/- 0.2 after clarithromycin dosing. Likewise, intestinal and oral availability were significantly increased from 0.42 +/- 0.2 to 0.83 +/- 0.2 and from 0.74 +/- 0.1 to 0.90 +/- 0.04, respectively. A significant correlation was observed between intestinal and oral availability (n = 32, r = 0.98, p < 0.05). After clarithromycin administration, a significant correlation was observed between the initial hepatic or intestinal availability and the relative increase in hepatic or intestinal availability, respectively. Female subjects exhibited a greater extent of interaction after oral and intravenous dosing than male subjects (p < 0.05). These data indicate that in addition to the liver, the intestine is a major site of the interaction between oral midazolam and clarithromycin. Interindividual variability in first-pass extraction of high-affinity CYP3A substrates such as midazolam is primarily a function of intestinal enzyme activity.	material and methodssubjects. after institutional review board approval,eight healthy male volunteers (six white and two hispanic;age, 34 + 4 years; weight, 78 -c 7 kg [mean _tsd]) and eight female healthy volunteers (six white,one black, and one asian; age, 29 + 5 years; weight,6.5 -+ 14 kg) gave written informed consent to participatein the study. volunteers were characterized by(1) no significant medical conditions as assessed bymedical history, physical examination, and blood andurine chemistry screens; (2) no long-term use of medications,except for two female volunteers taking oralcontraceptive steroids; (3) no known allergies to benzodiazepinesor macrolide antibiotics: and (4) none ofthe women were pregnant or breast-feeding.study design. a fixed-order study design was used tominimize interday variability in intestinal and hepaticcyp3a content caused by environmental, genetic, andpharmacologic changes, which may occur duringextended washout periods. alcohol and drugs (exceptfor oral contraceptives) were not allowed for 1 weekbefore and during the study. after the subjects fastedovernight, an intravenous catheter was placed in oneforearm of each subject for the withdrawal of bloodsamples and in the opposite forearm for the administrationof drug. before receiving the dose of midazolam,each subject emptied his or her bladder, and a baselineblood sample was obtained. each subject then simultaneouslyreceived 0.05 mg/kg midazolam intravenouslyover 30 minutes and 4.0 mg Ã5n3-midazolam orally asa solution. blood samples were obtained 5, 15, 30, and45 minutes and 1, 1 i/z, 2, 2%, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and24 hours after drug administration. serum was obtainedand frozen at -20Ã c until analysis. urine was collectedduring the intervals 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 12, and 12to 24 hours after the dose and frozen at -20Ã c untilanalysis. midazolam-induced sleep time was determinedas the interval between the time the subject wasno longer able to be aroused by mild auditory stimuliand the time that the subject remained awake and awarein response to mild auditory stimuli. a mild auditorystimulus was defined as speaking in a normal conversationalvoice. after the 24-hour blood draw, oral clarithromycin(500 mg) administration was initiated twicedaily for 7 days. on day 8, 2 hours after the morningclarithromycin dose, the midazolam portion of the studywas repeated. compliance with clarithromycin was conlirmedby pill count and quantitation of clarithromycinserum concentrations. abstinence from medication andalcohol was assessed through volunteer questioning.sample analysis. serum samples were processedwith use of a liquid-liquid extraction technique andquantified after derivatization with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (hewlett-packard 597 1 massselective detector and 5890a gas chromatograph) asdescribed by thummel et al.Ã monitored ions included310, 315, 398, and 403, which were used to quantifylevels of midazolam, 15n3-midazolam, lÃ-hydroxymidazolam,and iÃ-hydroxy-r5n3-midazolam, respectively.diazepam and temazepam were used as the internalstandards for parent and metabolite, respectively.and the monitored ions were 256 and 357, respectively,after derivitization with n-methyl-n-t-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide containing 1% r-butyldimethylchlorosilane(regis technologies, morton grove, ill.).the assay was used to routinely measure midazolamand metabolite concentrations of 1 rig/ml. the interdaycoefficients of variation at 5 and 50 rig/ml were 1 1%and 12% and 4.6% and 5.2% for midazolam and t5n3-midazolam, respectively. urine samples were processedas described after deconjugation with p-glucuronidase(sigma chemical co., st. louis, mo.). the midazolamconcentration in the infused solution was estimated byhplc.Ãserum samples were processed through a liquidliquidextraction method and clarithromycin serum concentrationswere estimated by hplc with electrochemicaldetection as described previously.Ãjpharmacokinetic analysis. standard model independentmethods were used to determine the pharmacokineticparameters of interest (winnonlin, version 1.1,scientific consulting inc., apex, n.c.). the terminalelimination rate constant (p) was determined by linearregression. the elimination half-life (tl/,) was determinedas tyz = 0.693/p. the maximum concentrationand time to reach the maximum concentration weredetermined by visual inspection of the data. the areaunder the concentration-time curve (auc from zero tofinal detectable midazolam serum concentration) afterintravenous and oral administration was determined bya combination of linear and logarithmic trapezoidalmethods with extrapolation to infinity.to determine the blood concentration (cblood) toserum concentration (c,,,,,) ratio, blood from a volunteerwas spiked with midazolam (10 rig/ml to 2500rig/ml) and the blood and subsequently the serum concentrationwere determined by gas chromatography-massspectrometry as described. the red blood cell (rbc)affinity, p, for midazolam was determined by the followingequatior	DDI Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	Non RCT Clinical Trial	0	2	2
157	The disposition of bupropion and its metabolites in healthy male volunteers after single and multiple doses.	The pharmacokinetics of bupropion and 3 of its basic metabolites were determined in 8 young, healthy, male volunteers after single and multiple oral doses of bupropion. Plasma profiles were obtained: 1) after a single 100 mg oral dose of bupropion hydrochloride, 2) following administration of 100 mg 8-hourly for 14 days and 3) again after a single 100 mg dose 14 days later. Plasma concentrations of the parent drug and metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Saliva secretion and pupil diameters were measured, subjective assessments of sleep made using visual analogue scales and side effects, blood counts and biochemistry were monitored. After the first dose mean elimination half lives (t1/2) of bupropion, and metabolites I and II were 8, 19 and 19 h respectively. On repeated administration there was little accumulation of the parent drug and no evidence for induction of its own metabolism. Accumulation of I was consistent with its rate of elimination after single doses while that of II was greater than predicted with prolongation of t1/2 to 35 h. Metabolite III was barely detectable after single doses but its accumulation on multiple dosing was consistent with its long half life (35 h) determined on occasion 2. Saliva secretion was significantly reduced during the multiple dosing period but there were no complaints of dry mouth. Subjective assessments of sleep were not significantly altered though one subject reported vivid dreams. There were no other adverse reactions.	subjects methods subjects eight male subjects mean age years range years weight kg range kg participated study all non smokers good general health taking

158	The disposition of fluoxetine but not sertraline is altered in poor metabolizers of debrisoquin.	Substrates and inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2D6 have overlapping structural characteristics. Two prototype serotonin uptake inhibitors, sertraline and fluoxetine, share these structural criteria and have been identified as potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 in vitro. The current study was undertaken to investigate whether genetically determined CYP2D6 activity alters the disposition of sertraline or fluoxetine or both. Single doses of sertraline (50 mg) and fluoxetine (20 mg) were administered successively to 20 young men with high (extensive metabolizers; n = 10) and low (poor metabolizers; n = 10) CYP2D6 activity. Blood and urine samples were collected for 5 to 7 half-lives and sertraline, desmethylsertraline, fluoxetine, and norfluoxetine were determined by GC and HPLC techniques. Poor metabolizers had significantly greater fluoxetine peak plasma concentrations (Cmax; increases 57%), area under the concentration versus time curve (AUCzero-->infinity; increases 290%), and terminal elimination half-life (increases 216%) compared with extensive metabolizers. The total amount of fluoxetine excreted in the urine during 8 days was almost three times higher in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers (719 versus 225 micrograms; p < 0.05), whereas the total amount of norfluoxetine excreted in urine of poor metabolizers was about half of that of extensive metabolizers (524 versus 1047 micrograms; p < 0.05). Norfluoxetine Cmax and AUCzero-->t were significantly smaller in poor metabolizers (decreases 55% and decreases 53%, respectively), and the partial metabolic clearance of fluoxetine into norfluoxetine was 10 times smaller in this group (4.3 +/- 1.9 versus 0.4 +/- 0.1 L/hr; p < 0.05). No significant differences between extensive and poor metabolizers were found for sertraline and desmethylsertraline pharmacokinetics. These data indicate that poor metabolizers accumulate fluoxetine but not sertraline and that CYP2D6 plays an important role in the demethylation of fluoxetine but not of sertraline.	methods this open

159	The effect of acetaminophen on the international normalized ratio in patients stabilized on warfarin therapy.	To determine whether an interaction exists between acetaminophen and warfarin that alters the international normalized ratio (INR). Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Anticoagulation clinic at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Thirty-six adult patients receiving warfarin with stable INRs, defined as two consecutive INRs at least 3 weeks apart that were within the therapeutic range. Patients were randomly assigned to receive acetaminophen 1 g twice/day along with matching placebo twice/day (12 patients), acetaminophen 1 g 4 times/day (12 patients), or matching placebo 4 times/day (12 patients) for 4 weeks. The primary end point was the difference in mean INR between groups at weekly intervals. Secondary end points were the percentages of patients in each group with supratherapeutic (INR > or = 0.3 above the upper limit of their therapeutic range) or subtherapeutic (INR > or = 0.2 or 0.3 below the lower limit of their respective therapeutic range of 2.0-3.0 or 2.5-3.5) INRs, and the difference in mean serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels between groups at biweekly intervals. Slow enrollment and a preliminary observation that 15 patients experienced an elevated INR prompted early termination of the study. At week 2, the group receiving acetaminophen 2 g/day had a significantly higher mean INR versus the placebo group (p=0.01). At weeks 1, 2, and 3, the acetaminophen 4-g/day group had significantly higher mean INRs compared with those in the placebo group (p=0.04, p=0.01, p=0.01, respectively). In addition, 13 (54%) of 24 patients in the acetaminophen groups combined exceeded the upper limit of their therapeutic range by 0.3 or greater compared with only 2 (17%) of 12 patients in the placebo group. No statistically significant differences in serum ALT or AST levels between either acetaminophen group versus the placebo group were found at week 4; however, there was a statistically significant increase in mean ALT level at week 2 in the acetaminophen 4-g/day group versus the placebo group. These findings support the existence of a clinically significant interaction between warfarin and daily use of acetaminophen 2-4 g, necessitating close monitoring of patients who receive this drug combination. Whether this interaction occurs when acetaminophen is taken in lower doses or is used sporadically requires further study.	methods study design this prospective randomized doubleblind placebo

160	The effect of cimetidine or omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of escitalopram in healthy subjects.	To investigate the effects of co-administration of cimetidine or omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of escitalopram. Two randomized placebo-controlled crossover studies were carried out. Sixteen healthy subjects were administered placebo, or cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) for 5 days (study 1) or omeprazole (30 mg once daily) for 6 days (study 2). On day 4 (study 1) or day 5 (study 2), a single dose of escitalopram (20 mg) was administered. Blood samples were taken at predetermined times for the measurement of serum concentrations of escitalopram and its demethylated metabolite (S-DCT). Treatment-emergent adverse events were also monitored. Co-administration with cimetidine caused a moderate increase in the systemic exposure [AUC0, infinity] to escitalopram (geometric mean ratio = 1.72, [95% CI 1.34, 2.21]) and a small increase in t(1/2) from 23.7 to 29.0 h (5.24 h [3.75, 6.70]). Co-administration with omeprazole also resulted in a moderate increase in the escitalopram AUC(0, infinity) (1.51 [1.39, 1.64]) and a small increase in t(1/2) from 26.5 to 34.8 h (8.3 h [6.44, 10.2]). There was no significant change in S-DCT AUC0, infinity after co-administration of either cimetidine or omeprazole. Co-administration of cimetidine or omeprazole had no effect on the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. In view of the good tolerability of escitalopram, the pharmacokinetic changes observed on co-administration with cimetidine or omeprazole are unlikely to be of clinical concern.	methods two randomized placebo controlled crossover studies carried sixteen healthy subjects administered placebo cimetidine mg twice daily days study omeprazole mg daily days study on day study day study single dose escitalopram mg administered blood samples taken predetermined times measurement serum concentrations escitalopram demethylated metabolite s dct treatmentemergent adverse events also monitored escitalopram geometric mean ratio methods two independent randomized double blind two way cross over studies identical design carried evaluate potential effect cimetidine omeprazole pharmacokinetics escitalopram subjects for study healthy subjects aged years male four female caucasian two black subjects cimetidine study eight male eight female caucasian one black subject omeprazole study recruited uk study design the studies designed conducted accordance principles declaration helsinki the study protocols approved independent review board covance uk subjects gave written informed consent sixteen subjects administered cimetidine mg twice daily placebo days study omeprazole mg daily placebo days study on morning day study day study single dose mg escitalopram administered the wash out period weeks treatments clinical assessment body weight electrocardiograms ecg serum biochemistry haematology urinalysis determined day phase study vital day br j clin pharmacol signs adverse events observed investigator spontaneously reported subjects throughout study periods recorded blood sampling venous blood samples ml taken analysis serum concentrations escitalopram s dct prede ned sampling times escitalopram administration drug metabolite analysis serum concentrations escitalopram s dct analyzed department drug analysis h lundbeck a s valby denmark means enantioselective high performance liquid chromatography method tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms detection alkalinized serum extracted isoamyl alcohol n heptane back extracted dilute hydrochloric acid mass spectrometric detection performed quattro lc micromass manchester uk using positive electrospray ionization multiple reaction monitoring mode the lower limit quanti cation serum nmol l escitalopram nmol l s dct the accuracy across levels precision varied genotyping cyp2d6 cyp2c19 determined according standard methods the results used aid interpretation pharmacokinetic results pharmacokinetic analysis the pharmacokinetic parameters escitalopram estimated s dct auc 0 using standard noncompartmental methods c max max statistical analysis comparisons made analysis variance nonparametric methods geometric least squares means ratios con dence intervals calculated	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
161	The effect of erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin.	To examine in vivo the effect of erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin [an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase]. Erythromycin is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 that markedly increases circulating levels of some other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. In this randomised, double-blind, two-way cross-over, placebo-controlled trial 14 healthy volunteers were given 500 mg erythromycin or placebo four times daily for 7 days. A single dose of 80 mg rosuvastatin was co-administered on day 4 of dosing. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin and active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were measured up to 96 h after dosing. Eleven volunteers had data available from both dosing periods. There was no increase in rosuvastatin plasma exposure following co-administration with erythromycin compared to placebo. In fact, following co-administration with erythromycin, rosuvastatin geometric least square mean AUC((0-t)) and C(max) were 20% and 31%, respectively, lower than with placebo. Individual treatment ratios for AUC((0-t)) ranged from 0.48 to 1.17, and for C(max) ranged from 0.33 to 2.19. Essentially all of the circulating active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and most (>94%) of the total inhibitors were accounted for by rosuvastatin. Erythromycin did not affect the proportion of circulating active or total inhibitors accounted for by circulating rosuvastatin. Erythromycin did not produce any increase in rosuvastatin plasma exposure. This indicates that CYP3A4 metabolism is not an important clearance mechanism for rosuvastatin, a result consistent with previous findings. The small decreases in rosuvastatin AUC((0-t)) and C(max) that occurred as a consequence of short-term treatment with erythromycin are unlikely to have relevance to long-term treatment with rosuvastatin.	materials methods subjects this trial enrolled healthy white male volunteers mean years range years height cm cm weight kg kg volunteers considered healthy clinically relevant conditions

162	The effect of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin.	To examine the effect of fluconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in healthy volunteers. Significantly increased plasma concentrations of fluvastatin have been observed following co-administration with fluconazole. This was a randomised, double-blind, two-way crossover, placebo-controlled trial. Healthy male volunteers ( n=14) were given fluconazole 200 mg or matching placebo once daily for 11 days; rosuvastatin 80 mg was co-administered on day 8 of dosing. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin, N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, and active and total 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors were measured up to 96 h post-dose. Following co-administration with fluconazole, rosuvastatin geometric least-square mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-t)) and peak plasma concentration (C(max)) were increased by 14% and 9%, respectively, compared with placebo (90% confidence intervals for the treatment ratios: 0.967 to 1.341 and 0.874 to 1.355, respectively). Individual treatment ratios for AUC(0-t) ranged from 0.59 to 2.23, and for C(max) ranged from 0.52 to 2.28. The limited data available for the N-desmethyl metabolite show that geometric mean C(max) was decreased by approximately 25% compared with placebo. Rosuvastatin accounted for essentially all of the circulating active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and most (>90%) of the total inhibitors. Fluconazole did not affect the proportion of circulating active or total inhibitors accounted for by circulating rosuvastatin. Fluconazole produced only small increases in rosuvastatin AUC(0-t) and C(max), which were not considered to be of clinical relevance. The results support previous in-vitro findings that CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 metabolism is not an important clearance mechanism for rosuvastatin.	materials methods subjects fourteen healthy male caucasian

163	The effect of ingestion time interval on the interaction between itraconazole and triazolam.	The plasma concentrations and effects of triazolam are markedly increased when it is ingested with itraconazole. The dependence of this interaction on the time interval of their ingestion and the possibility of avoiding the interaction by a correct daily dosing was studied. Ten healthy volunteers took part in this randomized crossover study of five phases, each separated by 4 weeks. The subjects received a single 0.25 mg oral dose of triazolam either without itraconazole or with a single 200 mg dose of itraconazole that was ingested either simultaneously with triazolam or 3, 12, or 24 hours before triazolam. Plasma concentrations of triazolam and itraconazole were determined and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 hours. Itraconazole ingested simultaneously or 3, 12, or 24 hours before triazolam increased the mean area under the triazolam concentration-time curve 3.1-, 4.8-, 4.6-, and 3.8-fold (p < 0.001), respectively. The mean increase in the peak concentration of triazolam ranged from 1.4-fold (taken simultaneously, p < 0.05) to 1.8-fold (3 or 12 hours after itraconazole, p < 0.001). The elimination half-life of triazolam was increased about threefold (p < 0.001) during all itraconazole phases. Pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam were increased along with increased plasma concentrations of triazolam. Even a single 200 mg dose of itraconazole interacts considerably with triazolam when this hypnotic agent is ingested within 24 hours after itraconazole. Thus during the daily itraconazole use this interaction cannot be avoided by increasing the time interval between their intake. Furthermore, the risk of interaction is obvious for several days after the cessation of itraconazole therapy.	methods study design six male four female healthy volunteers age range years weight range kg participated study gave written informed consent the protocol approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki finnish national agency medicines a randomized crossover study design five phases used intervals weeks each subject ingested mg oral dose triazolam halcion upjohn kalamazoo mich without itraconazole control phase pretreatment clinical pharmacology therapeutics volume number netivonee vu e olhiolu single oral dose mg itraconazole sporanox janssen pharma beerse belgium triazolam always ingested ml water pm the itraconazole dose taken either simultaneously triazolam hours lunch lunch snack hours snack triazolam the volunteers fasted hours administration triazolam standard meal hours afterward the use alcohol tea coffee cola allowed test days tobacco also forbidden none subjects receiving continuous medication except two female subjects using oral contraceptive steroids blood sampling determination triazolam itraconazole blood samples determination triazolam itraconazole concentrations taken ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta collection tubes immediately 1 2 1 1x hours administration triazolam plasma separated within minutes stored c drug concentrations determined plasma triazolam concentrations determined gas chromatography use modified method de kroon et al gaillard et al described earlier 2 4 5 the sensitivity method rig ml the coefficient day today variation r ml n rig ml n plasma itraconazole concentrations determined hplc 6 7 the coefficient day to day variation rig ml n pharmacokinetics the peak concentrations c concentration peak times tmax obtained directly original data the triazolam auc o 17 auc o a extrapolation hours infinity calculated use trapezoidal rule the terminal elimination rate constant k used extrapolation determined regression analysis log linear part concentration time curve subject the elimination half life determined equation ln2 pharmacodynamics the effects triazolam measured time blood sampling battery tests digit symbol substitution test dsst subjective drowsiness evaluated use visual analog scale maddox wing test measured coordination extraocular muscles critical flicker fusion test measured discrimination fusion flickering red light postural swayeyes open eyes closed the areas response time curves determined trapezoidal rule hours auc o 7 pharmacodynamic variable statistical analysis data expressed mean values sem median range statistical analysis performed statistical program systat windows version systat evanston ill anova repeated measures used posteriori testing done tukey test differences regarded statistically significant p values pearson s product moment correlation coefficient used correlation studies	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
164	The effect of multiple doses of cimetidine on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of quetiapine in men with selected psychotic disorders.	Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) is an atypical antipsychotic agent approved for the treatment of psychosis. It is extensively metabolized by the CYP450 3A4 isozyme. The principal aim of the study was to investigate the effect of multiple doses of cimetidine, a nonspecific P450 inhibitor, on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Thirteen patients (seven completers) with selected psychotic disorders received escalating doses of quetiapine from 25 to 150 mg three times daily on days 3 to 8 and were then maintained at 150 mg three times daily until day 19. Cimetidine (400 mg) was initiated on the afternoon of day 15 and administered three times daily with every dose of quetiapine thereafter. Quetiapine plasma concentrations were measured before and after cimetidine coadministration, and quetiapine pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Of the 13 men who entered the study, seven completed it. A slight increase in quetiapine plasma levels and reduction in oral clearance were observed after cimetidine coadministration. No serious adverse events were observed during quetiapine treatment. No clinically relevant alterations in quetiapine pharmacokinetics were observed after cimetidine coadministration in patients with psychotic disorders.	methods patient selection thirteen men (aged 18Ã60 years) with selected psy- chotic disorders were entered into this open-label, non- randomized, escalating-dose, pharmacokinetic trial con- ducted at a single center. patients were eligible for inclusion if they met dsm-iv criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder and had a history of tolerating antipsychotic medication within the preceding year. all patients provided written informed consent after the study details were explained in full. the university of cincinnati institutional review board approved this protocol. patients were excluded by the presence of any psy- chiatric disorders other than those speciÃed;

any clini- cally signiÃcant laboratory test results; an abnormal electrocardiogram (ecg) or physical examination; a history of clozapine- or other drug-induced agranulocy- tosis; participation in another drug trial within the pre- ceding 4 weeks or participation in any quetiapine trial. patients underwent brief physical examinations dur- ing the trial and thorough examination at the end of the trial. in addition, any adverse events or abnormal clini- cal laboratory parameters, ecg recordings, or vital signs were reported. restrictions patients agreed to restrict their caffeine intake to less than the equivalent of one cup of coffee per day and to drink no alcohol from 1 week before the start of the trial until completion. cigarette use was maintained at base- line levels. no medications (except acetaminophen, oral chloral hydrate, and benztropine mesylate) were al- lowed during the trial. oral chloral hydrate (_2,000 mg/day) was allowed for acute agitation or severe in- somnia. benztropine mesylate was allowed for treat- ment of moderate or severe extrapyramidal symptoms. these medications were not allowed between 8 hours before and 12 hours after the morning administration of trial medication on days 11, 15, and 19. in addition, pa- tients were asked not to eat certain foods known to in- duce or inhibit cyp450 isozymes. no rigorous exercise or sunbathing was permitted. treatment all patients had previously received antipsychotic ther- apy. six patients had received risperidone (4Ã9 mg/ day) either alone (two patients) or in combination with an- other antipsychotic (Ãuphenazine, chlorpromazine, per- phenazine, triÃuoperazine, or thiothixine) (four patients). four patients had previously received haloperidol alone, and one patient had received Ãuphenazine alone. psy- chotropic medications were withdrawn on day, 1 and pa- tients underwent a 2-day washout period. on days 3 to 8, patients received quetiapine in escalating doses from 25 to 150 mg three times daily, at approximately 7 a.m., 3 p.m., and 11 p.m. quetiapine 150 mg three times daily was then administered on days 9 to 18. the Ãnal dose was given on the morning of day 19. cimetidine 400 mg was initiated on the afternoon of day 15 and was administered three times daily with each dose of quetiapine thereafter. meal schedules were arranged so that trial medica- tion was not taken from 1 hour before until at least 2 hours after eating. on days 11, 15, and 19, patients were fasted from 8 hours before the morning dose until 4 hours after this dose, and patients remained in an up- right position for 2 hours after the morning dose on these 3 days. analytical methods blood samples (7 ml) were taken before the 7 a.m., 3 p.m., and 11 p.m. drug treatments on days 9, 10, 11, 15, 17, 18, and 19 (the 11 p.m. samples were not taken on days 11, 15, and 19). additional blood samples were taken 10, 20, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the 7 a.m. dose on days 11, 15, and 19 for determination of quetiapine plasma concentration versus time proÃles. blood samples were collected in tubes containing lithium heparin and were centrifuged to obtain plasma within 30 minutes of collection. plasma samples were frozen and then transported and stored at _20_c until analysis. all analyses were conducted by the drug kinetics group, astrazeneca, wilmington, de. plasma samples were analyzed for quetiapine using a validated procedure.8 brieÃy, this method used an internal standard (m 214,652) for quantitation of quetiapine with a quantitation range of 2.50 to 500 ng/ml using 0.4 ml of plasma and was valid from 500 to 5,000 ng/ml by sample dilution with deionized water. sample clean up was achieved by liquid-liquid extraction followed by high-per- formance liquid chromatography on a narrow-bore zor- bax stablebond phenyl column with ultraviolet absorp- tion at 225 nm for detection of quetiapine and internal standard in a shimadzu uv spectrophotometric detector. the mobile phase consisted of a mixture of 20 mm phos- phate buffer (ph 7.4), methanol, and acetonitrile (40:50:10, v/v/v ratio). for electrochemical detection of the analytes, detection by oxidation at _0.55v was achieved using a bioanalytical systems lc-44 electrochemical detector with a dual cell and ag/agcl reference electrode (bioana- lytical systems, west lafayette, in). the performance of the assay was assessed by the inclusion of spiked plasma control standards on each day of sample analyses. ac- ceptable imprecision between duplicates was speciÃed to be less than 15% relative standard deviation (rsd). the mean out-of-day precision for quetiapine was 8.1% rsd. an analytical run was acceptable if two thirds of the qual- ity-control concentrations were within _20% of the theoretical value; no runs were rejected because of unac- ceptable quality-control data. quality-control values aver- aged 94.3% (7.5% rsd) of theory. pharmacokinetic assessments pharmacokinetic data analysis was carried out by noncompartmental methods using the computer pro- gram topfit 2.0 (1993). quetiapine pharmacokinetic pa- rameters were calculated in the presence and absence of cimetidine. the steady-state quetiapine pharmacoki- netic parameters generated for this study were the max- imum observed plasma concentration (cmax,ss), the time of the maximum plasma concentration (tmax,ss), the plasma concentration immediately before dosing at 7 quetiapine and cimetidine j clin psychopharmacol, vol 22/no 2, april 2002 203 a.m., 3 p.m., and 11 p.m. (cmin,ss), the area under the con- centration versus time curve within the 8-hour adminis- tration interval (auc0Ã8h,ss) and the apparent oral clear- ance (cl/f). auc0Ã8h,ss was estimated according to the trapezoidal method. cl/f was calculated using the for- mula: cl/f _ dose/auc0Ã8h,ss. mean cmin values determined immediately before dos- ing at 7 a.m., 3 p.m., and 11 p.m. on days 9, 10, 11, 15, 17, 18, and 19 were used to indicate that steady state had been achieved. the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine on days 11 and 15 were compared to assess intrapatient variability. the quetiapine pharmacokinetics on days 11 and 15 were then compared with those for day 19 assess alterations owing to coadministration of cimetidine. statistics cmin values obtained at the same time of day were ex- amined by two-way analysis of variance (anova) to as- sess the attainment of steady state. a two-way anova with factors for subject and day was performed to eval- uate cl/f and the log-transformed parameters auc0Ã8h,ss and cmax,ss. ninety percent conÃdence intervals were calculated for the ratios of geometric means for days 15 to 11, days 19 to 11, and days 19 to 15 for auc0Ã8h,ss and cmax,ss, based on estimated day differences and standard errors from anova outputs. the post hoc analysis test was the student t-test.

165	The effect of ranitidine and cimetidine on imipramine disposition.	The pharmacokinetic characteristics of imipramine were studied after a single, oral, 100 mg dose was taken by 12 healthy male subjects following 3 days of pretreatment with placebo, cimetidine (300 mg every 6 h), and ranitidine (150 mg every 12 h) in a randomized, double blind, crossover trial. After each imipramine dose plasma samples were collected for 72 h and assayed for imipramine, desipramine, 2-hydroxyimipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine by HPLC. Cimetidine preadministration statistically prolonged imipramine t 1/2 compared to ranitidine (22.7 vs. 13.0 h) or placebo (10.8 h). Mean imipramine area under the curve (AUC) following cimetidine pretreatment was more than double that following placebo (2.633 vs. 0.966 micrograms X h X ml-1) or ranitidine (1.14 micrograms X h X ml-1) pretreatment. Imipramine apparent oral clearance was reduced in all 12 subjects after cimetidine. Compared to ranitidine or placebo, cimetidine pretreatment was associated with an increased imipramine/desipramine AUC ratio, suggesting cimetidine-induced impairment of demethylation of imipramine. Ranitidine was not observed to alter imipramine pharmacokinetics.	materials methods cimetidine demonstrated reduce clearance drugs several therapeutic classes including warfarin theophylline quinidine phenytoin propranolol impairment enzymatic hydroxylation implicated mechanism underlying interaction cimetidine warfarin antipyrine phenytoin ethanol impairment enzymatic demethylation mechanism interaction cimetidine study design twelve healthy nonsmoking adult men aged years participated study all study subjects normal routine laboratory test results including complete blood cell count serum chemistry urinalysis in addition medical history physical examination electrocardiographic findings subject normal the subjects abstained alcohol medications days prior throughout study written informed consent obtained subject study approved university institutional review board subjects received three treatments separated day washout period double blind randomized sequence ranitidine mg twice daily cimetidine 300mg four times daily placebo each treatment given days treatment two bottles given subjects follows ranitidine twice daily plus placebo times daily cimetidine times daily plus placebo twice daily placebo twice daily plus placebo 4times daily dosage forms treatment identical tablets on day treatment period fasting h subjects received mg imi orally a m university tennessee clinical research center venous blood samples obtained via indwelling catheter routine venipuncture h the catheter flushed heparin u ml sample collected each blood sample immediately centrifuged plasma separated red cells each plasma fraction stored c assayed blood also obtained ranitidine cimetidine trough concentrations treatment days a standard lunch dinner provided subject days imi administration assay imipramine metabolites imi desipramine dmi 2 hydroxyimipramine oh imi 2 hydroxydesipramine oh dmi quantitated duplicate hplc electrochemical detection the hplcsystem composed ldc constametric iii pump lcd milton roy riviera beach fl usa model rheodyne injector rheodyne inc cotati ca usa gm octyl column bioanalytical systems west lafayette in usa model lc 23a column heater bioanab ical systems west lafayette in usa model lc 3 electrochemical detector glassy carbon electrode working potential 1 05v respect ag agc1 bioanalytical systems west lafayette in usa series fisher recordall strip chart recorder fisher scientific pittsburg pa usa the mobile phase consisted m sodium perchlorate hplc grade fisher scientific pittsburg pa usa mm sodium citrate buffer ph acetonitrile burdick jackson laboratories inc muskegan mi usa the percentage acetonitrile mobile phase adjusted optimize assay time column temperature 30 c a five point standard curve calculated b g wells et al imiprarnine disposition day using spiked plasma standards whose concentrations ranged 200ng ml 2 hydroxylated metabolites ng ml imi dmi n desmethylclomipramine used internal standard the plasma extraction procedure utilized stout devane the lower limits sensitivity imi dmi ohimi oh dmi ng ng ng ng respectively the coefficient variation replicate determinations 50ng ml four measured compounds less within day less days ranitidine cimetidine interfere measurement imi metabolites analysis data pharmacokinetic parameters describing imi disposition phase study calculated serial plasma concentration versus time data fit using nonlin least squares computer program a weighting factor 1 y used curve fitting procedures the time maximal concentration tmax maximum concentration cmax taken maximum observed values area plasma concentration time curve auc zero tmax imi dmi ohimi oh dmi calculated trapezoidal method area concentration time curve tmax last time point calculated using log trapezoidal method to added residual area extrapolated infinity calculated last measured concentration divided slope terminal phase plasma concentration curve yield total auc apparent oral clearance cl mean residence time mrt calculated using standard non compartmental equations data expressed mean standard deviation unless otherwise noted differences among groups detected repeated measures analysis variance anova when difference detected duncan s multiple range test used determine group differences significant statistical analysis performed bmdp sas statistical packages a level p 0 05 used criterion establishing significant differences	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
166	The effect of the newly developed angiotensin receptor II antagonist fimasartan on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin in relation to OATP1B1 in healthy male volunteers.	Interactions between coadministered drugs may unfavorably affect pharmacokinetics. This study evaluated whether fimasartan, an angiotensin receptor II antagonist, affected the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin. A randomized, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover, multiple-dosing study was conducted with 24 healthy male volunteers. Twelve subjects received 80-mg atorvastatin once daily for 7 days; later, they received 80-mg atorvastatin with 240-mg fimasartan for 7 days. Twelve other subjects received the same drugs in the opposite sequence. Blood samples were collected scheduled intervals for 24 hours after the last dosing to determine plasma concentrations of atorvastatin acid, atorvastatin lactone, 2-hydroxy atorvastatin acid, and 2-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone. Compared with atorvastatin alone, coadministration of fimasartan and atorvastatin increased the atorvastatin acid mean (95% confidence interval) maximum concentration (Cmax,ss) by 1.89-fold (1.49-2.39) and the area under the concentration curve (AUC_,ss) by 1.19-fold (0.96-1.48). Fimasartan also increased the mean 2-hydroxy atorvastatin acid Cmax,ss and AUC_,ss by 2.45-fold (1.80-3.35) and 1.42-fold (1.09-1.85), respectively. The Cmax,ss and AUC_,ss of the lactone forms of atorvastatin showed smaller changes than those observed for the acidic forms. We showed that fimasartan raised plasma atorvastatin concentrations. In vitro tests suggested that this effect may have been mediated by fimasartan inhibition of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1.	subjects and methods subjects healthy korean male volunteers

167	The effects of acetaminophen on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin.	The oral anticoagulant warfarin is clinically administered as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (R) and (S). Many relevant drug interactions with warfarin have been attributed to the specific metabolic inhibition of the elimination of the more pharmacologically active (S)-enantiomer. To investigate reports that acetaminophen can potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, 20 healthy male volunteers were each given single oral 20 mg doses of racemic warfarin on three separate occasions: (1) alone, (2) after 1 day of acetaminophen (4 g/d), and (3) after 2 weeks of acetaminophen (4 g/d). The urinary excretion pattern of acetaminophen and its metabolites was not significantly altered over its course of administration. The (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of warfarin exhibited significantly different pharmacokinetic properties. However, acetaminophen did not alter the disposition of either (R)- or (S)-warfarin. All subjects exhibited a pharmacodynamic response to racemic warfarin. The response was not significantly altered in the presence of acute or chronic acetaminophen dosing, as assessed by prothrombin time and factor VII concentrations.	methods the study carried using two

168	The effects of concurrent atorvastatin therapy on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous midazolam.	Midazolam is a commonly used anaesthetic agent and is metabolised by the 3A4 isoform of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Atorvastatin is also metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 and, in vitro, atorvastatin inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated metabolism of mexazolam. We hypothesised that concurrent administration of atorvastatin and midazolam would result in altered midazolam pharmacokinetics. Fourteen patients scheduled to undergo general anaesthesia for elective surgery were recruited in a matched pair design to receive intravenous midazolam (0.15 mg.kg-1). Of these patients, seven were taking long-term atorvastatin. Atorvastatin patients demonstrated a greater area under the curve (889.4 (standard deviation 388.6) ng-h.ml-1) vs. control patients (629.1 (standard deviation 197.2) ng-h.ml-1) (p < 0.05). Patients taking atorvastatin also demonstrated a decreased clearance (0.18 (standard deviation 0.08) l-kg. h-1) vs. control patients (0.27 (standard deviation 0.08) l-kg.h-1) (p < 0.05). This study suggests that chronically administered atorvastatin decreases the clearance of intravenously administered midazolam.	methods eight healthy postmenopausal female volunteers enrolled

169	The effects of desvenlafaxine and paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of the cytochrome P450 2D6 substrate desipramine in healthy adults.	The potential for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 substrates to interact with desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate) and paroxetine was evaluated. In an open-label, crossover study, 20 healthy volunteers (aged 21-50) were randomized to 2 series of 9 days each of desvenlafaxine (100 mg/d) or paroxetine (20 mg/d), separated by a 5-day washout. The CYP2D6 substrate desipramine (50 mg) was administered alone on day 1 and coadministered on day 6 of dosing with either desvenlafaxine or paroxetine. CYP2D6 genotype was determined at baseline. Based on least squares geometric mean ratios between reference (desipramine alone) and test treatments, desvenlafaxine produced minor increases in desipramine area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC; 36%) and peak plasma concentration (C(max); 30%) (vs paroxetine: 419%, 90%, respectively; both P < .001). Desvenlafaxine produced little change in 2-hydroxydesipramine AUC (16% increase) and C(max) (0%) versus paroxetine (18% and 82% decreases, respectively; P = .008, P < .001, respectively), indicating that desvenlafaxine, especially at the recommended therapeutic dose of 50 mg/d for major depressive disorder in the United States, has little potential to interact with CYP2D6 substrates.	methods participants healthy men and women aged 18 to 55 years, with a body mass index ranging from 18 to 30 kg/m2, were eligible to participate. participants had no recent history of smoking or drug or alcohol abuse and were negative for the human immunodeficiency, hepatitis b, and hepatitis c viruses. only nonlactating women who were postmenopausal, surgically sterilized, or used an acceptable method of contraception (intrauterine device, diaphragm, condom with spermicidal jelly or foam, or abstinence) and had a negative urine preg- nancy test within 48 hours of study initiation were allowed to participate. participants were excluded given any of the following: presence or history of clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, psychiatric, or neuro- logic disease; any severe conditions of the ears, eyes, or throat; any surgical or medical condition that may have interfered with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study medication; history of seizure disorder (other than fully resolved childhood febrile seizure); clinically important devi- ation from normal limits in physical examination, vital signs, or clinical laboratory test results; positive urine drug screen results; donation of blood or blood products within 30 days or >500 ml before the first study drug administration; acute disease (eg, nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea) within 7 days before study day Ã1; and/or history of any clinically important allergy or adverse drug reactions to desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, paroxetine, desipramine, or imipramine. volunteers were not permitted to participate if they had used hormonal therapy, any prescription drug or investigational agent within 31 days of study drug initiation, or any over-the-counter drug or herbal supplement (except acetaminophen and vita- mins providing up to 100% of us recommended daily allowance) within 15 days of study drug initiation. all participants gave written informed consent in compliance with good clinical practice guidelines and in accordance with the declaration of helsinki; institutional review board approval was obtained. study design and protocol this was a single-center, randomized, open-label, 4-period crossover, inpatient study in healthy adult volunteers conducted at mds pharma services effects of desvenlafaxine and paroxetine on desipramine (neptune, new jersey) to evaluate the effects of multiple doses of desvenlafaxine (100 mg/d) and paroxetine (20 mg/d) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of a cyp2d6 model substrate-drug, desipramine (50 mg). screening of participants, which occurred within 2 to 14 days of study initiation, comprised a medical history, physical examination, assessment of vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ecg), serum preg- nancy test (women only), urinary drug and alcohol screen, and clinical laboratory tests. participants were required to have undergone a 10-hour fast prior to screening blood sample collection. following review of screening data, eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment sequence a (desvenlafaxine/paroxetine) or sequence b (paroxetine/desvenlafaxine). randomized partici- pants were confined to the study center for 29 days. at study site check-in (day Ã1), participant eligi- bility was reviewed, vital signs and adverse events (aes) were recorded, a urine drug and alcohol screen was conducted, blood samples were obtained for clinical laboratory investigations, a serum preg- nancy test (women only) was performed, and cyp2d6 genotyping was conducted. genotyping was performed for pharmacokinetic data analysis purposes; no participant was excluded from the study based on cyp2d6 genotype. in period 1, fol- lowing a 10-hour fast, all participants received a sin- gle 50-mg dose of desipramine administered with 240 ml room-temperature water, followed by 120 hours of blood sample (5-ml) collection. breakfast was not given on this day; food was allowed 4 hours after desipramine administration. in each of periods 2 and 4, each 9 days in duration, desvenlafaxine or paroxetine was administered with 240 ml room- temperature water within 5 minutes following breakfast. on one study day in each of periods 2 and 4 (days 11 and 25, respectively), desvenlafaxine or paroxetine was coadministered with desipramine (50 mg) along with 240 ml room-temperature water following a 10-hour fast. blood samples for pharma- cokinetic analysis were then collected for up to 120 hours. breakfast was not given on these days; food was allowed 4 hours after test drug administration. period 3 (study days 16 to 19) was the washout phase. this 5-day washout period was deemed sufficient for both desvenlafaxine and paroxetine, especially considering that this allowed for a 10-day period between the final test article administration in phase 2 and the administration of the desipramine probe in phase 4. on the final study day (day 29; there were no early terminations), a complete physical examination was conducted, along with assessment of vital signs, an ae report, a serum pregnancy test (women only), and clinical laboratory investigations. participants were followed for up to 15 days after final adminis- tration of test drug to assess safety. throughout the study, participants were required to eat medium-fat standardized meals provided by the clinic. forty-eight hours prior to study initiation and throughout the study, participants were not per- mitted to consume or use caffeine-, tobacco-, or grapefruit-containing products. men were not per- mitted to donate sperm during the course of the study and for the following 30 days, and sexually active men were required to use a condom with spermicidal jelly. participants were not permitted to use any hormonal treatment, including oral contra- ceptives or hormone replacement therapy or any prescription drug during the study period. blood sample collection and analysis for analyzing plasma concentrations of desvenlafax- ine, paroxetine, desipramine, and 2-hydroxyde- sipramine, 5-ml blood samples were collected via an indwelling catheter or direct venipuncture into sodium heparin-treated blood collection tubes. if a catheter was used, approximately 0.5 ml was to be discarded before collecting the sample each time. samples for determination of desipramine and 2- hydroxydesipramine plasma concentrations were collected on study days 1 to 5, 11 to 15, and 25 to 29 within 2 hours prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdosing. for determination of steady-state trough desven- lafaxine and paroxetine plasma concentrations, on days 11 and 12 (period 2) and days 25 and 26 (period 4), blood samples were collected within 30 minutes before drug administration. all samples were imme- diately placed on ice or refrigerated. within 50 minutes of collection, plasma was separated by cen- trifugation and stored frozen at Ã20Â¡c until analyses were performed. plasma concentrations of desvenlafaxine, paroxe- tine, desipramine, and 2-hydroxydesipramine were determined with validated liquid chromatographic (lc) methods using tandem mass spectroscopic detection (lc/ms/ms). analyses for desvenlafaxine and paroxetine were carried out at ba research international (houston, texas), and those for desi- pramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine were conducted at ppd development (richmond, virginia). for determination of desvenlafaxine and paroxetine concentrations in plasma, samples were analyzed in drug interactions 221 nichols et al runs consisting of calibration standards, quality con- trol samples, and participant samples. for desven- lafaxine, a protein precipitation extraction procedure was carried out, whereas for paroxetine, a liquid-liquid extraction was performed. the internal standards employed for desvenlafaxine and paroxetine were nadolol (50 ng/ml) and fluoxetine (30 ng/ml), respec- tively. samples were analyzed using an lc/ms/ms system (api 3000 or 4000 with turbo ionspray detection, pe series 200 lc pump, series 200 autosampler and betabasic cn, 100 _ 2.1-mm ana- lytical column for desvenlafaxine and an aquasil c18, 100 _ 2.1-mm analytical column for paroxe- tine); positive ions were measured in multiple-reac- tion monitoring mode. data were acquired and integrated based on linear regression with 1/x2 weighting. the calibration curve and control data indicated acceptable performance of the assay meth- ods during analysis of study samples; upper and lower limits of quantification were 0.2 and 50.0 ng/ml for paroxetine and 2.0 and 500.0 ng/ml for desven- lafaxine. interday variability of the assays was Â²7.2%. for determination of desipramine and 2-hydroxyde- sipramine concentrations in plasma, a liquid-liquid extraction was performed. desipramine-d3 hydrochlo- ride and 2-hydroxydesipramine-d3 were used as internal standards. lc/ms/ms used positive ion turboionspray with multiple-reaction monitoring, and linear regression with 1/x2 weighting was used for determinations. the calibration curve and con- trol data indicated acceptable performance of the assay methods during analysis of study samples; upper and lower limits of quantification for both compounds were 0.25 and 100.0 ng/ml. interday variability of the assays was Â²6.8% for desipramine and Â²14.5% for 2-hydroxydesipramine. committee and review articles published in the pri- mary literature.1,12,13 for analysis of the cyp2d6*2, *3, *4, *6, *7, *8, *9, *17, *29, and *41 alleles, a cyp2d6- specific fragment was amplified by a nested poly- merase chain reaction (pcr) strategy and analyzed by primer extension and matrix-assisted laser des- orption ionization time-of-flight analysis using multi- plexed methods developed and validated in the wyeth biomarker laboratory (wyeth research, collegeville, pennsylvania). detection of the cyp2d6*10 allele was performed using a commercially available taqman allelic discrimination assay (applied biosystems, foster city, california) according to the manufacturerÃs instructions. duplication (*xn) and deletion (*5) of the cyp2d6 gene were determined using the commer- cially available cyp2d6 deletion/duplication pcr assay kit (jurilab, finland) multiplex long pcr- based assay according to the manufacturerÃs instruc- tions. genotype call acceptance criteria using various technologies were assigned according to the methods outlined in isler et al.14 cyp2d6*1 was defined in this study as the absence of the 12 cyp2d6 alleles interrogated in this study (*2-*10, *17, *29, and *41). duplication of either the *1 allele (*1xn) or *2 allele (*2xn) resulted in an ultrarapid metabolizer (um) phenotype prediction when paired with another functional allele (*1 or *2). participants possessing at least 1 functional allele (*1 or *2) in the absence of gene duplication were classi- fied as ems. participants possessing 2 decreased activity alleles (*9, *10, *17, *29, and *41) or 1 decreased activity allele in combination with a null allele (*3, *4, *5, *6, *7, and *8) were assigned inter- mediate metabolizer (im) status. finally, participants possessing a combination of 2 null alleles were clas- sified as pms. assessment of metabolizer status statistical analysis cyp2d6 genotypes of human whole-blood samples were determined using internally developed meth- ods or commercially available assays. genomic dna was isolated from 400 Âµl of whole blood using the fuji quickgene 810 system (fujifilm life science, tokyo, japan) according to the manufacturerÃs instructions. cyp2d6 phenotypes, yielding em and pm status/activity, were predicted via genotyping the following cyp2d6 allelesÃ*2 to *10, *17, *29, *41Ãand by determining the duplication status (*xn) of the cyp2d6 gene. internally developed genotyping assays specific to each allele were designed based on data from the homepage of the cytochrome p450 (cyp) allele nomenclature descriptive statistics and statistical analyses were performed with sas version 9.1 statistical software package. the pharmacokinetic parameters for desipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve [auc], peak plasma concentration [cmax], time to cmax [tmax], and terminal-phase elimination half-life) were esti- mated using standard noncompartmental methods and characterized using mean and standard devia- tion (sd) for each treatment. to assess the effect of each combination therapy on the auc and cmax of desipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine, we calcu- lated 90% confidence intervals (cis) on the least

ance (anova) on the logarithms of the above ratios on the auc and cmax. the model defined sequence, treatment, and period as fixed effects. the null hypothesis stated that no difference in desipramine pharmacokinetic parameters would be detected given a single dose of desipramine paired with either parox- etine or desvenlafaxine. hypothesis testing was per- formed at the 5% significance level. safety was evaluated based on observed and spon- taneously reported aes, scheduled physical examina- tions, measurements of vital signs, 12-lead ecgs, and clinical laboratory evaluations. aes were coded using the coding symbols for thesaurus of adverse reaction terms dictionary. frequency, severity, and potential relationship to study drug of treatment-emergent aes (ie, those aes beginning or becoming more fre- quent or severe after the start date of the study) were determined with each treatment condition.

170	The effects of ketoconazole on ziprasidone pharmacokinetics--a placebo-controlled crossover study in healthy volunteers.	To assess the effects of multiple oral doses of ketoconazole on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of oral ziprasidone HCl. This was a 14-day, open-label, randomized, crossover study in 14 healthy subjects aged 18-31 years. Group 1 received oral ketoconazole 400 mg once daily for 6 days, followed by a 2 day wash-out period and 6 days of placebo administration. Group 2 received placebo followed by ketoconazole. Single oral doses of ziprasidone HCl 40 mg were administered on days 5 and 13 in both groups. Ziprasidone pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between placebo and ketoconazole administration periods. Co-administration of ziprasidone with ketoconazole was associated with a modest increase in ziprasidone exposure; mean ziprasidone AUC(0,infinity) increased by 33%, from 899 ng ml(-1) h with placebo to 1199 ng ml(-1) h with ketoconazole. Mean Cmax increased by 34%, from 89 ng ml(-1) to 119 ng ml(-1), respectively. The treatment effect on both of these parameters was statistically significant (P<0.02). Most adverse events were of mild intensity. There were no serious adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, abnormal ECGs, or clinically significant alterations in vital signs throughout the study. The concurrent administration of ketoconazole and ziprasidone led to modest, statistically significant increases in ziprasidone exposure, although the changes seen were not considered clinically relevant. This suggests that other inhibitors of CYP3A4 are unlikely to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone.	methods subjects allergic except fourteen healthy individuals men women years old weighing kg within ideal body weight age height gender frame enrolled study subjects evidence history clinically signi cant untreated asymptomatic seasonal allergies haematological renal endocrine pulmonary gastrointestinal cardiovascular hepatic psychiatric neurological disease including forms epilepsy excluded smokers subjects condition could affect drug absorption subjects known drug alcohol dependence drug allergies also excluded women required surgically sterilized least years postmenopausal using reliable contraception least months subjects excluded taken prescription medication except contraceptives over thecounter recreational drugs within weeks investigational drug within weeks study entry alcohol concomitant medications allowed study the study institutional review board approval all subjects gave informed written consent ziprasidone when ziprasidone administered subjects eat sign measurements drink caffeinated decaffeinated beverages h dosing lie except vital pharmacokinetic sampling analysis blood samples collected morning dosing days tubes containing edta determination trough plasma concentrations ketoconazole plasma separated whole blood samples centrifugation within h collection on days ziprasidone dosing days blood samples collected plain tubes preservative anticoagulant serum separator ziprasidone dosing h morning ziprasidone dose these samples allowed clot room temperature extract serum measurement ziprasidone concentration all samples stored x20u c analysed either ziprasidone ketoconazole concentrations serum ziprasidone concentrations determined using h p l c assay using solid phase extraction procedure ultraviolet u v detection this assay dynamic range ng mlx concentrations ng mlx reported ng mlx trough plasma ketoconazole concentrations also assayed using validated h p l c method u v detection this assay dynamic range ng mlx protocol data analysis study following screening this randomized open label placebo controlled crossover subjects randomized two groups subjects group received once daily oral ketoconazole mg food morning day increased mg days after day wash out period days received placebo days subjects group treated exactly group except received placebo days ketoconazole days single oral doses ziprasidone hcl mg administered days during 14 day study period subjects received ketoconazole placebo outpatient basis however subjects housed research facility continuous medical supervision least h prior h dosing ziprasidone days ziprasidone administered ml water immediately consumption standard high fat breakfast ketoconazole placebo taken ml water light breakfast except day group day group co administered the effect ketoconazole ziprasidone pharmacokinetics assessed comparing pharmacokinetic parameters days treatment groups maximum observed serum concentrations ziprasidone cmax time cmax occurred tmax determined directly experimental data the terminal elimination phase rate constant lz estimated individual concentration time curves using least squares regression analysis data obtained log linear phase the terminal phase half life ziprasidone tk z calculated ln 2 lz mean half life ziprasidone estimated ln 2 mean lz total area concentration time curve auc 0 determined sum auc 0 t auc t auc 0 t estimated using linear trapezoidal approximation time last sample quanti able concentrations ziprasidone auc t estimated cpest lz cpest estimated concentration time based regression analysis log concentration time curve 72s f blackwell science ltd br j clin pharmacol suppl 71s 76s an estimated subjects seven receive ketoconazole seven receive placebo required detect difference change auc 0 two groups power signi cance level an analysis variance anova model containing sequence period treatment effects used log transformed auc 0 cmax analyse natural proc glm sas1 signi cance level differences ziprasidone pharmacokinetic parameters concomitant placebo ketoconazole treatments estimated comparing adjusted means groups variances covariances con dence limits calculated using sas1 lsmeans function tolerability assessments tolerability assessments study clinical laboratory tests including liver function tests alkaline phosphatase aspartate aminotransferase sgot alanine aminotransferase sgpt total bilirubin h day days vital sign measurements blood pressure pulse rate days physical examinations performed screening completion discontinuation study adverse events occurring study treatment days last day dosing recorded using standard costart de nitions classi ed according investigator s intensity mild moderate severe causal relationship study drug assessment	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
171	The effects of multiple doses of fenofibrate on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin and its 3alpha-hydroxy isomeric metabolite.	Published data indicate that coadministration of multiple doses of the fibrate drug, gemfibrozil, led to a 202% increase in pravastatin systemic exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve, AUC). To evaluate the effects of another fibrate drug, fenofibrate, on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin, 24 healthy subjects took pravastatin (40 mg once daily) on study days 1 to 15 and fenofibrate (160 mg once daily) on study days 6 to 15. Blood samples were collected for 24 hours after dosing on days 5, 6, and 15. Plasma concentrations of pravastatin and its active metabolite, 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin, were measured, and pharmacokinetics was assessed. Safety assessments were based on adverse events, physical examinations, electrocardiogram results, vital signs, and clinical laboratory testing. Safety results were unremarkable. Coadministration of fenofibrate had modest effects on pravastatin and 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin systemic exposures (AUC). Increases in pravastatin systemic exposures (19%-28%, on average) and 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin systemic exposures (24%-39%, on average) were observed upon coadministration, but individual changes were variable. Pravastatin and 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin systemic exposures were not statistically significantly different following the 1st and 10th doses of fenofibrate.	study design and proceduresthis phase

dosing on study days 5, 6, and 15.plasma concentrations of pravastatin and 3_-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin were determined at mdspharma services (st laurent, quebec, canada) using avalidated liquid chromatographymethod and selectedreactionmonitoring tandemmass spectrometric detection.briefly, pravastatin, 3_-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin,and the isotopically labeled internal standard(pravastatin-d9)were extracted from human plasma byelution from preconditioned c-8 solid-phase extractiondisks. the eluent was dried, reconstituted, andsubjected to reversed-phase high-performance liquidchromatographic analysis on a 5-_m c-18 column. ape sciex api 3000 mass spectrometry system using aturbo ion spray sourcewas used tomonitormass transitionsof 423.2 _ 321.0, 423.2 _ 321.0, and 432.2 _321.0 for pravastatin, 3_-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin, andpravastatin-d9, respectively.the calibration curves included 10 nonzero standardscovering the linear range of the assay from approximately0.10 to 100 ng/ml for both analytes. thelower limit of quantitation (lloq) for both analyteswas set to the concentration of the lowest nonzero calibrationstandard, or approximately 0.10 ng/ml, using a500-_l plasma sample. the precision of the assay was948 Â¥ j clin pharmacol 2005;45:947-953gustavson et alassessed using intra-assay and interassay coefficient ofvariation (cv) values. intra-assay precision cvs forboth analytes were Â²7.1%, and interassay precisioncvs for both analytes were Â²6.3%. the accuracy of theassaywas assessed usingmean analytical recovery values.intra-assay recoveries for both analytes were between95.4%and 99.5%of their theoretical values, andinterassay recoveries for both analytes were between93.3% and 100.3% of their theoretical values.in-study quality control (qc) samples were supplementedwith concentrations of approximately 0.3, 45,and 90 ng/ml of each analyte and were analyzed withthe unknowns. the interassay precision cvs for the accepteddata ranged from 2.4%to 11.1%and from5.5%to 33.0% for pravastatin and 3_-hydroxy-isopravastatin,respectively. themean analytical recoveriesranged from 93.9%to 98.1%of their theoretical valuesfor pravastatin and from 97.8% to 119.8% for 3_-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin.values for the pharmacokinetic parameters ofpravastatin and 3_-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin were estimatedusing noncompartmentalmethods (winnonlin-professional, version 4.1, pharsight corporation,mountain view, calif). parameters included the maximumobservedplasma concentration (cmax), the time tocmax (peak time, tmax), the minimum observed plasmaconcentration (cmin), the area under the plasma concentration-time curve during a 24-hour dosing interval(auc24), the terminal phase elimination rate constant(_z), and the corresponding terminal elimination halflife(t1/2). the auc24 was calculated using the trapezoidalrule, and _z was calculated fromthe slope of theleast squares linear regression of the logarithms of theplasma concentration versus time data from the terminallog-linear phase of the profile. for pravastatin only,the apparent oral clearance (cl/f, where f is thebioavailability) was also calculated.paired t tests were performed for cmax, auc24, tmax,and _z at a significance level of .05 to assess the effectsof fenofibrate coadministration. comparisons weremade for each of study days 6 and 15 with study day 5and for study day 15 with study day 6. logarithmictransformation was employed for auc24 and cmax. nostatistical analyseswere performed for cmin because theminimumconcentrations were below the lloq for themajority of subjects for both analytes. the t tests wereperformed using proc univariate on sas, version8.2 (sasinstitute,cary,nc).the paired t test approachwas preferred over analysis of variance (anova) withpost hoc comparisons and correction formultiple comparisonsbecause the anova required additional assumptionsregarding the homogeneity of the variancesof the dependent variables.in connection with the paired t tests for the logarithmsof auc24 and cmax, a point estimate and 90%confidence interval for exposure during fenofibratecoadministration relative to exposure for pravastatinalone were provided. the point estimate and confidenceinterval endpoints were obtained by exponentiatingthe point estimate and 90% confidence limitsfor the change in the logarithm mean.the number and percentage of subjects reportingtreatment-emergent adverse events were tabulated bythe costart11 term and body system, with and withouta breakdown by study segment (pravastatin aloneand coadministration of pravastatin and fenofibrate).laboratory test values and vital signs measurementsthat were outside of predefined ranges were identifiedand evaluated for clinical significance.

172	The effects of paroxetine on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone extended-release tablets.	Co-morbid medical and psychiatric conditions are common in individuals with schizophrenia. As such, selecting antipsychotic medications with a low potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial, as many are extensively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes. This randomized, crossover study examined the effects of paroxetine (a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetic parameters of a single dose of the novel antipsychotic agent, paliperidone extended-release tablets (paliperidone ER), in healthy subjects. The mean C (max) and AUC of paliperidone were slightly higher and paliperidone clearance was slightly lower following co-administration of paliperidone ER with paroxetine. There was a ratio of geometric treatment means of 116.48% for AUC (infinity) [90% CI: 104.49-129.84]. However, the increase in total exposure to paliperidone was not considered clinically relevant. The incidence of adverse events was lower when subjects received the combination of paliperidone ER and paroxetine compared with paroxetine alone. Results suggest that no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction occurs when paroxetine and paliperidone ER are co-administered and, therefore, initiation or discontinuation of concomitant treatment with CYP2D6-inhibiting drugs does not appear to warrant an adjustment in paliperidone ER dosage.	methods subjects sixty men aged years eligible participate study previously genotyped cyp2d6

173	The effects of the systemic antimycotics, itraconazole and fluconazole, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous and oral midazolam.	We studied the interaction of azole antimycotics with intravenous (IV) and oral midazolam using a cross-over design in 12 volunteers, who ingested placebo, itraconazole, or fluconazole for 6 days. A 7.5-mg dose of midazolam was ingested on the first day, 0.05 mg/kg was administered IV on the fourth day, and 7.5 mg orally on the sixth day. Itraconazole reduced the clearance of IV midazolam by 69% and fluconazole reduced the clearance of IV midazolam by 51% (P < 0.001). A single dose of itraconazole and fluconazole increased the area under the oral midazolam concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 3.5-fold (P < 0.001) and the peak concentration two-fold (P < 0.05) compared to placebo. On the sixth day the AUC(0-infinity) of oral midazolam was almost seven times greater with itraconazole (P < 0.001) and 3.6 times greater with fluconazole (P < 0.001) than without the antimycotics. The psychomotor effects of midazolam were also profoundly increased (P < 0.001). The psychomotor tests demonstrated only a weak interaction between the antimycotics and IV midazolam. When bolus doses of midazolam are given for short- time sedation, the effect of midazolam is not increased to a clinically significant degree by itraconazole and fluconazole, and it can be used in normal doses. However, the use of large doses of IV midazolam increases the risk of clinically significant interactions also after IV midazolam. Use of oral midazolam with itraconazole and fluconazole should be avoided.	methods in vitro cytochrome p450 cyp enzyme evaluation studies duloxetine 4 oh duloxetine 5 oh duloxetine 6 oh duloxetine

174	The influence of cimetidine on the disposition kinetics of the antidepressant venlafaxine.	The influence of cimetidine on the disposition pharmacokinetics of the antidepressant drug, venlafaxine, and its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, was examined in 18 healthy young men and women. The steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles of venlafaxine and O-desmethylvenlafaxine were evaluated during a 24-hour period after 5 days of treatment with venlafaxine (50 mg three times a day) and during a second 24-hour period after 5 days of combination treatment with venlafaxine (50 mg three times a day) and cimetidine (800 mg once a day). The apparent oral clearance of venlafaxine decreased significantly in the presence of cimetidine and the average steady-state plasma concentration of venlafaxine increased significantly in the presence of cimetidine, but there were no changes in the corresponding concentrations of the active metabolite. However, O-desmethylvenlafaxine exhibits pharmacologic activity that is approximately equimolar to that of venlafaxine, and the sum of venlafaxine plus O-desmethylvenlafaxine plasma concentrations was increased by an average of only 13%. Therefore, the effect of cimetidine coadministration is not expected to result in clinically important alterations in the response to venlafaxine in patients with depression. This may not be true, however, for patients with compromised hepatic metabolic function.	methods subjects healthy volunteers were ch3ch3 i ch3 - ch3_n oh venlafaxine 0-desmethylvenlataxine h ch3_ n-desmethylvenlataxine no-didesmethylvenlataxine twenty-four 18 (9 men subjects years). for men basis biochemical excluded sults a history sion or agents gestion within within smoking ingestion were and ranged weight the women 9 women) in age ranged and 60 from from to status i). health (table of medical history, laboratory entry the test the into normal findings. study ranges or alcohol abuse. from outside of drug enrolled study.

175	The interaction of diltiazem with lovastatin and pravastatin.	Lovastatin is oxidized by cytochrome P4503A to active metabolites but pravastatin is active alone and is not metabolized by cytochrome P450. Diltiazem, a substrate and a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A enzymes, is commonly coadministered with cholesterol-lowering agents. This was a balanced, randomized, open-label, 4-way crossover study in 10 healthy volunteers, with a 2-week washout period between the phases. Study arms were (1) administration of a single dose of 20 mg lovastatin, (2) administration of a single dose of 20 mg pravastatin, (3) administration of a single dose of lovastatin after administration of 120 mg diltiazem twice a day for 2 weeks, and (4) administration of a single dose of pravastatin after administration of 120 mg diltiazem twice a day for 2 weeks. Diltiazem significantly (P < .05) increased the oral area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of lovastatin from 3607 +/- 1525 ng/ml/min (mean +/- SD) to 12886 +/- 6558 ng/ml/min and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) from 6 +/- 2 to 26 +/- 9 ng/ml but did not influence the elimination half-life. Diltiazem did not affect the oral AUC, Cmax, or half-life of pravastatin. The average steady-state serum concentrations of diltiazem were not significantly different between the lovastatin (130 +/- 58 ng/ml) and pravastatin (110 +/- 30 ng/ml) study arms. Diltiazem greatly increased the plasma concentration of lovastatin, but the magnitude of this effect was much greater than that predicted by the systemic serum concentration, suggesting that this interaction is a first-pass rather than a systemic event. The magnitude of this effect and the frequency of coadministration suggest that caution is necessary when administering diltiazem and lovastatin together. Further studies should explore whether this interaction abrogates the efficacy of lovastatin or enhances toxicity and whether it occurs with other cytochrome P4503A4-metabolized 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, such as simvastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin.	methods clinical protocol ten healthy volunteers men women provided written informed consent approved institutional review board indiana university indianapolis ind all volunteers within ideal body weight mean f sd weight f kg mean age f years table i the history physical examination ecg hematologic biochemical tests showed abnormal findings none volunteers histories smoking alcohol abuse none women taking oral contraceptives alcohol medications allowed within days study study no study drug allowed days study subjects abstained caffeine containing beverages days throughout study the study conducted outpatient basis except lovastatin pravastatin dosing days a randomized 4 way crossover design applied the arms study administration single dose mg lovastatin orally administration single dose mg pravastatin orally administration single dose lovastatin orally weeks mg diltiazem cardizem sr twice day administration single dose pravastatin orally weeks mg diltiazem cardizem sr twice day each arm separated minimum weeks blood samples determination lovastatin pravastatin serum concentrations obtained l hours dosing the final dose diltiazem administered hour lovastatin pravastatin dose samples obtained times hours determination diltiazem concentrations the serum samples stored 70 c assayed drug assays diltiuzem diltiazem concentrations serum samples quantified hplc method modification described yeung et al 25 diltiazem resolved internal standard imipramine mobile phase buffer mol l sodium acetate tetraethylammonium ph glacial acetic acid tetrahydrofuran methanol acetonitrile the mobile phase flow set ml min pm cs column cm x mm ultrasphere beckman instruments san ramon calif detection ultraviolet absorbance wavelength nm a pl aliquot serum extracted ml hexane basification pl sodium bicarbonate io ph standard curves prepared range concentrations ng ml quantification achieved linear regression peak area ratios standard concentrations quality controls prepared described concentrations ng ml the limit detection ng ml the intraday interday variability less lovastatin pravastatin serum concentrations lovastatin pravastatin determined method used gas chromatography mass spectrometry described detail morris et al 26 the lactone lovastatin quantitatively converted free acid base hydrolysis simvastatin used internal standard a structural analog sq bristol myers squibb princeton nj used internal standard pravastatin the pentafluorobenzyl trimethylsilyl derivatives free acids quantified use negative ion chemical ionization finnigan ssq fragment ions m z pravastatin lovastatin respectively correspond loss pentafluorobenzyl group the detection limit compounds ng ml all serum concentrations reported sodium salt equivalents free acid data analysis the area serum concentration time curve auc last measured sample determined combination log trapezoidal linear trapezoidal methods 27 the terminal elimination rate constant k determined unweighted log linear regression terminal serum concentration time points the auc extrapolated infinity use ratio terminal serum concentration k half life determined 0 693 k steady state diltiazem concentrations determined sd analyzed 2 sided student test paired values significance level p i stepwise multiple linear regression performed jmp statistical package model discrimination using f test sas institute car y nc the relationship area serum concentration time curve lovastatin presence auc absence auc diltiazem average diltiazem serum concentration i examined means unweighted linear regression equation l auc auc i k ki equilibrium inhibition constant putative inhibitor diltiazem this relationship assumes inhibition competitive nature attributable hepatic extraction hepatic elimination consistent well stirred model hepatic clearance it noted cyp3a substrates lovastatin may experience significant gut wall elimination therefore equation strictly valid for substrates equation applicable auc auc fg fg i k f f intestinal wall availabilities presence absence inhibitor	DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	RCT DDI Clinical Trial	0	0	0
176	The interaction of diltiazem with simvastatin.	Simvastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase that is used as a cholesterol-lowering agent and is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes. Diltiazem is a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A enzymes and is commonly coadministered with cholesterol-lowering agents such as simvastatin. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of diltiazem on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin. A fixed-order study was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers with a 2-week washout period between the phases. In one arm of the study, a single 20-mg dose of simvastatin was administered orally; the second arm entailed administration of a single 20-mg dose of simvastatin orally after 2 weeks of treatment with 120 mg diltiazem twice a day. Diltiazem significantly increased the mean peak serum concentration of simvastatin by 3.6-fold (P < .05) and simvastatin acid by 3.7-fold (P < .05). Diltiazem also significantly increased the area under the serum concentration-time curve of simvastatin 5-fold (P < .05) and the elimination half-life 2.3-fold (P < .05). There was no change in the time to peak concentration for simvastatin and simvastatin acid. Diltiazem coadministration resulted in a significant interaction with simvastatin, probably by inhibiting CYP3A-mediated metabolism. Concomitant use of diltiazem or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A with simvastatin should be avoided, or close clinical monitoring should be used.	methods clinical protocol. ten healthy volunteers (five men and five women) provided written informed consent to participate in this study, which was approved by the indiana university institutional review board. all vol- unteers were within 15% of ideal body weight (mean Â± sd weight, 73 Â± 14 kg); the mean age of the volunteers was 27 Â± 5.3 years (table i). no abnormalities were found in history, physical examination, ecg, or hema- tologic and biochemical tests. none of the volunteers had a history of smoking or alcohol abuse, and none of the women were taking oral contraceptives. alcohol and medications were not allowed for 7 days before or dur- ing the study. no study drug was allowed for 30 days before the study. the subjects abstained from caffeine- containing beverages for 2 days before and throughout the study. the study was conducted on an outpatient basis except for the simvastatin dosing days. a fixed-order design was applied. the two arms of the study were (1) administration of a single oral 20-mg dose of simvastatin and (2) administration of a single oral dose of simvastatin after 2 weeks of 120 mg diltiazem (cardizem sr) two times a day. the two arms were separated by 2 weeks. after subjects fasted overnight, simvastatin was administered at approxi- mately 8 am on the study day, and a standard lunch was provided at midday. blood samples for determination of simvastatin serum concentrations were obtained at 0, 1Ã4, 1Ã2, 3Ã4, 1, 11Ã2, 2, 21Ã2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. blood samples obtained at 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours were also used for determination of serum diltiazem concentrations. drug assays. diltiazem concentrations were quanti- fied by hplc with ultraviolet detection, as described by abernethy et al.30 diltiazem was resolved from the internal standard desipramine with a mobile phase of 0.06 mol/l acetate buffer/acetonitrile/methanol (58:37:5) that contained 5 mmol/l heptane sulfonic acid and glacial acetic acid to adjust ph to 6.4. a reversed-phase c18 Âµbondapak column (30 cm _ 3.9 mm, waters chromatography, milford, mass) was eluted at 1.8 ml/min and detection was by ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm. the calibration range of con- centrations was 5 to 300 ng/ml. the intraday and inter- day variability was 9.3% or less. serum concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were determined by a method that was developed by wu et al,31 described by lilja et al,32 and performed at advanced bioanalytical services (ithaca, ny). a clinical pharmacology & therapeutics volume 67, number 3 mousa et al 269 fig 1. mean (+sd) serum concentration versus time curves for simvastatin (20 mg) in the presence (squares) and absence (circles) of diltiazem (120 mg twice a day) treatment for 2 weeks (n = 10). solid-phase extraction procedure was used to isolate both analytes from 0.5 ml human serum with use of lovastatin and lovastatin hydroxy acid as internal stan- dards. sample extracts were reconstituted and analyzed by turbo ion-spray liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (lc/ms/ms) in the positive ion mode. the assay demonstrated a lower limit of quantitation of 0.5 ng/ml for both analytes with a 0.5 ml sample volume, and calibration curves were linear up to 100 ng/ml for both analytes. the intraday and interday pre- cision and accuracy were within 8% and 7%, respec- tively. simvastatin and simvastatin acid were stable in human serum in an ice-water bath (about Â²10Â¡c) for up to 24 hours, after three freeze-thaw cycles, and in reconstitution solution for up to 96 hours at 4Â¡c. data analysis. the area under the serum concentra- tionÃtime curve (auc) up to the last measured sample was determined by a combination of log-trapezoidal and linear-trapezoidal methods.33 the terminal elimi- nation rate constant (ke) was determined by unweighted log-linear regression of at least four terminal serum con- centrationÃtime points. the auc(Â°) was obtained by extrapolation to infinity with use of the ratio of the ter- minal serum concentration to ke. the percentage of the area extrapolated beyond the latest measured concentra- tion was 11% or less for simvastatin. half-life (t1Ã2) was determined from 0.693/ke. steady-state diltiazem concen- trations were determined from the 0- to 12-hour auc divided by the 12-hour dosing interval. all data are expressed as mean and sd and were analyzed by the two- sided student t test for paired values at a significance level of p < .05. stepwise, multiple linear regression was per- formed by the jmp statistical package with model dis- crimination by use of an f-test (sas institute, cary, nc). the relationship between area under the serum con- centrationÃtime curve of simvastatin in the presence [auc(Â°)diltiazem] and absence [auc(Â°)control] of dilti- azem and average diltiazem serum concentration (i) was examined by use of unweighted linear regression with equation 1.34 auc(Â°)diltiazem/auc(Â°)control = (1 + i/ki) (1) in which ki is the equilibrium inhibition constant of the putative inhibitor diltiazem. this relationship assumes that (1) the inhibition is competitive in nature, (2) the loss of drug during absorption and elimination is caused by hepatic extraction alone, and (3) hepatic elimination is consistent with the well-stirred model of hepatic clearance. it should be noted that cyp3a substrates, such as simvastatin, may experience significant gut wall elimination and therefore equation 1 is not strictly valid. for such substrates equation 2 is applicable.29 auc(Â°)diltiazem/auc(Â°)control = (fg*/fg) Ã¡ (1 + i/ki) (2) in which fg* and fg are the intestinal wall availabili- ties in the presence and absence of the inhibitor. how- 270 mousa et al clinical pharmacology & therapeutics march 2000 table ii.

177	The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin in combination with ambrisentan in healthy volunteers.	Ambrisentan is an oral, propanoic acid-based endothelin receptor antagonist often co-administered with warfarin to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for ambrisentan to affect warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In this open-label cross-over study, 22 healthy subjects received a single dose of racemic warfarin 25 mg alone and after 8 days of ambrisentan 10 mg once daily. Assessments included exposure (AUC(0-last)) and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) for R- and S-warfarin, and International Normalized Ratio maximum observed value (INR(max)) and area under the curve (INR(AUC(0-last))). The effects of warfarin on ambrisentan steady-state pharmacokinetics and the safety of ambrisentan/warfarin co-administration were assessed. Data are presented as geometric mean ratios. Ambrisentan had no significant effects on the AUC(0-last) of R-warfarin [104.7; 90% confidence interval (CI) 101.7, 107.7) or S-warfarin (101.6; 90% CI 98.4, 105.0). Similarly, ambrisentan had no significant effects on the C(max) of R-warfarin (91.6; 90% CI 86.2, 97.4) or S-warfarin (89.9; 90% CI 84.8, 95.3). Consistent with these observations, little pharmacodynamic change was observed for INR(max) (85.3; 90% CI 82.4, 88.2) or INR(AUC(0-last)) (93.0; 90% CI 90.8, 95.3). In addition, co-administration of warfarin did not alter ambrisentan steady-state pharmacokinetics. Adverse events were infrequent, and there were no bleeding adverse events. Multiple doses of ambrisentan had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of warfarin. Therefore, significant dose adjustments of either drug are unlikely to be required with co-administration.	methods in this open-label cross-over study, 22 healthy subjects received a single dose of racemic warfarin 25 mg alone and after 8 days of ambrisentan 10 mg once daily. assessments included exposure (auc0Ãlast) and maximum plasma concentration (cmax) for r- and s-warfarin, and international normalized ratio maximum observed value (inrmax) and area under the curve (inrauc(0Ãlast)). the effects of warfarin on ambrisentan steady-state pharmacokinetics and the safety of ambrisentan/warfarin co-administration were assessed. data are presented as geometric mean ratios. methods pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is a serious and life-threatening disease characterized by progressive vasoconstriction, vascular remodelling and in situ throm- bosis [1, 2]. disease progression is associated with signiÃ- cant resistance and sustained elevations in pulmonary artery pressure, which ultimately lead to right ventricular failure and death [1, 3]. increases in pulmonary vascular prothrombotic changes, including increased platelet activity, are characteristic of pah [2]; therefore, anticoagu- lants such as warfarin are commonly administered to prevent thrombus formation in this patient population [4]. the pharmacodynamic response to warfarin includes increased prothrombin time (pt), which is often expressed as an international normalized ratio (inr) [5]. warfarin is administered as a racemic mixture of r(+) and s(Ã) enantiomers, and the s-enantiomer is approximately two- to Ãvefold more potent than the r-enantiomer with respect to coagulation activity [6]. both warfarin enanti- omers are metabolized in the liver by cytochrome p450 (cyp) isoenzymes: r-warfarin is primarily metabolized by cyp1a2 and cyp3a4, whereas s-warfarin is primarily metabolized by cyp2c9 [7]. concomitant therapies that alter cyp enzyme activities may alter the pharmaco- kinetic exposure of warfarin and signiÃcantly affect clot- ting time as measured by inr. decreased inr could potentially lead to a higher risk of thromboembolism, while increased inr could result in signiÃcant bleeding episodes. endothelin receptor antagonists (eras) have emerged as a promising class of therapeutic agents for pah [4]. bosentan and sitaxsentan are sulphonamide-based eras that have proven effective in the treatment of pah [8, 9]; however, both drugs have been shown to alter warfarin metabolism by affecting the activity of cyp3a4 and cyp2c9. ambrisentan is a once-daily, orally active, pro- panoic acid-based, receptor subtype a (eta) selective era that is approved for the treatment of pah. ambrisentan has been shown to improve exercise capacity, delay time to clinical worsening, reduce disease symptoms, and improve cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in patients with pah [10Ã12]. unlike bosentan and sitaxsentan, ambrisentan does not inhibit cyp2c9 or cyp3a4 and is therefore unlikely to have drugÃdrug interactions with warfarin and other cyp-metabolized drugs [11]. this study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of multiple doses of ambrisentan on the pharma- cokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single racemic dose of warfarin, as well as to assess the effects of warfarin on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of ambrisentan. in addition, the safety and tolerability of ambrisentan and warfarin co-administration were evaluated. induce or 528 / 67:5 / br j clin pharmacol subjects men and women aged 18Ã55 years with a body mass index of 18.5Ã29.9, weight _50 kg, and in good health were eli- gible for this study. determination of health was based on a comprehensive pre-study examination that included medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ecg) and clinical laboratory tests. subjects were required to be nontobacco users, and agreed to discontinue the intake of caffeine, alcohol, grapefruit products, liver, and leafy green vegetables. at screening, subjects were also required to have pt, inr and partial thromboplastin time values within normal limits, serum aspartate aminotrans- ferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations <1x the upper limit of normal, and negative laboratory results for human immunodeÃciency virus, hepatitis b and hepa- titis c. female subjects were required to be surgically sterile by hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. subjects were excluded if they had current evidence or history of alcohol dependence, bleeding disorders, sensi- tivity to warfarin or ambrisentan, or signiÃcant allergies. subjects were also excluded if they had donated or received blood products within 30 days prior to the Ãrst dose of study drug, or had received any medication, herbal remedies, food or alcohol that were known to interfere with cyp enzyme metabolism within 2 weeks prior to the Ãrst dose of study drug. all participants provided written informed consent. the study was reviewed and approved by aspire independent review board (san diego, ca, usa). study design/treatments this was a phase 1, open-label, Ãxed-sequence, two-way, crossover, single-centre study to evaluate the potential for a pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interaction of multiple doses of ambrisentan with a single dose of warfarin in healthy subjects (figure 1). following a screen- ing period of 21 days, subjects were administered a single dose of racemic warfarin 25 mg (bristol-myers squibb,prin- ceton, nj, usa) on day 1. on days 5 to 16, subjects received a single daily dose of ambrisentan 10 mg (gilead sciences, inc., formerly myogen, inc., westminster, co, usa). on day 13, subjects were administered a single 10-mg dose of ambrisentan together with a single 25-mg dose of war- farin. all study medications were administered under fasted conditions and under the supervision of clinical study site personnel. this study was performed in compli- ance with the principles of good clinical practice and the declaration of helsinki. pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics blood samples for the pharmacokinetic assessments of r- and s-warfarin were collected at the following times relative to the day 1 and day 13 warfarin doses: predose (_30 min prior), and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72 lack of ambrisentan and warfarin drug interaction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 days warfarin 25 mg ambrisentan 10 mg od warfarin 25 mg (warfarin pk/pd) (warfarin pk/pd) abs ( ) pk ( abs ) pk ( ambrisentan trough pk ) figure 1 study dosing regimen and blood sampling schedule. single doses of racemic warfarin 25 mg were administered on days 1 and 13, and ambrisentan 10 mg was administered once daily from day 5 to day 16. od, once daily;

178	The pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole after chronic administration in adults.	We have studied the pharmacokinetics of the anti-mycotic ketoconazole in seven patients who took it for 1-6 months at a dose of 200 mg daily. The mean elimination half-life of the drug was 3.3 h, and although the ketoconazole was given only once daily, a satisfactory clinical response was obtained in all seven individuals. Only a small fraction of the absorbed drug (mean 0.22%) was excreted unchanged in the urine, suggesting almost complete metabolism. Our results support the concept that anti-mycotic activity in the tissues continues after the plasma drug concentration has fallen below a critical level.

Possible effects of the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole on the pharmacokinetics of standard antidepressant therapies (ADTs) were assessed in two open-label, non-randomised studies in healthy subjects (Studies 1 and 2) and two placebo-controlled studies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 3 and 4). Healthy subjects received venlafaxine 75 mg/day (Study 1; N = 38) or escitalopram 10 mg/ day (Study 2; N = 25) with the addition of aripiprazole 10-20 mg/day (10 mg/day fixed dose in Study 2) for 14 days. Patients with MDD (N = 498; Studies 3 and 4) received escitalopram (10-20 mg/day), fluoxetine (20-40 mg/day), paroxetine controlled-release (37.5-50 mg/day), sertraline (100-150 mg/day) or venlafaxine extended-release (150-225 mg/day) for 8 weeks plus placebo. Incomplete responders were randomised (1:1) to placebo or adjunctive aripiprazole 2-20 mg/day. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of ADTs. Plasma concentration-time data from Studies 3 and 4 were combined for statistical analysis. In healthy subjects, point estimates [90% CI] for the ratios of geometric means of C( max) (venlafaxine 1.148 [1.083-1.217]; escitalopram 1.04 [0.99-1.09]) and AUC(TAU) (venlafaxine 1.183 [1.130-1.238]; escitalopram 1.07 [1.04-1.11]) indicated no meaningful increase in ADT exposure in the presence of aripiprazole. In patients, point estimates for mean plasma concentration ratios indicated no substantial effect of aripiprazole on any ADT escitalopram 0.970 [0.911-1.033], fluoxetine 1.177 [1.049-1.321], paroxetine 0.730 [0.598-0.892], sertraline 0.958 [0.887-1.035] or venlafaxine 0.966 [0.887-1.051]. Aripiprazole had no meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of standard ADTs in either healthy subjects or patients with MDD.	materials and methods all four studies were conducted in accordance with the decla- ration of helsinki and the international conference on harmo- nization guidelines for good clinical practice and were approved by the institutional review board (irb) or indepen- dent ethics committee at each site before study initiation. study 1 (cn138-462; nct00362271) was conducted at sea- view research, inc., miami, florida, usa and approved by the independent investigational review board, florida, usa. study 2 (cn138-463; nct00361790) was conducted at quin- tiles phase i services, lenexa, kansas, usa and approved by heartland irb, kansas, usa. written informed consent was obtained from each subject before study entry. subjects studies 1 and 2 enrolled healthy male and female subjects aged 18Ã45 years with a body mass index (bmi) of 18Ã33 kg/m2 between august and september 2006 (study 1) or august and november 2006 (study 2). excluded were women who were pregnant, breastfeeding or of childbearing potential without an acceptable contraceptive method; subjects with any signifi- cant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric illness or history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome or acute dystonic reactions and subjects with a history of allergy to the study treatments or related compounds, or exposure to mono- amine oxidase inhibitors, or cyp2d6 or cyp3a4 inhibitors or inducers in the 4 weeks before the study. 2006. study 4 2004 and april study 3 (cn138-139; nct00095823) enrolled patients with mdd from 24 sites in the united states of america between june (cn138-163; nct00095758) was conducted at 34 sites in the united states of america between september 2004 and december 2006. the details of patients enrolled in studies 3 and 4 have been pre- sented elsewhere (berman, et al., 2007; marcus, et al., 2008). briefly, enrolled outpatients were aged 18Ã65 years with a major depressive episode that had lasted Â³8 weeks without an adequate response to adt (defined as a <50% reduction in severity of depressive symptoms when assessed by the massa- chusetts general hospital antidepressant treatment response questionnaire within the current depressive episode). study design studies studies 1 and 2 these were open-label, non-randomised, phase i that assessed the effects of aripiprazole (abilifyÂ¨) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine (effexorÂ¨ xr) or escitalopram (lexaproÂ¨) as well as the safety and tolerability of aripiprazole when co-administered with these adts. the same batches of each medication were used throughout both studies. in both studies, patients received adts for a period prior to aripiprazole administration to allow steady-state concentrations to be achieved. in study 1, following a 28-day screening phase, eligible sub- jects received oral venlafaxine 75 mg/day for 4 days (days Ã4 to Ã1). a tolerability assessment was then conducted (study day 1). additional treatment with aripiprazole was initiated for 14 days (day +1 to day +14), subject to tolerability, during which patients continued to receive the same dose of venlafax- ine. the initial dose of aripiprazole was 10 mg/day, given for 3 days, followed by titration of the dose to 15 mg/day for 4 days and 20 mg/day for 7 days. further tolerability assessments were made immediately before each titration step, and dose reduction was allowed for tolerability. subjects who were unable to tolerate either adt, or who were unable to tolerate aripiprazole doses of at least 10 mg/day, were discontinued. the design of study 2 was similar, except that subjects received escitalopram 10 mg/day for 7 days (day Ã7 to day Ã1) before the addition of once-daily aripiprazole 10 mg/day on study day 1 for a further 14 days (day +1 to day +14). studies 3 and 4 these were identically designed multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of aripi- prazole as adjunctive therapy in patients with mdd. the design for studies 3 and 4 is described in detail elsewhere (ber- man, et al., 2007; marcus, et al., 2008). briefly, during an 8-week, prospective treatment phase to establish inadequate response to standard adt, patients were assigned to single- blind placebo plus one of the following open-label adts (with indicated target doses that needed to be achieved by the end of the third treatment week): escitalopram (10Ã20 mg/day), fluoxetine (20Ã40 mg/day), paroxetine controlled-release (cr) (37.5Ã50 mg/day), sertraline (100Ã150 mg/day) or venlafaxine extended-release (150Ã225 mg/day). adt were supplied by a centralized vendor, and assignment to a particular adt was based on the patientÃs medical history, previous experience with adt treatment and the clinical judgment of the study physician. aripiprazole was manufactured in bulk by the study sponsor and several batches were used due to the large patient population. patients who met criteria for an incomplete response to adt at week 8 entered a 6-week, double-blind treatment phase in which they continued the same fixed-dose adt and were randomised (1:1) to either adjunctive placebo or aripipra- zole (2Ã20 mg/day; or 2Ã15 mg/day for patients receiving fluox- etine or paroxetine cr, due to the known increase in aripipra- zole levels with cyp2d6 inhibition). patients who were unable to tolerate treatment were discontinued. assessments in studies 1 and 2, an evaluation was performed before initia- tion of aripiprazole to ensure that the subjects were adequately tolerating the adt alone. safety and tolerability assessments included adverse event (ae) monitoring, measurement of vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms and labora- antidepressant pharmacokinetics with aripiprazole 3 tory test parameters. pharmacokinetic variables for the adts (venlafaxine, its active metabolite o-desmethylvenlafaxine [odv] and escitalopram) included maximum observed plasma concentration (cmax), trough observed plasma concentration (cmin), time of maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) and area under the concentrationÃtime curve over 24 h (auctau). blood samples for pharmacokinetic measurements were collected over a 24-h period on days 1 (for venlafaxine, odv, or escitalopram monotherapy pharmacokinetics) and 14 (for venlafaxine, odv, or escitalopram adjunctive to aripipra- zole pharmacokinetics) and pre-dose or at clock-matched times on days 14 and 15 for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole pharmacokinetics for an assessment of aripiprazole steady-state conditions. efficacy and safety assessments for studies 3 and 4 are described previously (berman, et al., 2007; marcus, et al., 2008) and not reported here. blood samples were obtained for adt (and, where applicable, active metabolite) plasma con- centration measurements of study treatments at weeks 4, 6 and 8 during treatment with adt alone and at weeks 12, 13 and 14 during double-blind addition of adjunctive aripiprazole or placebo. no assessment of aripiprazole or dehydro- aripiprazole plasma concentrations was conducted in these studies as aripiprazole was presumed to be at steady state after 2 weeks of once-daily dosing. the timing of the blood sample collection at each visit was not controlled with respect to the time of adt dosing. thus, it was possible blood samples were collected at different times post-dose at each visit. pharmacokinetic analysis plasma samples were assayed by pharmatical product develop- ment, inc. (ppd development) (richmond, virginia, usa) or alta analytical laboratory inc. (el dorado hills, california, usa). following liquidÃliquid or solid-phase extraction, plasma concentrations of venlafaxine, aripiprazole and their active metabolites and escitalopram in studies 1 and 2, or escitalo- pram, fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine, paroxe- tine, sertraline and its active metabolite desmethylsertraline or venlafaxine and its active metabolite odv in studies 3 and 4, were analysed using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy or high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection during the period of known analyte stability (table 1). the assay for escitalopram was not enantios- pecific as clinical data suggest that escitalopram does not con- vert following dosing with escitalopram (sogaard, et al., 2005). escitalopram is metabolised to s- demethylcitalopram (s-dct) and s-didemethylcitalopram (s- ddct). however, unchanged escitalopram remains the pre- dominant compound in plasma, and studies have shown that escitalopram is significantly more potent than s-dct and s- ddct in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that escitalopram metabolites do not contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of escitalopram (rao, 2007). thus, s- dct and s-ddct were not included in the pharmacokinetic analysis of escitalopram. to its r-isomer 4 antidepressant pharmacokinetics with aripiprazole table 1 analytical methods for aripiprazole and standard antidepressants in all four studies analyte method of analysisa internal standard column and mobile phase between-run and within-run variability (cv%) column: aquasil c18, 2.1 mm _ 50 mm, 5 _m Â²8.25 and 19.06 (cn138463) mobile phase a: 0.1% formic Â²6.02 and 10.01 citalopram lc-ms/ms citalopram-d4 venlafaxine and odv hplcc maprotiline fluoxetine and norfluoxetine lc-ms/ms fluoxetine-d5 and norfluoxetine-d5 paroxetine lc-ms/ms paroxetine-d6 sertraline and desmethylsertraline lc-ms/ms indrataline acid in 2 mm ammonium acetate mobile phase b: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, gradient at 0.250 ml/min column: waters spherisorb cn-rp, 4.6 mm _ 250 mm, 5 _m mobile phase: 50:50 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, ph 6.8/acetonitrile, isocratic at 2.00 ml/min column: betabasic 18, 2 mm _ 50 mm, 5 _m mobile phase: 0.1% formic acid, 1% formic acid in acetonitrile, gradient at 0.200Ã0.300 ml/min column: hypersil bds c8, 2.1 _ 50 mm, 5 _m mobile phase: 85:15 methanol/5.0 mm ammonium acetate buffer, isocratic at 0.300 ml/min (cn138139) Â²6.25 and 8.14 (cn138163) 56.90 (cn138462) venlafaxine: Â²7.45 and 19.97 (cn138462) Â²6.38 and 12.44 (cn138139) Â²5.41 and 12.39 (cn138163) odv: Â²9.26 and Â²6.19 and 15.66 (cn138139) Â²7.15 and 12.36 (cn138163) fluoxetine: Â²6.61 and 10.47 (cn138139) Â²6.33 and 12.12 (cn138163) norfluoxetine: Â²8.65 and 16.58 (cn138139) Â²7.29 and 16.90 (cn138163) Â²14.39 and 30.22 (cn138139) Â²12.33 and 23.86 (cn138163) detector settings [ms instrument settings with m/z valuesb or fluorescence wavelengths] electrospray with positive ionisation citalopram 325.3/262.4 citalopram-d4 329.3/266.4 fluorescence excitation wavelength 276 nm and emission wavelength 598 nm electrospray with positive ionisation fluoxetine 310.1/148.1 fluoxetine-d5 315.1/153.3 norfluoxetine 296.3/134.3 norfluoxetine-d5 301.3/139.3 electrospray with positive ionisation paroxetine 330.3/192.6 paroxetine-d6 336.2/198.5 turboionspray with positive ionisation sertraline 306.1/275.2 desmethylsertraline 292.2/159.3 indrataline 292.2/261.1 column: keystone betasil c-8, 2.0 mm _ 50 mm, 5 _m mobile phase a: 0.1% formic sertraline: Â²10.2 and 20.1 (cn138139) acid mobile phase b: methanol gradient at 0.250Ã0.450 ml/min Â²10.69 and 20.08 (cn138163) desmethylsertraline: Â²16.5 and 36.1 (cn138139) Â²10.60 and 36.10 (cn138163) aheights of the analyte and internal standards were required to be Â±70% of the established parameters and retention times were required to be Â±15% of the established parameters for hplc analyses. area ratio between analyte and internal standard was required to be Â±50% of the average of triplicate injections for lc-ms/ms analyses. bfirst m/z value is for initial m/z of parent ion and the second is the transition mass ion being monitored. cwith fluorescence detection. cv%, percentage coefficient of variation;

180	The pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone in healthy volunteers treated with cimetidine or antacid.	To evaluate the effects of cimetidine and Maalox(R) (aluminium hydroxide 1.35 g and magnesium hydroxide 1.2 g) on the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. Eleven healthy young subjects aged 18-45 years were given single oral doses of ziprasidone 40 mg on three occasions at least 7 days apart. On one occasion ziprasidone was administered alone, on another occasion ziprasidone was co-administered with oral cimetidine 800 mg and on a third occasion ziprasidone was co-administered with oral Maalox(R). The administration of cimetidine increased the ziprasidone AUC(0,infinity) by 6% but there were no statistically significant differences in Cmax, tmax or lambda(z) between the ziprasidone+cimetidine group and the ziprasidone group. The administration of Maalox did not produce any statistically significant differences in AUC(0,infinity), Cmax, tmax or lambda(z) between the ziprasidone+Maalox group and the ziprasidone group. The pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone are not affected by concurrent administration of cimetidine or Maalox. This suggests that other nonspecific inhibitors of cytochrome P450 and antacids are unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone.	methods subjects the subjects were healthy, young (18Ã45 years) adults of either gender. all subjects weighed j91 kg and were within 10% of their ideal body weight for age, height, sex and frame [5]. none was pregnant or lactating and none was a smoker. all subjects provided written informed consent. f 2000 blackwell science ltd br j clin pharmacol, 49 (suppl. 1), 57sÃ60s 57s k. d. wilner et al. protocol this was an open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study designed to determine whether multiple doses of cimetidine and maalox1 alter the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone. the study protocol was approved by an independent institutional review board. the study comprised three 1 day treatment periods least 7 days. during each separated by intervals of at treatment period each subject received one of three different treatments in one of six sequences according to a computer-generated randomization. these three treat- ments were: ziprasidone 40 mg alone; ziprasidone 40 mg +cimetidine 800 mg; and ziprasidone 40 mg+maalox1 30 ml (aluminium hydroxide 1.35 g and magnesium hydroxide 1.2 g). ziprasidone hydrochloride capsules were administered orally, after a standard breakfast at approximately 09.00 h. cimetidine tablets were administered once daily, at approximately 07.00 h, commencing 2 days before ziprasidone administration and continuing until 1 day after ziprasidone dosing. maalox1 suspension was admi- nistered on the evening before the administration of ziprasidone (approximately 23.00 h), immediately before the ziprasidone dosing (approximately 09.00 h), and after lunch (approximately 13.00 h) and dinner (approximately 18.00 h) on the day that ziprasidone was taken. pharmacokinetic sampling blood samples for the determination of serum ziprasidone concentrations were collected immediately before dosing and at Ãxed intervals up to 36 h after each dose of ziprasidone. pharmacokinetic analysis serum concentrations of ziprasidone were determined using high performance liquid chromatography involving solid-phase extraction and u.v. detection. the assay had a dynamic range of 1.0Ã250.0 ng mlx 1 [6]. ziprasidone concentrations below the lower limit of quantiÃcation were assigned a value of 0 ng mlx 1 in pharmacokinetic calculations. the maximum serum concentration of ziprasidone (cmax) and the earliest time at which cmax occurred (tmax) were estimated directly from the experimental data. the terminal elimination rate constant for ziprasidone (lz) was estimated using least-squares regression analysis of the ziprasidone concentrationÃtime data obtained during the log-linear phase. the terminal half-life of terminal ln 2/lz, and the ziprasidone (tk,z) was calculated as mean half-life of ziprasidone was estimated as ln 2/mean lz. the area under the serum concentrationÃtime curve from time zero to the last time (t) serum ziprasidone was measurable (auc(0,t)) was estimated by the linear trapezoidal approximation. the area under the serum concentrationÃtime curve from the time t to inÃnity (auc(t,?)) was calculated as cpest/lz, where cpest is the estimated concentration at the last time serum ziprasidone was measurable based on the regression analysis of the terminal log-linear phase. the total area under the serum concentrationÃtime curve (auc(0,?)) was estimated as the sum of the auc(0,t) and auc(t,?) values. statistical analysis log-transformed auc(0,?) and cmax values, natural and untransformed tmax and lz values, were analysed in a two-way analysis of variance (anova) model containing sequence, subject within sequence, period and treatment effects (proc glm of sas1). the sequence effect was tested using the subject within sequence mean square as the error term and the period effect was tested using the within subject mean square error as the error term. geometric means and standard deviations were calcu- lated for auc(0,?) and cmax. arithmetic means and tmax and lz. standard deviations were calculated for adjusted means, and their variances and covariances, were then calculated using the least-squares means statement from sas1. these were then used to estimate the difference between the treatment effects. studentÃs t-tests with 95% conÃdence limits were used to examine pair-wise differences between the groups. values of p<0.05 were considered to be statistically signiÃcant.

181	The role of cytochrome P2C19 in R-warfarin pharmacokinetics and its interaction with omeprazole.	Previous studies reported omeprazole to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and suggested the pharmacokinetic interaction of omeprazole with R-warfarin. The aim of this study was to compare possible effects of omeprazole on the stereoselective pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin between CYP2C19 genotypes. Seventeen subjects, of whom 10 were homozygous extensive metabolizers (hmEMs) and seven were poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, were enrolled in this randomized crossover study, and they ingested 20 mg omeprazole or placebo once daily for 11 days. On day 7, they administered a single dose of 10 mg racemic warfarin. The plasma concentrations of warfarin enantiomers and prothrombin time expressed as international normalized ratio were monitored up to 120 hours. During the placebo phase, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and elimination half-life (t1/2) of R-warfarin in PMs was significantly greater than those in hmEMs (AUC[0-infinity], 42,938/34,613 ng h/mL [PM/hmEM], P = 0.004; t1/2, 48.8/40.8 hours [PM/hmEM], P = 0.013). Omeprazole treatment significantly increased the AUC(0-infinity) (41,387 ng h/mL, P = 0.004) and t1/2 (46.4 hours, P = 0.017) of R-warfarin in hmEMs to levels comparable to those in the PMs. There were no differences in S-warfarin pharmacokinetics between the CYP2C19 genotypes (AUC[0-infinity], 15,851/16,968 ng*h/mL [PM/hmEM]; t1/2, 22.7/25.4 h [PM/hmEM]), or between the two treatment phases (AUC[0-infinity], 14,756/18,166 ng h/mL [PM/hmEM]; t1/2, 27.0/25.4 hours [PM/hmEM] in the omeprazole phase) as well as anticoagulant effects. These results indicate that CYP2C19 activity was one of determinants on the R-warfarin disposition because the pharmacokinetics of warfarin enantiomers were different between the CYP2C19 genotypes and the omeprazole affected the R-warfarin pharmacokinetics of CYP2C19 in only hmEMs. However, the phamacodynamic effect of the interaction of warfarin with omeprazole would be of minor clinical significance.	subjects seventeen healthy japanese volunteers (12 males and five females) consisting of 10 cyp2c19 homozygous ems (hmems) and seven pms were enrolled in this study after giving written informed consent. subjects previously underwent a cyp2c19 genotyping test by use of a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method with allele-specific primer for identifying the cyp2c19 wild-type (*1) gene and the two mutated alleles, cyp2c19*2 (*2) in exon 5 and cyp2c19*3 (*3), in exon 4.11 cyp2c9 genotype was also determined,12 and only cyp2c9*1/*1 subjects were included in the study. the mean (Â± standard deviation) values of age and body weight of the volunteers were 25.5 (Â±1.9) years (range, 23-30 years) and 60.8 (Â±8.5) kg (range, 45-80 kg), respectively. each subject was physically normal by clinical examination and routine laboratory testing and had no history of significant medical illness or hypersensitivity to any drugs. this study was approved by the ethics committee of hirosaki university school of medicine.study protocolsa randomized, double-blind, two-phase (placebo and omeprazole treatment) crossover study with a washout period of at least 2 weeks was carried out. the order of two phases was randomly assigned to each subject: eight subjects (five hmems and three pms) started the placebo phase first and the others did the omeprazole phase first. a capsule containing a 20-mg omeprazole tablet (omepral; astrazeneca co., osaka, japan) or a matched placebo capsule was given orally once daily (at 8 am) for 11 days. on day 7, a single dose of 10 mg racemic warfarin (two 5-mg tablets of warfarin; eisai co. ltd., tokyo, japan) was administered orally at 9 am with tap water after overnight fasting. blood samples for the determination of prothrombin time inr and plasma warfarin enantiomer concentrations were obtained before and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, and 120 hours after dosing. plasma samples were frozen and kept at -20Â¡c until analysis. volunteers did not take any medication or fruit juices for at least 7 days before the study, and no meal or beverages were allowed until 4 hours after drug administration.back to topassayplasma concentrations of warfarin enantiomers were quantitated using the high-performance liquid chromatography method developed in our laboratory.13 in brief, warfarin enantiomers and an internal standard, diclofenac sodium, were extracted from 1 ml of plasma sample using diethyl ether-chloroform (80:20, v/v). the extract was injected onto column i (tsk precolumn bsa-c8, 5 Âµm, 10 mm _ 4.6 mm inside diameter) for cleanup and column ii (chiralcel od-rh analytical column, 150 mm _ 4.6 mm inside diameter) coupled with a guard column (chiralcel od-rh guard column, 10 mm _ 4.6 mm inside diameter) for separation. the mobile phase consisted of phosphate buffer-acetonitrile (84:16 v/v, ph 2.0) for cleanup and phosphate buffer-acetonitrile (45:55 v/v, ph 2.0) for separation. the peaks were monitored with an ultraviolet detector set at a wavelength of 312 nm. the validated concentration ranges of this method were 3 to 1000 ng/ml for r- and s-warfarin, respectively. intra- and interday coefficients of variation were less than 4.4% and 4.9% for r-warfarin and 4.8% and 4.0% for s-warfarin at the different concentrations, respectively. the limit of quantification was 3 ng/ml for warfarin enantiomers. plasma samples for the pharmacokinetic study were stored at -20Â¡c and analyzed within 3 months after sampling, and then were stable at -20Â¡c for 6 months.plasma concentrations of omeprazole and 5-hydroxyomeprazole were quantitated using the high-performance liquid chromatography method developed in our laboratory.14 in brief, after alkalization with 0.1 ml of 0.5 mol/l disodium hydrogen phosphate, 1 ml plasma was extracted with 4 ml of diethyl ether-dichloromethane (55:45, v/v). the organic phase was evaporated at 60Â¡c to dryness. the residue was dissolved with 30 Âµl of methanol and 100 Âµl of 50 mmol/l disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer (ph 9.3), and then a 30-Âµl aliquot was injected to a high-performance liquid chromatography system (shimadzu class-vp; shimadzu corporation, kyoto, japan), with a inertsil ods-80a column as an analytical column (particle size 5 Âµm; gl science inc., tokyo, japan). the mobile phase consisted of phosphate buffer-acetonitrile-methanol (65:30:5 v/v/v, ph6.5). flow rate was 0.8 ml/min and wavelength was set at 302 nm. limit of quantification was 3 ng/ml for omeprazole and 5-hydroxyomeprazole. intra- and interday coefficient variations were less than 5.1% and 6.6% for omeprazole concentrations ranging from 4 to 1600 ng/ml and 4.6% and 5.0% for 5-hydroxyomeprazole concentration ranging from 4 to 400 ng/ml, respectively.back to toppharmacokinetic analysismaximum plasma concentrations (cmax) and the time to reach cmax (tmax) were determined directly from the individual concentration-time data. pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental methods. the terminal elimination rate constant (ke) was obtained by linear regression analysis by use of at least three sampling points of the terminal log-linear declining phase to the last measurable concentration. the apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) was calculated as 0.693 divided by ke. the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) was calculated with use of the trapezoidal rule. auc from zero to infinity (auc[0-[infinity]]) was calculated by auc(0-last) + clast/ke, where clast is last detectable plasma drug concentration. the apparent oral clearance (cl) was calculated by dose/auc(0-[infinity])/weight, where dose is 5 mg for each warfarin enantiomer.back to toppharmacodynamic analysisthe prothrombin time (pt) was monitored and calibrated against a thromboplastin with an international sensitivity index value of 1.0 to calculate pt-inr. the maximum effect (pt-inr max) and time to pt-inr max (pt-inr tmax) for anticoagulant effects of warfarin were obtained directly from the data. the area under the effect time-curve (pt-inr auc0-120h) was calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule.statistical analysisdifferences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two treatment phases and between hmems and pms of cyp2c19 were determined using paired or unpaired t test. a p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. these statistical analyses were analyzed by stat view program (version 5.0; sas institute, cary, nc).

182	The safety and pharmacokinetics of quetiapine when coadministered with haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine.	The effects of haloperidol, risperidone, and thioridazine on the pharmacokinetics and side-effect profile of quetiapine were investigated in 36 patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder in a single-center, two-period, multiple-dose, open-label, randomized trial. Over a one-to two-week period, quetiapine doses were escalated to 300 mg twice daily (bid). Patients were then treated for at least 7 days at the target quetiapine dose and subsequently entered into the combination therapy period, receiving haloperidol (7.5 mg, bid), risperidone (3 mg, bid), or thioridazine (200 mg, bid) for 8.5 days (after 3 days of dose escalation). Key assessments included the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine at steady state (area under the curve within a dosing interval [AUCtSS], maximum [CmaxSS], and minimum [CminSS] observed plasma concentrations, and oral clearance [Cl/f]), as well as the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale scores and safety evaluations. Neither risperidone nor haloperidol had significant effects on quetiapine pharmacokinetics. However, thioridazine produced statistically significant changes, decreasing the least squares means values of the AUCtSS, CmaxSS, and CminSS by 40%, 47%, and 31%, respectively, and increasing Cl/f by 68%. Increases in the following adverse events were noted during coadministration: somnolence (risperidone), insomnia and dry mouth (all three coadministered therapies), and dizziness (thioridazine). UKU side effect items that became worse in >or= 25% of patients during each coadministration period included sedation and increased sleep duration. Results of laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and vital sign measurements revealed few clinically important changes. Clinical stability can be maintained with good tolerability during the transition from quetiapine monotherapy to periods of coadministration with haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine. Coadministration of either haloperidol or risperidone did not have any important effects on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of quetiapine. Thioridazine significantly increased the oral clearance of quetiapine. Increased doses of quetiapine may be necessary to control psychotic symptoms when thioridazine is coadministered with quetiapine.	methods men and women, 18 to 60 years old, with schizophre- nia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder (dsm-iv criteria) were included if they were in clinical remission from acute psychotic exacerbation for at least 3 months at trial entry. female patients were postmenopausal or used approved methods of contraception. previous treat- ment with antipsychotics was a criterion for participa- tion, but use of depot formulations within one dosing in- terval, relative to trial entry, was not permitted. similarly, the use of drugs known to alter or induce metabolic en- zymes, including barbiturates, carbamazepine, or pheny- toin, was not permitted within 6 weeks of trial entry. clin- ically signiÃcant medical conditions that could affect required evaluations or increase the risk of treatment, in- cluding positive tests for substance abuse and history of renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or meta- bolic disease were the primary exclusion criteria. pa- tients were also excluded if they were currently taking clozapine, or any drugs known to affect cyp3a4, within 6 weeks of the beginning of the trial. to minimize intraindividual variability, the following restrictions were imposed. patients agreed to: limit caf- feine; refrain from alcohol; refrain from smoking for 2 hours before recording of vital signs; take only approved medications; refrain from rigorous physical exercise and sunbathing; and refrain from consuming smoked or charcoal-broiled meats, cabbage, cauliÃower, brussel sprouts, broccoli, or grapefruit juice. before patients were enrolled, the trial was approved by the centerÃs institutional review board. after proce- dures and possible adverse events were explained to them, patients or their legal guardians provided consent to participate in the trial. study design the trial was designed as a single-center, multiple- dose, randomized, open-label trial. it consisted of a screening period, during which baseline physical and psychiatric status were evaluated, and two treatment pe- riods (a and b). during period a (days 1a to 14Ã48a), subjects were given quetiapine alone. during period b (days 1bÃ17b), subjects were housed in the clinical research center and initially given quetiapine alone fol- lowed by coadministration with one of three other an- tipsychotics, as determined by randomization. hospital- ization during this period aided medication, as well as diet and activity compliance. study design and treatment pharmacokinetic implications for quetiapine j clin psychopharmacol, vol 22/no 2, april 2002 123 schedules are shown schematically in figure 1. ongoing treatments with antipsychotics other than quetiapine were discontinued the day before period a began. during period a, patients took quetiapine according to a Ãxed dosing schedule, which provided for a starting dose of 25 mg twice daily and dose escalation to 300 mg twice daily (target dose) by day 8a. treatment continued at the target dose at least through day 21a, and was per- mitted through day 49a, if necessary. only patients who were stabilized at the target dose (300 mg twice daily) for at least 7 days entered period b. patients remained at this quetiapine dose through the morning of day 17b. patients began concurrent, randomized treatment with haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine on day 6b, with initial doses increasing through day 8b, according to a Ãxed schedule. from days 9b through 16b, the concomi- tant antipsychotics were dosed as follows: haloperidol, 7.5 mg twice daily; risperidone, 3 mg twice daily, or thio- ridazine, 200 mg twice daily. during period b, doses of quetiapine and the concomitant antipsychotic were given at the same time of day. patients were permitted to take chloral hydrate (500Ã 2000 mg/dose; maximum, 2000 mg/day) for agitation or insomnia because it has no known interaction with que- tiapine. in addition, patients were permitted to take benztropine mesylate (1Ã4 mg orally; 1Ã2 mg parenter- ally) for cause, such as moderate or worsening eps, ac- cording to the simpson-angus scale;13 and lithium, when part of a stable regimen at trial entry. acetamino- phen was permitted for analgesia. blood sampling blood samples for quetiapine assay were taken just before morning doses on days 3b through 5b and on days 15b through 17b to determine quetiapine concen- tration at the end of the nocturnal dosing interval (morn- ing cmin ss) and conÃrm steady-state conditions. during the coadministrations, blood samples were obtained be- fore morning doses on days 5b, 16b, and 17b to deter- ss values for haloperidol, risperidone, mine morning cmin or thioridazine and assess steady-state conditions for these agents. on days 5b and 17b, blood samples were fig. 1. study design and treatment schedule for quetiapine monotherapy and combination therapy with haloperidol, risperidone, or thioridazine. randomization to concomitant therapy occurred on or around day 4b. q, quetiapine; h, haloperidol; r, risperidone; t, thioridazine; bid, twice daily. *patients who did not tolerate dose escalation as prescribed were allowed to extend the escalation period through day 15a. patients who did not reach the target dose of 300 mg bid by that time were withdrawn; Â the duration of period a was determined per patient by the investi- gator; however, once patients received at least 7 consecutive days of quetiapine at the target dose, they were eligible to enter period b; Ã on day 17b, patients received morning doses only. 124 j clin psychopharmacol, vol 22/no 2, april 2002 potkin and associates also collected at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 6, 8, and 12 hours after the morning doses of quetiapine for quetiapine assays. samples for analysis were collected in heparinized tubes and centrifuged at 4_c within 15 to 30 minutes of collection. resultant plasma was transferred to poly- propylene tubes and immediately frozen at _70_c. tubes were stored at _20_c until analyzed. analytical determination the analytical method used to determine quetiapine concentration included alkalinization of plasma, extrac- tion with ethyl acetate, and detection by means of high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with pres- sure, ionization, and tandem mass spectometry. the limit of quantitation was 2.5 ng/ml, with an applicable range to 5000 ng/ml by sample dilution with plasma. samples were analyzed by harris laboratory, lincoln, nebraska. sixty-Ãve runs were conducted for the analysis of que- tiapine and its metabolites. analyses were run by subject as single determinations. out-of-day repeat analysis was conducted for all samples from seven randomly selected subjects (217 samples) and for cause. acceptable impre- cision between duplications was speciÃed to be _15% relative standard deviation (rsd). duplicates with less precision were reanalyzed, given sufÃcient sample quan- tity. the mean overall out-of-day precision for quetiapine was 7.4% rsd. the validated method was demonstrated by monitoring the daily calibration curve response and the results of the spiked-quality control samples (qcs) assayed each day of sample analysis. quality control standards were prepared at 7.50, 175, and 350 ng/ml. an analytical run was accepted if at least two thirds of the quality control concentrations were within _ 20% of the- ory, including at least half of the replicates at each con- centration level. methods for analysis of haloperidol, risperidone, and thioridazine included liquid-liquid extraction and detec- tion by various hplc methods, including hplc with uv detection and internal standard for haloperidol (limit of quantitation, 0.500Ã25.0 ng/ml, pharmaco international inc, richmond, virginia); reversed-phase hplc with uv detection for risperidone (limit of quantitation, 1.00Ã100 ng/ml, zeneca pharmaceuticals, wilmington, delaware); and normal-phase hplc with uv detection for thiorid- azine (limit of quantitation, 5.00Ã1500 ng/ml, phoenix in- ternational life sciences, inc, montreal, quebec). analytical methods were speciÃc against known me- tabolites of the given analyte, common analgesics, ben- ztropine mesylate, and chloral hydrate. in addition, the method used for quetiapine analysis was speciÃc against the other analytes, several benzodiazepines, chlorpro- mazine, Ãuoxetine, and imipramine, while the methods used for the three concomitant agents were speciÃc against quetiapine and its known metabolites. mean overall out-of-day precision was 7.4%, 19.4%, 14.6%, and 7.3% rsd for quetiapine, haloperidol, risperidone, and thioridazine analyses, respectively. pharmacokinetic assessments key pharmacokinetic assessments were based on steady-state plasma concentrations of quetiapine. concentration-versus-time data gathered over a 12-hour dosing interval, after morning doses on days 5b and 17b, were used to determine: maximum observed concentra- tion (cmax ss (tmax), minimum observed ss), area under the curve within a dos- concentration (cmin ing interval (auc_ ss), and oral clearance (cl/f). ss), time to cmax safety assessments in general, safety and tolerability were evaluated from subjective reports of symptomatology and from: sched- uled physical examinations; laboratory tests to deter- mine blood counts (red blood cells, white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets), hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase [ast], alanine aminotrans- ferase [alt], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), renal function (blood urea nitrogen [bun], creatinine, and gamma glutamyl transferase) and serum chemistry; urinalysis; electrocardiographic examination; and vital sign measurements. extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated using the simpson-angus scale (modiÃed to include an akathisia item) on days 2b, 4b, 11b, and 16b. in comparing the relative tolerability of the three treatment combinations with that of quetiapine alone, the uku side effect rating scale14 was the primary measure of tolerability. for each of 21 items (10 psy- chic, 11 autonomic), a change in score of at least 1 point on day 16b, compared with baseline (day 4b) score, was considered a change in symptom severity for any one patient. an increase in the magnitude of the score indi- cated a worsening of the side effect. psychiatric assessments secondary assessments to evaluate psychiatric status were completed on days 2b, 4b, 11b, and 16b, using the 18-item brief psychiatric rating scale ([bprs]; item scoring, 0Ã6) and clinical global impression (cgi) sever- ity of illness item.15,16 pharmacokinetic and statistical considerations power calculations were based on data from a previ- ous pharmacokinetic trial and the assumption of log- normally distributed auct ss. from that, a sample size of 12 patients per combination treatment group was con- sidered sufÃcient to detect a 30% or greater difference in quetiapine auct ss with 90% power and a two- sided signiÃcance level of 0.10 if drug coadministration ss and cmax pharmacokinetic implications for quetiapine j clin psychopharmacol, vol 22/no 2, april 2002 125 introduced a change in these pharmacokinetic parame- ters. additionally, 12 patients per treatment group would provide reliable data for evaluating the effects of drug coadministration as determined by the uku side effect rating scale. pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using noncom- ss, and tmax were de- partmental methods. cmin rived directly from observed data. auc_ ss was computed using the linear trapezoidal rule, and cl/f was calcu- lated as dose/auc_ ss, cmax ss. data from protocol-compliant patients who completed the trial through day 17b and provided blood samples for both phases of pharmacokinetic proÃling were included in the pharmacokinetic analyses. data from all patients who received at least one dose of quetiapine were in- cluded in the safety analyses. ss, auct statistical analyses were performed separately for each combination treatment group. an analysis of variance (anova) model that included terms for patient and day was used to assess the effects of haloperidol, risperidone, ss, or thioridazine on the log-transformed values of cmax ss, and cl/f. tmax was summarized as a median cmin and a range. ninety-percent conÃdence intervals (cis) for the geometric mean ratios (day 17b:day 5b) for cmax ss, cmin ss, and cl/f were constructed based on the re- sults of the anova. intervals not contained within the range 0.70 to 1.43 indicated a statistically signiÃcant effect of the coadministered drug.17 ss, auct anova and regression analysis were also performed separately for each combination treatment group in de- termining morning cmin ss values on days 3b, 4b, and 5b and on days 15b, 16b, and 17b. the anova model in- cluded terms for patient and day. steady state was as- sumed if there were no signiÃcant day effects. the proportion of patients with increased adverse- event severity, as evaluated by the uku side effect rating scale, was determined for each treatment combi- nation as well as for all patients combined. because dif- ferent side effects were anticipated for each treatment combination, intergroup comparisons were not made. the mean score test, a normal approximation test of paired differences with a multinomial distribution, was used to evaluate the differences from baseline for indi- vidual uku items at a signiÃcance level of 0.05. for other safety measures, descriptive statistics were used to sum- marize data. again, intergroup comparisons were not made.

183	Triazolam biotransformation by human liver microsomes in vitro: effects of metabolic inhibitors and clinical confirmation of a predicted interaction with ketoconazole.	Biotransformation of the triazolobenzodiazepine triazolam to its hydroxylated metabolites, alpha-hydroxy (OH)- and 4-OH-triazolam, was studied in vitro using microsomal preparations of human liver. Mean values of Vmax (10.3 nM/min/mg of protein) and Km (304 microM) for the 4-OH pathway exceeded values for the alpha-OH pathway (2.4 and 74, respectively). However the mean Vmax/Km ratios for the two pathways were nearly identical, indicating that both contribute approximately equally to intrinsic clearance. Ketoconazole was a powerful inhibitor of triazolam biotransformation, having mean competitive Ki values of 0.006 and 0.023 microM for the alpha-OH and 4-OH pathways. This is consistent with the role of P450-3A isoforms in mediating triazolam biotransformation. The serotonin2 antagonist antidepressant nefazodone inhibited the alpha-OH and 4-OH pathways (Ki = 0.6 and 1.7 microM, respectively), but with considerably less activity than ketoconazole. Among six selective serotonin reuptake-inhibitor antidepressants, norfluoxetine was the most potent inhibitor (Ki = 2.7 and 8.0 microM) and fluoxetine itself was the weakest (Ki = 7.0 and 44.3 microM). In a double-blind clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study, administration of triazolam (0.125 mg) preceded by ketoconazole, compared to triazolam preceded by placebo, produced a nearly 9-fold reduction in apparent oral clearance of triazolam (41 vs. 337 ml/min) and a 4-fold prolongation of half-life (13.5 vs. 3.4 hr). Pharmacodynamic testing indicated enhancement of electroencephalographic beta activity, and enhanced decrements in digit-symbol substitution test performance, attributable to coadministration of ketoconazole. Plasma ketoconazole concentrations measured in the clinical study ranged from 0.02 microgram/ml (projected minimum) to 4.95 micrograms/ml (maximum). An in vitro-in vivo scaling model, using these plasma ketoconazole concentrations together with liver partition ratios and the in vitro Ki values, predicted a decrement of triazolam clearance due to ketoconazole coadministration that was consistent with the 88% decrement in clearance actually observed in vivo.	methods triaused drug vivo liver vitro ultracentrifugation advancement studies disease

184	Warfarin-fluconazole. II. A metabolically based drug interaction: in vivo studies.	Consistent with expectations based on human in vitro microsomal experiments, administration of fluconazole (400 mg/day) for 6 days to six human volunteers significantly reduced the cytochrome P450 (P450)-dependent metabolic clearance of the warfarin enantiomers. In particular, P4502C9 catalyzed 6- and 7-hydroxylation of (S)-warfarin, the pathway primarily responsible for termination of warfarin's anticoagulant effect, was inhibited by approximately 70%. The change in (S)-warfarin pharmacokinetics caused by fluconazole dramatically increased the magnitude and duration of warfarin's hypoprothrombinemic effect. These observations indicate that co-administration of fluconazole and warfarin will result in a clinically significant metabolically based interaction The major P450-dependent, in vivo pathways of (R)-warfarin clearance were also strongly inhibited by fluconazole. 10-Hydroxylation, a metabolic pathway catalyzed exclusively by P4503A4, was inhibited by 45% whereas 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylations were inhibited by 61, 73, and 88%, respectively. The potent inhibition of the phenolic metabolites suggests that enzymes other than P4501A2 (weakly inhibited by fluconazole in vitro) are primarily responsible for the formation of these metabolites in vivo as predicted from in vitro kinetic studies. These data suggest that fluconazole can be expected to interact with any drug whose clearance is dominated by P450s 2C9, 3A4, and other as yet undefined isoforms. Overall, the results strongly support the hypothesis that metabolically based in vivo drug interactions may be predicted from human in vitro microsomal data.	materials and methodschemicals and materials. pseudoracemic wanfarin containing equalamounts of (s)-4Ã-deuteriowarfatin and unlabeled (r)-warfanin was prepared for oral dosing as described previously (6). pentadeutenio analogs of thewarfanin metabolites were prepared as described previously (10). fluconazolewas obtained as a gift from pfizer, inc. (new york, ny). a-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-lh-imidazole-l-ethanol was purchased from janssen chimica phanmaceutica(piscataway, nj).assay for fluconazole by hplc. one-ml aliquots of selected plasmasamples containing fluconazole were spiked with internal standard, a-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-ih-imidazole-l-ethanol (100 pi of a 700 Ãµg/ml solution),made basic with 1.0 ml of 1 n koh and twice extracted with 3 ml of ethylacetate. the combined organic layers were back-extracted with 2.0 ml of 1 nhc1. the aqueous layer was made basic with 1.75 ml of 1.0 n koh and twiceextracted with 3.0 ml ethyl acetate. the combined organic layers were evaporatedto dryness under a stream of dry nitrogen. the residue was dissolved in100 m1 of a 1: 1 mixture of 10 mm ammonium phosphate (ph 9.0) andacetonitnile for analysis. fluconazole concentrations were measured by gradientelution hplc at a flow rate of 0.5 mi/rain using a hewlett-packard series1050 chromatograph and a c18 3.0 Ãµm microsorb (4.6 mm id. x 15 cm;rainin instruments, woburn, ma) column with the uv detector set at 260 nm.the peak areas of analyte relative to internal standard were used to quantifylevels of analyte. sample volumes of 20 Ãµl were injected into an initial mobilephase composition of 10% acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium phosphate buffer(ph 9.0). one mm after sample injection, a 15-mm gradient to a final compositionof 60% acetonitnile was initiated. this solvent composition wasmaintained for an additional 2 mm at the end of the run. the intersamplecolumn reequilibration time was 9 rain. a linear (r2 = >0.98) standard curvewas constructed using blank plasma spiked with 6 concentrations of fluconazoleover the expected range of plasma levels (12-40 ,.Ãµg/ml). the retentiontimes of fluconazole and internal standard were 7 and 9 rain, respectively.clinical protocol the study population consisted of six healthy, nonsmoking,paid, male volunteers. the mean age and weight were 25.5 years (range =23-29) and 75.1 kg (range = 68.2-81.8), respectively. none of the subjectshad taken any other drugs during the month preceding the study, except anoccasional acetaminophen (2 subjects), aspirin (1 subject), and ibuprofen (1subject) for headache. each subject received a prestudy screening physicalexamination, urinalysis, and laboratory examination for determination of serumelectrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, ast, alt, alkaline phosphatase,bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, cell blood count with differentialplatelet count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. no medications (includingaspirin and alcohol) other than study drugs were allowed during the 6-weekstudy period. subjects were fully informed of the nature and risk of the study,and each signed an informed consent form approved by the university ofwashington human subjects review committee. subjects were treated asoutpatients.the study was divided into two phases: phase i (days 1-8, control) andphase 2 (days 29-42, fluconazole 400 mg/day), with a 21-day washout periodbetween phases. on day 1, each subject was administered a single dose of 0.75mg/kg pseudoracemic warfanin with 200 ml of water at 8 a.m. blood samples,15 ml, were obtained by venipuncture before warfanin administration, and at 2,6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hr thereafter. urine was collected in timed,12-hr intervals (0-12, 12-24 156-168) for 7 days after warfarin administration.on day 29, each subject began a 14-day regimen of oral fluconazole,400 mg daily, at approximately 9 a.m. on day 35, a second oral dose ofpseudoracemic warfanin (0.75 mg/kg) was administered, and urine and bloodsamples were collected exactly as described for phase 1. all plasma and urinesamples were stored at -20#{176}c until further workup. to rapidly reestablishnormal clotting times, all subjects received phytonadione 10 mg orally for 3days at the conclusion of the study (day 42).prothrombin time measurements. except for the washout period, theone-stage prothrombin activity was determined daily beginning at day 0 bymeans of the quick method, as described previously by oÃreilly and aggeler( 1 1).assay for warfarin enantlomers and metabolites. the extraction andgc/ms assay methods for the measurement of the wanfarin enantiomers andtheir metabolites in plasma and urine were conducted as described previously(5), except that lo-hydroxywanfanin levels were also measured. lo-hydnoxywarfaninwas measured as its 4-methoxy, lo-tnimethylsilyloxy derivative (12).pharmacokinetic treatment of data. the plasma concentration-time datafor (r)- and (s)-wanfanin were described adequately in all subjects using a single-compartment model. the elimination rate constants (k) were obtainedby linear regression analysis and auc by the trapezoid rule. cl for theindividual enantiomers of dose (d) was calculated according to cl = fd/auc, where f is the bioavailability and is assumed to be unity as reportedpreviously (13). the apparent volume of distribution (vd) and eliminationhalf-life (t#{189}) were calculated according to vd = f . dik . auc and tvÃµln2/k, respectively. clfÃµs for the various metabolites were calculated accordingto cl1 = fÃµ, . cl, where fm Ãµ5 the fraction of the dose recovered in the urineas a specific metabolite.data analysis. comparative data are expressed as mean Â± sd or se.because each subject served as his own control, the significance of differenceswas assessed by studentÃs t test for paired observations, with significanceassigned at p < 0.05 (14).
