16514303,Pharmacokinetic interaction between nelfinavir and pravastatin in HIV-seronegative volunteers: ACTG Study A5108.,"Nelfinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor with numerous drug-drug interactions, is associated with dyslipidemia. Pravastatin is the preferred statin prescribed for HIV-associated dyslipidemia. To examine the effect of nelfinavir on pravastatin pharmacokinetics. Open-label study in healthy HIV-seronegative adults conducted at the AIDS Clinical Trials Group sites in the United States. Subjects received pravastatin 40 mg daily and underwent intensive sampling for pharmacokinetics on day 3. Subjects took only nelfinavir 1250 mg twice daily on days 4-12. On days 13-15, subjects continued nelfinavir and reinitiated pravastatin. Plasma samples were collected over 24 h for the calculation of pravastatin area under the conce+C2ntration-time curve for 0-24 h on days 3 and 16. Data from 14 subjects with complete pharmacokinetic samples were available for analysis. The median within-subject percentage change in pravastatin AUC was a decrease of 46.5%. Pravastatin maximum plasma concentrations were also lower when pravastatin was administered with nelfinavir. Median values for the maximum pl+C5asma concentrations were 27.9 and 12.4 ng/ml for days 3 and 16, respectively, and the median within-subject decrease was 40.1%. Coadministration of pravastatin and nelfinavir led to a substantial reduction in pravastatin plasma concentrations. Higher doses of pravastatin may need to be prescribed in order to achieve optimal lipid-lowering activity.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials, methods aids clinical trials group actg study a5108 phase open label multiple dose pharmacokinetic drug interaction study primary objectives examine effect efavirenz pharmacokinetics pravastatin atorvastatin simvastatin effect nfv pharmacokinetics pravastatin efavirenz_statin interactions recently published data presented address effect nfvon pharmacokinetics pravastatin time study design nfv commonly prescribed pi antiretroviral naive patients subjects healthy hiv seronegative volunteers recruited planned sample size subjects subjects complete pharmacokinetics evaluations replaced subjects accrued nfv arm august december study design subjects self administered pravastatin mg daily morning first days fourth day pravastatin administered observation blood samples obtained drug administration well h administration pravastatin pharmacokinetics days subjects took nfv mg twice daily meals days subjects continued nfv restarted pravastatin morning dose nfv day pravastatin nfv doses administered observation samples collected h pravastatin pharmacokinetics fasting serum total cholesterol triglycerides high density lipoprotein concentrations measured baseline days using standard enzymatic assays low density lipoprotein ldl calculated using friedewald equation adherence study medications measured using pill counts questionnaires human subjects committees participating institution division aids national institute allergy infectious diseases approved study informed consent obtained subjects pravastatin assay samples pravastatin plasma concentrations analyzed advion biosciences inc ithaca new york usa previously published statistical analyses primary endpoint pravastatin auc h coadministration nfv values auc estimated according linear trapezoidal rule implemented using macro written sas version sas institute cary north carolina usa extrapolation beyond dosing interval maximum plasma concentration cmax defined maximum concentration observed throughout dosing interval also analyzed statistically h concentrations study day samples unavailable given subject pharmacokinetics parameters calculated wilcoxon signed rank test applied within subject differences auc cmax values used test null hypothesis difference pravastatin exposure initiation nfv versus dosing steady state values cmax interest high plasma concentrations statins may associated toxicity pravastatin exposure taken nfv relative taken alone median within subject differences confidence intervals ci around geometric mean ratios reported last recommended us food drug administration evaluate bioequivalence drug interactions,,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
19033449,Enantioselectivity in the pharmacokinetic interaction between fluvastatin and lercanidipine in healthy volunteers.,"Hypertension and dyslipidemia are independent risk factors for cardiovascular mortality and are frequently present in the same patient. Fluvastatin (FV), used to reduce cholesterol levels, and lercanidipine (LER), used to control blood pressure, are marketed as racemic mixtures. Therapeutic activities are 30-fold higher for (+)-3R, 5S-FV and 100- to 200-fold higher for S-LER compared with their respective antipodes. The present study describes the enantioselective pharmacokinetic interaction between LER and FV in healthy volunteers. A crossover randomized study was conducted in 3 phases on 8 volunteers treated with a single oral racemic dose of LER (20 mg) or FV (40 mg) or LER plus FV. Serial blood samples were collected from 0 to 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of the LER and FV enantiomers were determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using the WinNonlin software. The Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests (P < .05) were used to analyze enantiomer ratios and the pharmacokinetic drug interaction. Data are expressed as medians. In monotherapy, the kinetic disposition of both FV and LER was enantioselective. AUC values were significantly higher for (-)-3S,5R-FV than for (+)-3R,5S-FV (358.20 vs 279.68 ng.h/mL) and for S-LER compared with R-LER (13.90 vs 11.88 ng.h/mL). The pharmacokinetic parameters of FV were not enantioselective when combined with LER (AUC: (-)-3S,5R-FV: 325.21; (+)-3R,5S-FV: 316.44 ng.h/mL). There was a significant reduction in S-LER (8.06 vs 13.90 ng.h/mL) and R-LER (6.76 vs 11.88 ng.h/mL) AUC values when FV was coadministered. In conclusion, the interaction between FV-LER might be clinically relevant because AUC values of (+)-3R,5S-FV were increased when LER was coadministered, and AUC values of the 2 LER enantiomers were reduced when FV was coadministered.",DDI Randomized clinical trials, patients methods eight healthy female volunteers ranging age years median confidence interval ci weighing kg median body mass index

10587283,Pharmacokinetic interaction of fluvoxamine and thioridazine in schizophrenic patients.,"This study investigated to what extent fluvoxamine affects the pharmacokinetics of thioridazine (THD) in schizophrenic patients under steady-state conditions. Concentrations of THD, mesoridazine, and sulforidazine were measured in plasma samples obtained from 10 male inpatients, aged 36 to 78 years, at three different time points: A, during habitual monotherapy with THD at 88 +/-54 mg/day; B, after addition of a low dosage of fluvoxamine (25 mg twice a day) for 1 week; and C, 2 weeks after fluvoxamine discontinuation. After the addition of fluvoxamine, THD concentrations relative to time point A significantly increased approximately threefold from 0.40 to 1.21 micromol/L (225%) (p < 0.002), mesoridazine concentrations increased from 0.65 to 2.0 micromol/L (219%) (p < 0.004), and sulforidazine levels increased from 0.21 to 0.56 micromol/L (258%) (p < 0.004). The THD-mesoridazine and THD-sulforidazine ratios remained unchanged during the study. Mean plasma THD, mesoridazine, and sulforidazine levels decreased at time point C, but despite fluvoxamine discontinuation for 2 weeks, three patients continued to exhibit elevated concentrations of THD and its metabolites. In conclusion, fluvoxamine markedly interferes with the metabolism of THD, probably at the CYP2C19 and/or CYP1A2 enzyme level. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the potential for a clinical drug interaction between both compounds, and careful monitoring of THD levels is valuable to prevent the accumulation of the drug and resulting toxicity.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials, methods patients ten male inpatients six smokers four nonsmokers met dsm iv diagnostic criteria schizophrenia participated study

21876043,Pharmacokinetics of voriconazole administered concomitantly with fluconazole and population-based simulation for sequential use.,"In clinical practice, antifungal therapy may be switched from fluconazole to voriconazole; such sequential use poses the potential for drug interaction due to cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19)-mediated inhibition of voriconazole metabolism. This open-label, randomized, two-way crossover study investigated the effect of concomitant fluconazole on voriconazole pharmacokinetics in 10 subjects: 8 extensive metabolizers and 2 poor metabolizers of CYP2C19. The study consisted of 4-day voriconazole-only and 5-day voriconazole-plus-fluconazole treatments, separated by a 14-day washout. Voriconazole pharmacokinetics were determined by noncompartmental analyses. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed in Simcyp (Simcyp Ltd., Sheffield, United Kingdom) to predict the magnitude of drug interaction should antifungal therapy be switched from fluconazole to voriconazole, following various simulated lag times for the switch. In CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers, fluconazole increased the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of voriconazole by 57% and 178%, respectively. In poor metabolizers, however, voriconazole pharmacokinetics were unaffected by fluconazole. The simulations based on pharmacokinetic modeling predicted that if voriconazole was started 6, 12, 24, or 36 h after the last dose of fluconazole, the voriconazole AUC ratios (sequential therapy versus voriconazole only) after the first dose would be 1.51, 1.41, 1.28, and 1.14, respectively. This suggests that the remaining systemic fluconazole would result in a marked drug interaction with voriconazole for _ 24 h. Although no safety issues were observed during coadministration, concomitant use of fluconazole and voriconazole is not recommended. Frequent monitoring for voriconazole-related adverse events is advisable if voriconazole is used sequentially after fluconazole.",DDI Randomized clinical trials, materials methods study design open

23876492,Clinical and pharmacogenetic predictors of circulating atorvastatin and rosuvastatin concentrations in routine clinical care.,"A barrier to statin therapy is myopathy associated with elevated systemic drug exposure. Our objective was to examine the association between clinical and pharmacogenetic variables and statin concentrations in patients. In total, 299 patients taking atorvastatin or rosuvastatin were prospectively recruited at an outpatient referral center. The contribution of clinical variables and transporter gene polymorphisms to statin concentration was assessed using multiple linear regression. We observed 45-fold variation in statin concentration among patients taking the same dose. After adjustment for sex, age, bo+C11dy mass index, ethnicity, dose, and time from last dose, SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (P<0.001) and ABCG2 c.421C>A (P<0.01) were important to rosuvastatin concentration (adjusted R(2)=0.56 for the final model). Atorvastatin concentration was associated with SLCO1B1 c.388A>G (P<0.01) and c.521T>C (P<0.05) and 4_-hydroxycholesterol, a CYP3A activity marker (adjusted R(2)=0.47). A second cohort of 579 patients from primary and specialty care databases were retrospectively genotyped. In this cohort, genotypes associated with statin concentration were not differently distributed among dosing groups, implying providers had not yet optimized each patient's risk-benefit ratio. Nearly 50% of patients in routine practice taking the highest doses were predicted to have statin concentrations greater than the 90th percentile. Interindividual variability in statin exposure in patients is associated with uptake and efflux transporter polymorphisms. An algorithm incorporating genomic and clinical variables to avoid high atorvastatin and rosuvastatin levels is described; further study will determine whether this approach reduces incidence of

18408565,The effect of SLCO1B1*15 on the disposition of pravastatin and pitavastatin is substrate dependent: the contribution of transporting activity changes by SLCO1B1*15.,"This study was addressed to understand the underlying mechanism of the substrate-dependent effect of genetic variation in SLCO1B1, which encodes OATP1B1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide) transporter, on the disposition of two OATP1B1 substrates, pravastatin and pitavastatin, in relation to their transport activities. The uptake of pravastatin, pitavastatin, and fluvastatin was measured in oocytes overexpressing SLCO1B1*1a and SLCO1B1*15 to compare the alterations of in-vitro transporting activity. After 40-mg pravastatin or 4-mg pitavastatin was administered to 11 healthy volunteers with homozygous genotypes of SLCO1B1*1a/*1a and SLCO1B1*15/*15, the pharmacokinetic parameters of pravastatin and pitavastatin were compared among participants with SLCO1B1*1a/*1a and SLCO1B1*15/*15 genotypes. The uptake of pravastatin and pitavastatin in SLCO1B1*15 overexpressing oocytes was decreased compared with that in SLCO1B1*15, but no change occurred with fluvastatin. The fold change of in-vitro intrinsic clearance (Clint) for pitavastatin in SLCO1B1*15 compared with SLCO1B1*1a was larger than that of pravastatin (P<0.0001). The clearance (Cl/F) of pitavastatin was decreased to a greater degree in participant with SLCO1B1*15/*15 compared with that of pravastatin in vivo (P<0.01), consistent with in-vitro study. As a result, Cmax and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of these nonmetabolized substrates were increased by SLCO1B1*15 variant. The greater decrease in the transport activity for pitavastatin in SLCO1B1*15 variant compared with SLCO1B1*1a was, however, associated with the greater effect on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin compared with pravastatin in relation to the SLCO1B1 genetic polymorphism. This study suggests that substrate dependency in the consequences of the SLCO1B1*15 variant could modulate the effect of SLCO1B1 polymorphism on the disposition of pitavastatin and

12603176,"Investigation of the mutual pharmacokinetic interactions between bosentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, and simvastatin.","In vitro, bosentan has been shown to be a mild inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and 3A4. To investigate in vivo the mutual pharmacokinetic interactions between bosentan and simvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Nine healthy male subjects were treated in a three-period randomised crossover study with: (A) bosentan 125 mg twice daily for 5.5 days; (B) simvastatin 40 mg once daily for 6 days; and (C) bosentan 125 mg twice daily and simvastatin 40 mg once daily for 5.5 and 6 days, respectively. Plasma concentration-time profiles of bosentan and its metabolites (treatments A and C) and simvastatin and beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin (treatments B and C) were determined on day 6. Steady-state conditions for bosentan and its metabolites were attained on day 4 of treatment. The pharmacokinetic parameters of bosentan and its metabolites were not influenced by concomitant treatment with simvastatin: areas under the plasma concentration-time curve over one administration interval of 12 hours (AUC(tau)) [geometric mean and 95% CI] were 4586 (3719-5656) and 4928 (3945-6156) micro g * h/L. In contrast, bosentan significantly reduced exposure to simvastatin and beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin by 34 and 46%, respectively. AUC(tau) values for simvastatin were 30.5 (23.1-40.2) and 20.0 (15.9-25.1) micro g * h/L and for beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin 43.0 (32.1-57.8) and 23.4 (16.7-32.6) micro g * h/L in treatments B and C, respectively. Concomitant treatment with bosentan reduces the exposure to simvastatin and beta-hydroxyacid simvastatin by approximately 40%, indicating that in vivo bosentan is also a mild inducer of CYP3A4.",DDI

20081064,An evaluation of the early pharmacodynamic response after simultaneous initiation of warfarin and amiodarone.,"Amiodarone inhibits the metabolism of warfarin. Previous studies characterizing this drug interaction have focused on the effect of adding amiodarone to stable doses of warfarin. The objective of this study was to assess whether simultaneous initiation of warfarin and amiodarone results in early alteration of the international normalized ratio (INR) response to warfarin. Patients initiated on warfarin and amiodarone during the same hospitalization were included in the amiodarone (AMIO) group. Patients initiated on warfarin alone (n = 42) were identified for the CONTROL group. The AMIO and CONTROL groups were matched based on age, gender, and ejection fraction <40% using propensity score matching (final n = 18 patients per group). Total and average daily warfarin dose was lower in the AMIO group, yet INR values were similar on each day between the 2 groups. More patients in the AMIO group had an INR greater than 2 during the 5-day observation period as compared to the CONTROL group. In addition, there were trends toward greater deviation from INR values expected with a 5-mg daily warfarin dose among AMIO group patients. Simultaneous initiation of warfarin and amiodarone leads to an enhanced pharmacodynamic response to warfarin early in therapy. Although these data should be viewed as hypothesis generating, cautious dosing and monitoring with simultaneous initiation of warfarin and amiodarone may be warranted.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials, age gender ejection fraction ef matching carried freely available r software Ì_matchitÌ_ package www r project org comparisons made matched groups several comparisons made groups characterize onset amiodarone warfarin drug interaction mean daily warfarin dose mean daily inr change inr evaluation period percent patients achieving inr value å_2 observation period compared groups surrogate measure Ì_unpredictable responseÌ_ warfarin percentage patients exceeding maximum inr value predicted crowther nomogram daily warfarin dose mg compared groups deviation nomogram crowther nomogram dosing early pd response initiation warfarin amiodarone drug interactions tool used initiation warfarin 12 based initial 5 mg dose warfarin nomogram helps characterize patient s pharmacodynamic response provides guidance dosage adjustments deviation nomogram defined inr greater day therapy inr greater day therapy inr greater day therapy inr limits defined Ì_deviationÌ_ exceeding inr values suggests warfarin dose reduced less mg rate deviation nomogram compared groups time observation period well individual day observation period statistical analysis continuous data presented mean  standard deviation categorical data presented percent continuous data compared amio control groups student test fischer s exact test used compare categorical variables groups log rank test used compare mean time deviation crowther nomogram,,DDI Non-randomized clinical trials,DDI Non-randomized clinical trials
15980690,"Effect of efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin: results of AIDS Clinical Trials Group 5108 Study.","Efavirenz (EFV) is associated with hyperlipidemia when used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. EFV is a mixed inducer/inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isozyme and may interact with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors that are primarily metabolized via CYP3A4. To assess the drug-drug interaction of EFV used in combination with simvastatin (SIM), atorvastatin (ATR), or pravastatin (PRA), an open-label trial was conducted in 52 healthy adult HIV-seronegative subjects across AIDS Clinical Trials Group sites in the United States. Subjects received 40 mg of SIM, 10 mg of ATR, or 40 mg of PRA daily on days 0 through 3 and days 15 through 18. EFV was administered daily at a dose of 600 mg on days 4 through 18. SIM, ATR, and PRA concentrations were determined before and after EFV, and EFV concentrations were determined before and after statins. EFV reduced SIM acid exposure (area under the curve at 0 to 24 hours [AUC0-24 h]) by 58% (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P=0.003) and active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity by 60% (P<0.001). EFV reduced ATR exposure by 43% (P<0.001) and the total active ATR exposure by 34% (P=0.005). EFV administration resulted in a 40% decrease in PRA exposure (P=0.005). SIM, ATR, and PRA had no effect on non-steady-state EFV concentrations. In conclusion, EFV, when administered with SIM, ATR, or PRA, can result in significant induction of statin metabolism. The reduced inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity during coadministration of EFV may result in diminished antilipid efficacy at usual doses of SIM, ATR, and PRA.",DDI Non-randomized clinical

21628604,Valproate reduces the glucuronidation of asenapine without affecting asenapine plasma concentrations.,"Asenapine is indicated for treatment of schizophrenia in the United States and acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes, as monotherapy (United States and European Union) or adjunct therapy (United States only), associated with bipolar I disorder. It is extensively metabolized; the 2 main metabolites are asenapine N-glucuronide and N-desmethyl-asenapine. The authors investigated the pharmacokinetic interactions between asenapine and valproate in an open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study. Twenty-four healthy male volunteers received sublingual doses of asenapine 5 mg alone or under steady-state valproate (500 mg bid for 9 days). Blood samples collected until 72 hours postdosing were analyzed for asenapine, N-desmethyl-asenapine, and asenapine N-glucuronide. Compared with asenapine alone, valproate substantially reduced N-glucuronide formation (area under the curve from 0 to infinity [AUC(0-¡)] reduced 7.4-fold, maximum concentration [C(max)] reduced 6.6-fold) and moderately reduced N-desmethyl-asenapine formation (AUC(0-¡) reduced 30%, C(max) unchanged). Coadministration of valproate did not affect asenapine AUC(0-¡) and C(max) (confidence intervals for the ratios of asenapine AUC(0-¡) and C(max) were contained within the predefined 0.80-1.25 acceptance range). Low-dose valproate, although almost completely inhibiting glucuronidation of asenapine, did not affect the pharmacokinetics of asenapine itself, the entity primarily responsible for the pharmacologic

23334403,Almorexant effects on CYP3A4 activity studied by its simultaneous and time-separated administration with simvastatin and atorvastatin.,"To characterise further the previously observed cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) interaction of the dual orexin receptor antagonist almorexant. Pharmacokinetic interactions were investigated (n_=_14 healthy male subjects in two treatment groups) between almorexant at steady-state when administered either concomitantly or 2 h after administration of single doses of simvastatin (40 mg) or atorvastatin (40 mg). Almorexant dose-dependently increased simvastatin exposure (AUC0-¡) when administered concomitantly [geometric mean ratios (90 % CI): 2.5 (2.1, 2.9) (100 mg), 3.9 (3.3, 4.6) (200 mg)], but not Cmax [3.7 (3.0, 4.5) for both doses]. Time-separated administration resulted in relevant reductions of the interaction [AUC0-¡: 1.4 (1.2, 1.7) (100 mg), 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) (200 mg); Cmax: 1.5 (1.3, 1.9) (100 mg), 1.9 (1.6, 2.4) (200 mg)]. Similar results were obtained for hydroxyacid simvastatin. Independent of almorexant dose and relative time of administration, AUC0-¡ and Cmax of atorvastatin increased (ratios ranged from 1.1 to 1.5). AUC0-¡ and Cmax of o-hydroxy atorvastatin decreased dose-independently [AUC0-¡: 0.8 (0.8, 0.9) (100 mg), 0.6 (0.5, 0.6) (200 mg); Cmax: 0.3 (0.3, 0.4) (100 mg), 0.2 (0.2, 0.3) (200 mg)] when atorvastatin was concomitantly administered. Cmax of o-hydroxy atorvastatin slightly decreased (0.8 for both doses) following time-separated administration; AUC0-¡ was unchanged. Whereas almorexant increased simvastatin exposure dose- and relative time of administration-dependently, atorvastatin exposure increased to a smaller extent and irrespective of dose and time. This suggests that the observed interaction of almorexant with simvastatin is mainly caused by intestinal CYP3A4 inhibition, whereas the interaction with atorvastatin is more due to hepatic CYP3A4 inhibition.",DDI Non-randomized with parallel group design clinical trials, methods subjects total male subjects two treatment groups n 14 planned enrolled order evaluable subjects per treatment group

22472994,Gemfibrozil is a strong inactivator of CYP2C8 in very small multiple doses.,"Therapeutic doses of gemfibrozil cause mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2C8 via formation of gemfibrozil 1-O-_-glucuronide. We investigated the extent of CYP2C8 inactivation caused by three different doses of gemfibrozil twice dailyfor 5 days, using repaglinide as a probe drug, in 10 healthy volunteers. At the end of this 5-day regimen, there were dose-dependent increases in the area under the plasma concentration_time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0_¡) of repaglinide by3.4-, 5.5-, and 7.0-fold corresponding to 30, 100, and 600 mg of gemfibrozil, respectively, as compared with the control phase (P < 0.001). On the basis of a mechanism-based inactivation model involving gemfibrozil 1-O-_-glucuronide, a gemfibrozil dose of 30 mg twice daily was estimated to inhibit CYP2C8 by >70% and 100 mg twice daily was estimated to inhibit it by >90%. Hence, gemfibrozil is a strong inactivator of CYP2C8 even in very small, subtherapeutic, multiple doses. Administration of small gemfibrozil doses may be useful in optimizing the pharmacokinetics of CYP2C8 substrate drugs and in reducing the formation of their potentially toxic metabolites via CYP2C8.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials, many significant drugÌ¡drug interactions caused mechanism based inhibition cytochrome p450 cyp enzymes mechanism based inhibitors inactivate victim enzymes permanently enzyme activity regained de novo synthesis enzyme 1 therefore mechanism based inhibition cause long lasting decrease enzyme activity lead significant changes concentrations drugs metabolized enzyme concerned gemfibrozil inhibitor cyp2c8 vivo 2 3 inhibitory effect based mechanism based inactivation cyp2c8 metabolite gemfibrozil 1 o _ glucuronide 4 5 although drugÌµs metabolites often contribute cyp enzyme inhibiting effects uncommon phase ii metabolite significantly inhibits cyp enzymes 6 therapeutic doses gemfibrozil i e mg twice daily cyp2c8 dependent metabolism drugs shown decrease drastically 3 7Ì¡10 gemfibrozil recommended us food drug administration european medicines agency model inhibitor cyp2c8 vivo studies 11 12 cyp2c8 accounts hepatic cyp content13 significantly expressed small intestine enterocytes 14 contributes metabolism several important drugs e g paclitaxel cerivastatin rosiglitazone repaglinide amiodarone amodiaquine montelukast 3 7 8 15Ì¡17 antidiabetes agent repaglinide recommended food drug administration european medicines agency probe drug studying cyp2c8 activity 11 12 formation repaglinideÌµs main metabolite m2 even formation m4 largely dependent cyp2c8 18Ì¡20 pharmacokinetic variables repaglinide metabolites reflect hepatic cyp2c8 activity 21Ì¡25 also genetic variability slco1b1 gene encoding organic anionÌ¡transporting polypeptide 1b1 oatp1b1 coadministration drugs affecting oatp1b1 and or cyp3a4 may slightly alter pharmacokinetics repaglinide 20 26Ì¡28 aim present study investigate extent inhibition cyp2c8 activity different doses gemfibrozil using repaglinide probe drug achieve healthy volunteers given single dose repaglinide pretreatment mg gemfibrozil placebo twice daily four phase randomized crossover study,,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,DDI Non-randomized clinical trials
22348256,Decrease in the oral bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate after co-medication with rifampicin.,"This study examined the effects of the CYP3A/P-glycoprotein inducer, rifampicin, on the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran following oral administration of the prodrug, dabigatran etexilate. This was an open-label, fixed-sequence, four-period study in healthy volunteers. Subjects received a single dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg on day 1, rifampicin 600 mg once daily on days 2-8, and single doses of dabigatran etexilate on days 9, 16 and 23. Twenty-four subjects were treated, of whom 22 received all treatments. Relative to the reference (single dose of dabigatran etexilate alone; treatment A), administration of dabigatran etexilate following 7 days of rifampicin (treatment B) decreased the geometric mean (gMean) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-¡)) and maximal plasma concentration (C(max)) of total dabigatran by 67 and 65.5%, respectively. The time to peak and the terminal half-life were not affected. The gMean ratio for the primary comparison (treatment B vs. treatment A) was 33.0% (90% confidence interval 26.5, 41.2%) for AUC(0-¡) and 34.5% (90% confidence interval 26.9, 44.1%) for C(max), indicating a significant effect on total dabigatran exposure (total pharmacologically active dabigatran represents the sum of nonconjugated dabigatran and dabigatran glucuronide). After a 7 day (treatment C) or 14 day washout (treatment D), the AUC(0-¡) and C(max) of dabigatran were reduced by 18 and 20%, and by 15 and 20%, respectively, compared with treatment A, which was considered not clinically relevant. The overall safety profile of all treatments was good. Administration of rifampicin for 7 days resulted in a significant reduction in the bioavailability of dabigatran, which returned almost to baseline after 7 days washout.",DDI Non-randomized clinical

16321618,Cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor itraconazole affects plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone in schizophrenic patients.,"Despite the belief that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 alone is responsible for the metabolism of risperidone, several studies suggest that CYP3A may be involved. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of itraconazole, a CYP3A inhibitor, on the plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone in schizophrenic patients in relation to CYP2D6 genotype. Nineteen schizophrenic patients treated with 2 to 8 mg/d of risperidone received 200 mg/d of itraconazole for a week. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured immediately before and after itraconazole treatment, as well as at 1 week after itraconazole treatment was stopped, together with clinical assessment by use of the Udvalg for Kliniske UndersÀgelser Side Effect Rating Scale and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Dose-normalized plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone before itraconazole treatment (0.9 +/- 0.8 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1) and 6.9 +/- 3.3 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1), respectively) were significantly elevated after itraconazole treatment (1.6 +/- 1.3 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1) and 11.3 +/- 4.5 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1)) and decreased 1 week after its discontinuation (1.0 +/- 0.8 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1) and 7.2 +/- 3.7 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1)) (P < .01). However, the ratio of risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone, an index of CYP2D6 activity, did not differ before itraconazole treatment (0.14 +/- 0.13), after itraconazole treatment (0.15 +/- 0.13), and 1 week after discontinuation (0.14 +/- 0.13) (P > .05). Itraconazole increased the concentrations of risperidone by 69% (P < .001) and 75% (P < .01) in CYP2D6 extensive and poor metabolizers, respectively. In addition, the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) also increased similarly, by 71% (P < .001) and 73% (P < .05), respectively, with itraconazole, without a significant difference between CYP2D6 genotypes. The scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale decreased significantly but only by 6% after itraconazole treatment (P < .05); however, the scores on the Udvalg for Kliniske UndersÀgelser Side Effect Rating Scale were not changed. Our results provide in vivo evidence of the involvement of CYP3A in the disposition of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. In addition to CYP2D6, treatment with CYP3A inhibitor(s) including itraconazole may influence clinical symptoms and risperidone side effects.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials, methods study population subjects korean schizophrenic inpatients men women fulfilled criteria schizophrenia according diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders fourth edition american psychiatric association mean age body weight  sd years kg respectively eleven patients smokers  cigarettes per day none heavy drinker study approved local ethics committee yangsan psychiatric hospital yangsan korea written informed consent participate study obtained patients families study design patients received risperidone treatment months enrollment study subjects received mg risperidone mean sd mg per day pm elimination half lives risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone reported hours hours respectively 4 therefore plasma concentrations risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone already reached steady state subjects study initiated female patients taking oral contraceptives doses coadministered drugs fixed throughout study period itraconazole mg d day pm administered subjects week withdrawn week blood sampling performed itraconazole treatment morning dose week discontinuation days blood sampling severity illness side effects evaluated use brief psychiatric rating scale20 udvalg kliniske unders gelser uku side effect rating scale 21 items brief psychiatric rating scale separated clusters follows positive exaggerated selfesteem suspicion hallucinations unusual thought content excitement hostility uncooperativeness psychomotor agitation cognitive conceptual disorganization specific motor disturbances disorientation negative emotional withdrawal psychomotor retardation blunted affect anxiety depression somatic concern anxietyÌ¡ psychic self depreciation anxietyÌ¡somatic depressive mood symptoms classified lindenmayer et al 22 nineteen items selected uku side effects rating scale assess side effects risperidone items separated subgroups side effects follows psychic concentration difficulties asthenia sleepiness failing memory depression tension neurologic dystonia rigidity hypokinesia hyperkinesia tremor akathisia increased salivation autonomic accommodation disturbances reduced salivation constipation micturition disturbances orthostatic dizziness palpitations analysis plasma concentrations risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone plasma concentrations risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone analyzed clinical pharmacology  therapeutics effect itraconazole risperidone disposition validated hplc method use modification previously published method 23 brief plasma ml added 10 ml glass tubes containing internal standard methylrisperidone l g ml l 1 mol l sodium carbonate ml mixture hexane isoamyl alcohol vol vol added vigorous vortex mixing minutes mixture centrifuged minutes 1500g organic phase transferred clean glass tube evaporated dryness via vacuum drier dry residue reconstituted l mobile phase 50l aliquot solution injected onto hplc system capcell pak mg120 c18 column mm shiseido tokyo japan mobile phase composed 40 mmol l ammonium acetate ph adjusted 1n hydrochloric acid acetonitrile vol vol electrochemical detector shiseido used applied voltage analysis mv linear calibration curve range ng ml established risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone r2 risperidone r2 9 hydroxyrisperidone intraday interday coefficients variation less risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone respectively limits quantification ng ml risperidone ng ml 9 hydroxyrisperidone cyp2d6 genotyping genomic deoxyribonucleic acid isolated blood use qiaamp dna blood mini extraction kit qiagen hilden germany subjects screened allele specific polymerase chain reaction pcr extra long pcr pcrÌ¡restriction fragment length polymorphism methods exclude subjects cyp2d6 alleles 2xn frequently occur asians previously reported 24 25 statistical analyses differences plasma concentrations risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone sum active moiety itraconazole treatment itraconazole discontinuation compared use repeated measures anova bonferroni correction multiple comparisons changes plasma risperidone 9 hydroxyrisperidone ratio brief psychiatric rating scale uku side effect scores itraconazole treatment itraconazole discontinuation also compared friedman repeated measures anova ranks followed tukey test spearman nonparametric test correlation different variables used results given text mean sd p value less regarded statistically significant sigmastat version systat software richmond calif used statistical analyses,,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,DDI Non-randomized clinical trials

The frequency of the c.421A variant allele was 9.5% (95% confidence interval 8.1-11.3%). Subjects with the c.421AA genotype (n = 4) had a 72% larger mean area under the plasma atorvastatin concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) than individuals with the c.421CC genotype had (n = 16; P = 0.049). In participants with the c.421AA genotype, the rosuvastatin AUC(0-infinity) was 100% greater than in those with c.421CA (n = 12) and 144% greater than in those with the c.421CC genotype. Also, those with the c.421AA genotype showed peak plasma rosuvastatin concentrations 108% higher than those in the c.421CA genotype group and 131% higher than those in the c.421CC genotype group (P < or = 0.01). In MDCKII-ABCG2 cells, atorvastatin transport was increased in the apical direction as compared with vector control cells (transport ratio 1.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.1).

18094221,"Effect of rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone.","The authors studied the effect of rifampin, a dual inducer of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risperidone in humans. Ten healthy male subjects were treated daily for 7 days with 600 mg rifampin or with placebo. On day 6, a single dose of 1 mg risperidone was administered. Plasma risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations were measured. Rifampin significantly decreased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve by 51% for risperidone, by 43% for 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and by 45% for the active moieties (risperidone + 9-hydroxyrisperidone). Rifampin also decreased the peak plasma concentration of risperidone by 38%, 9-hydroxyrisperidone by 46%, and the active moieties by 41%. The apparent oral clearance of risperidone approximately doubled after rifampin treatment. Thus, rifampin reduced the exposure to risperidone, probably because of a decrease in its bioavailability through the induction of CYP3A and probably P-glycoprotein.",DDI Randomized clinical trials,

19552746,"Assessment of a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between simvastatin and anacetrapib, a potent cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, in healthy subjects.","Anacetrapib is an orally active, potent inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which is in development for the treatment of dyslipidaemia. Because of the likely use of anacetrapib with hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, we aimed to evaluate the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with simvastatin. A randomized, two-period, two-treatment, balanced, open-label, crossover study in 12 healthy subjects was performed. Subjects received simvastatin 40 mg alone or anacetrapib 150 mg co-administered with simvastatin 40 mg, once daily. Both treatments were administered following a low-fat breakfast for 14 days, separated by a wash-out period of at least 14 days. Safety and tolerability, simvastatin and simvastatin acid concentrations, and lipoproteins, were assessed. Both treatments were well tolerated. The pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were similar with and without anacetrapib administration {AUC(0-24 h) geometric mean ratio [90% confidence interval (CI)] for simvastatin acid and simvastatin were 1.36 [1.17, 1.57] and 1.30 [1.14, 1.47], respectively} based on the prespecified comparability bounds of (0.50, 2.00). Treatment with simvastatin alone led to a mean (95% CI) % reduction from baseline in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) of -36% (-27, -46) compared with a reduction of -54% (-44, -63) for anacetrapib co-administered with simvastatin. There appears to be no clinically meaningful effect of anacetrapib on the pharmacokinetic parameters of simvastatin. When co-administered with simvastatin, anacetrapib appeared to exhibit incremental LDL-C-lowering efficacy, due to CETP inhibition.

23381840,"The influence of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor.","A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted to assess the effect of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban - an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor. Subjects (n_=_34) were enrolled into four groups: young males or females (aged 18-45 years) and elderly males or females (aged >75 years), and received a single dose of 10_mg rivaroxaban. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were determined. Gender had no significant influence on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of rivaroxaban was 41% higher in elderly compared with young subjects; corresponding AUC values for the inhibition of Factor Xa activity and prolongation of prothrombin time were also higher. These changes were the result of reduced rivaroxaban clearance in elderly subjects, mainly owing to decreased renal function. The influence of age was not considered clinically relevant. The maximum plasma concentration was not increased in elderly subjects, and pharmacodynamic parameters returned close to baseline within 24 hours. The results indicate that age alone and gender did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in healthy subjects after a 10_mg

14748817,Effect of rifampicin on pravastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.,"Previous work has shown that rifampicin, a potent inducer of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporters, decreased the plasma concentrations of simvastatin acid by more than 90%. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. In a randomised, cross-over two-phase study with a washout of 4 weeks, 10 healthy volunteers received a 5-day pretreatment with rifampicin (600 mg daily) or placebo. On day 6, a single 40 mg dose of pravastatin was administered orally. Plasma concentrations of pravastatin were measured up to 12 h by a sensitive LC-MS-MS method. During the rifampicin phase, the mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of pravastatin [AUC(0-infinity )] was 69% (range 24-220%) of the corresponding value during the placebo phase (P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval for the difference -51.9 - -0.4 ng ml-1.h). In five of the 10 subjects the AUC(0-infinity ) of pravastatin during the rifampicin phase was 50% or less of that during the placebo phase. Rifampicin had no significant effect on the peak concentration, elimination half-life or renal clearance of pravastatin. Rifampicin caused a statistically significant decrease in the plasma concentration of pravastatin given as a single oral dose to healthy subjects. However, the effect of rifampicin varied greatly between subjects. The mean rifampicin-induced decrease in pravastatin concentration was considerably smaller than that observed previously for simvastatin.",DDI Randomized clinical trials, methods subjects ten healthy nonsmoking volunteers age range years weight range kg participated study table giving written informed consent subjects ascertained healthy medical history physical examination routine blood chemistry tests entered study table characteristics subjects subject sex age weight kg height cm mean male female female female male male male male male female br j clin pharmacol none subjects used oral contraceptives continuous medications sample size chosen possible clinically signi_cant pharmacokinetic drug interaction veri_ed statistically without use unnecessarily large group healthy subjects statistical power estimated suf_cient detect change auc pravastatin power alpha level study design study protocol approved ethics committee studies healthy subjects hospital district helsinki uusimaa finnish national agency medicines randomized placebo controlled cross study design phases used wash period phases weeks subjects given either mg rifampicin rifarm pharmacal helsinki finland matched placebo orally daily p days day pravastatin single pravachol mg tablet bristolmyers squibb new york ny administered orally ml water h last dose rifampicin subjects fasted overnight standard meal served h administration pravastatin alcohol strenuous exercise allowed two days subjects ingest grapefruit juice drugs two weeks test days study design otherwise identical previous rifampicin simvastatin study blood urine sampling blood samples ml drawn cannulated forearm vein prior administration pravastatin h later collected tubes containing ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid edta plasma separated within min stored c analysis urine collected cumulatively h administration pravastatin determination pravastatin concentrations pravastatin plasma urine measured liquid chromatography ionspray tandem mass spectrometry use pe sciex api lc ms ms system sciex division mds inc toronto canada described previously ion transition monitored z z limit quanti_cation ng ml day day coef_cients variation cv ng ml ng ml ng ml n replicates effect rifampicin pravastatin pharmacokinetics pharmacokinetic analysis cmax tmax taken directly original data terminal log linear phase plasma concentration time curve identi_ed visually curve elimination rate constant ke determined linear regression analysis using last points plot natural logarithm plasma concentration time curve t1 calculated equation t1 ln2 ke auc values calculated linear trapezoidal rule rising phase loglinear trapezoidal rule descending phase extrapolation in_nity appropriate dividing last measured concentration ke renal clearance clrenal h pravastatin calculated clrenal h ae auc ae amount pravastatin excreted urine within h statistical analysis results expressed mean values text tables clarity mean values e mean _gures con_dence intervals calculated mean differences placebo rifampicin phases auc cmax t1 statistical comparisons pharmacokinetic variables except tmax carried student test paired values two tailed wilcoxon signed rank test used analysis tmax logarithmic transformation cmax auc values done statistical analysis mann whitney u test used compare effect rifampicin auc pravastatin simvastatin acid analysis performed systat windows v6 spss inc chicago ill level statistical signi_cance p,,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
16198652,Rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics in white and Asian subjects residing in the same environment.,"Systemic exposure to rosuvastatin had been observed to be approximately 2-fold higher in Japanese subjects living in Japan compared with white subjects in Western Europe or the United States. The organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 contributes to the hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin. Polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 gene can lead to reduced transport function in vitro (T 521>C). This study was conducted to determine whether the pharmacokinetic differences between Japanese and white subjects extended to other Asian ethnic groups and to determine whether polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 gene contribute to any pharmacokinetic differences observed. Rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics was studied in an open-label, parallel-group, single-oral dose (40 mg) study in 36 white, 36 Chinese, 35 Malay, and 35 Asian-Indian subjects living in Singapore, Singapore. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin and metabolites were determined by HPLC-mass spectrophotometry. Two SLCO1B1 polymorphisms (A 388>G and T 521>C) were genotyped. Ratios for rosuvastatin area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration were 2.31, 1.91, and 1.63 and ratios for maximum plasma concentration were 2.36, 2.00, and 1.68 in Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indian subjects, respectively, compared with white subjects. Similar increases in exposure to N-desmethyl rosuvastatin and rosuvastatin-lactone were observed. SLCO1B1 genotypes did not account for the observed pharmacokinetic differences between Asians and white subjects. Plasma exposure to rosuvastatin and its metabolites was significantly higher in Chinese, Malay, and Asian-Indian subjects compared with white subjects living in the same environment.",Genotyped

16101667,Not all statins interfere with clopidogrel during antiplatelet therapy.,"Clopidogrel and statins are frequently coadministered in patients with ischemic heart diseases. Recent reports suggested that clopidogrel's effectiveness in inhibiting adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelets aggregation is attenuated by co-administration of certain statins. The objective of the present study was to define which statin might interfere with the antiaggregation property of clopidogrel. We designed a pharmacokinetic study and tested ex vivo platelet function on 21 healthy volunteers who received clopidogrel and all currently commercially available statins: rosuvastatin [10 mg o.d.], simvastatin [20 mg o.d.], fluvastatin [80 mg o.d.], pravastatin [40 mg o.d.], and atorvastatin [20 mg o.d.]. Each statin was administered for 7 days followed by 1 week of wash-out period with clopidogrel treatment alone. Detection of the statins in the plasma was performed on all blood samples, using HPLC analytical method. All individuals, except one, were responders to clopidogrel with inhibition of ex vivo ADP induced platelet aggregation. All statins, except pravastatin, were detectable in the plasma at the end of each treatment period in all patients, and no statin was detectable after any of the wash-out periods. Clopidogrel was significantly less efficient to prevent platelet aggregation when coadministrated with simvastatin or fluvastatin. No difference was observed in clopidogrel efficacy when coadministered with rosuvastatin, pravastatin or atorvastatin. This is the first study investigating clopidogrel-statin interactions on ex vivo platelet function with all commercially available statins and which were administered to the same individuals. It demonstrates in healthy volunteers that at the doses used in this study, simvastatin and fluvastatin, but not atorvastatin, pravastatin or rosuvastatin interfere with the anti-aggregation effect of clopidogrel.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials, methods subjects participants healthy volunteers mean age years received oral dose clopidogrel mg entire study period weeks participants enrolled history drug alcohol abuse liver disease history bleeding diathesis normal prothrombin time platelet count serum creatinine _rst week clopidogrel treatment participants received successively order statins rosuvastatin mg simvastatin mg _uvastatin mg pravastatin mg atorvastatin mg statin administered days followed week washout period clopidogrel treatment alone statin doses chosen based recent clinical trials common doses statin used clinical practice follow good clinical practice clopidogrel administered morning statins bedtime study complies declaration helsinki approved local institutional ethical committee written informed consent obtained participant study _nancially sponsored directly indirectly pharmaceutical company platelet aggregometry blood samples withdrawn beginning baseline without treatment end week study period always time morning h using standard procedures _rst ml discarded samples centrifuged g min c obtain platelet rich plasma prp remaining blood centrifuged g min obtain platelet poor plasma ppp platelet count prp adjusted g l statins clopidogrel platelet interactions autologous ppp platelet aggregation tests performed apact aggregometer labor fibrintimer ahrensburg germany adjusted prp challenged åµ adp concentrations mol l endotell allschwil switzerland previously reported determination statin plasma detection statin plasma performed blood samples using hplc high performance liquid chromatography analytical method previously described brie_y qualitative determination statin plasma performed using agilent lc ms liquid chromatography mass spectrometry system hewlettåµ packart zorbax eclipse xdb c8 column used simultaneous separation statins single run mobile phase acetonitrile ammonium acetate ph separation carried gradient conditions min acetonitrile min acetonitrile min acetonitrile _ow rate ml min ms positive ionization mode electrospray nebulizing gas _ow rate set l min capillary voltage v responses _ve statins measured single ion monitoring sim mode fragmentor voltage v ions statins h simvastatin rosuvastatin atorvastatin _uvastatin pravastatin limit quanti _cation ng ml except pravastatin ng ml suitable detection statin plasma samples samples cleaning solid phase extrac tion performed using oasis hlb columns waters milford usa use columns _rst conditioned ml methanol meoh ml acetic acid one millilitres plasma loaded onto column cartridges washed ml meoh acetic acid cartridges dried vacuum compounds interest eluted acetic acid meoh evaporation stream nitrogen åµ c residues reconstituted l acetonitrileåµ acetic acid l injected onto hplc system statistical analysis statistical analysis wilcoxon matched pairs rank test used compare maximal platelet aggregation statin treatment,,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
12445025,"Pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetics of a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, rosuvastatin, after morning or evening administration in healthy volunteers.","To compare the lipid-regulating effects and steady-state pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin, a new synthetic hydroxy methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, following repeated morning and evening administration in volunteers with fasting serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations < 4.14 mmol l-1. In this open-label two-way crossover trial 24 healthy adult volunteers were randomized to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg orally each morning (07.00 h) or evening (18.00 h) for 14 days. After a 4 week washout period, volunteers received the alternative regimen for 14 days. Rosuvastatin was administered in the absence of food. Reductions from baseline in serum concentrations of LDL-C (-41.3%[morning]vs-44.2%[evening]), total cholesterol (-30.9%vs-31.8%), triglycerides (-17.1%vs-22.7%), and apolipoprotein B (-32.4%vs-35.3%) were similar following morning and evening administration. AUC(0,24 h) for plasma mevalonic acid (MVA), an in vivo marker of HMG-CoA reductase activity, decreased by -29.9% (morning) vs-32.6% (evening). Urinary excretion of MVA declined by -33.6% (morning) vs-29.2% (evening). The steady-state pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin were very similar following the morning and evening dosing regimens. The Cmax values were 4.58 vs 4.54 ng ml-1, and AUC(0,24 h) values were 40.1 vs 42.7 ng ml-1 h, following morning and evening administration, respectively. There were no serious adverse events during the trial, and rosuvastatin was well tolerated after morning and evening administration. The pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin are not dependent on time of dosing.

16011979,The inhibitory potency of clopidogrel on ADP-induced platelet activation is not attenuated when it is co-administered with atorvastatin (20 mg/day) for 5 weeks in patients with acute coronary syndromes.,"The antiplatelet potency of clopidogrel may be attenuated by short-term co-administration of lipophilic statins metabolized through the cytochrome P-450, isoform 3A4. We investigated whether the co-administration of atorvastatin (20?mg/day) for 5 weeks, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) could affect the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel. Fifty-one patients with the first episode of an ACS were included in the study. All patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and received a loading dose of 375 mg of clopidogrel, followed by 75 mg/day for at least 3 months. Twenty-six of them presented with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels >100?mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) (measured within 24 h from the onset of symptoms) and received daily 20 mg/day of atorvastatin. The ADP- or TRAP-induced platelet aggregation, as well as P-selectin and CD40L surface expression, were studied at baseline (within 30 min after admission) and 5 weeks afterwards. Atorvastatin did not influence either the clopidogrel-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation initiated by 5 or 10 microM ADP or the clopidogrel-induced reduction of the membrane expression of P-selectin and CD40L induced by ADP.

21822144,"Effect of multiple doses of omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of a single dose of rivaroxaban.","Many patients with acute coronary syndrome receive chronic dual antiplatelet therapy (acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel) for secondary event prophylaxis, and new oral anticoagulants are being investigated as adjunctive therapy in this indication. Gastrointestinal side effects such as bleeding are commonly associated with antiplatelet use; accordingly, many patients receive proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to mitigate this. PPIs can reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel through cytochrome P450 2C19 inhibition, and pantoprazole reduces the bioavailability of dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor that acts via cytochrome P450 2C19-independent mechanisms. These observations support the investigation of potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between PPIs and anticoagulants. We evaluated the influence of administering once-daily omeprazole 40 mg for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single 20-mg dose of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, in a randomized, open-label, 2-way, crossover, drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects. No clinically meaningful interactions were observed; geometric mean ratios were 101%, 101%, and 93.5% for rivaroxaban area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast), or until infinity (AUC¡), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), respectively. Prothrombin time increased similarly in both treatment groups, with maximal values observed approximately 4 hours post rivaroxaban administration. A single 20-mg rivaroxaban dose appears well tolerated when administered alone or after 5 days of once-daily omeprazole 40 mg administration.",DDI Randomized clinical trials/Abstract, materials

18307374,"Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban--an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor--in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.","There is a clinical need for novel oral anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Rivaroxaban is an oral direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in clinical development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. This analysis was performed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in patients participating in two phase II, double-blind, randomized, active-comparator-controlled studies of twice-daily rivaroxaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total hip- or knee-replacement surgery. Sparse blood samples were taken from all patients participating in the studies (n = 1009). In addition, a subset of patients in the hip study (n = 36) underwent full profiling. Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations, FXa activity and the prothrombin time were determined. Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling was used to model the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban. An oral one-compartment model described the population pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban well. On the first postoperative day only, categorization of patients as slow or fast absorbers as a tool to address variability in absorption improved the fit of the model. Clearance of rivaroxaban was lower and more variable on the first postoperative day, and so time was factored into the model. Overall, the only major difference between the models for the hip study and the knee study was that clearance was 26% lower in the knee study, resulting in approximately 30% higher exposure. Residual variability in the models was moderate (37% and 34% in the hip and knee studies, respectively). Plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban increased dose dependently. Pharmacokinetic parameters that were estimated using the models agreed closely with results from full-profile patients in the hip study, demonstrating that rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics are predictable. The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were affected by expected covariates: age affected clearance in the hip study only, haematocrit (on the first postoperative day only) and gender affected clearance in the knee study only, and renal function affected clearance in both studies. Bodyweight affected the volume of distribution in both studies. However, the effects of covariates on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban were generally small, and predictions of 'extreme' case scenarios suggested that fixed dosing of rivaroxaban was likely to be possible. FXa activity and the prothrombin time were both affected by surgery, probably because of perioperative bleeding and intravenous administration of fluids; therefore, time was included in the pharmacodynamic models. In both studies, FXa activity correlated with rivaroxaban plasma concentrations following a maximum effect model, whereas prothrombin time prolongation correlated following a linear model with intercept. The slope of the prothrombin time prolongation correlation was 3.2 seconds/(100 microg/L) in the hip study and 4.2 seconds/(100 microg/L) in the knee study. Both pharmacodynamic models in both studies demonstrated low residual variability of approximately 10%. This population analysis in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery demonstrated that rivaroxaban has predictable, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics that were well described by an oral one-compartment model and affected by expected covariates. Rivaroxaban exposure could be assessed using the prothrombin time, if necessary, but not the international normalized ratio. The findings suggested that fixed dosing of rivaroxaban may be possible in patients undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.",Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial, methods studies rivaroxaban phase

21895039,Rivaroxaban: population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients treated for acute deep-vein thrombosis and exposure simulations in patients with atrial fibrillation treated for stroke prevention.,"Rivaroxaban is an oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor, which is at an advanced stage of clinical development for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Two phase II studies, ODIXa-DVT and EINSTEIN DVT, assessed the efficacy and safety of oral rivaroxaban (once daily or twice daily) for treatment of acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of rivaroxaban in patients in these two phase II studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban and the relationship between important patient covariates and model parameters. Exposure simulations in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were also performed in order to predict the exposure of rivaroxaban, using modified demographic data reflecting the characteristics of a typical AF population. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using plasma samples from these patients. Various simulations were conducted to explore the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in patients with DVT and to predict exposure in those with AF. Correlations between plasma rivaroxaban concentrations and the prothrombin time, Factor Xa activity, HepTest¬ and activated partial thromboplastin time were also described. The pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in patients with DVT were found to be consistent and predictable across all doses studied. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased dose dependently. The same total daily doses given once daily achieved higher maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) values (_20%) and lower trough (minimum) plasma concentration (C(trough)) values (_60%) than when given twice daily; however, the 5th-95th percentile ranges for these parameters overlapped. Rivaroxaban clearance was moderately influenced by age and renal function, and the volume of distribution was influenced by age, body weight and sex; the effects were within the observed interindividual variability. Simulations in virtual patient populations with AF showed that a rivaroxaban dose of 15_mg once daily in patients with creatinine clearance of 30-49_mL/min would achieve AUC and C(max) values similar to those observed with 20_mg once daily in patients with normal renal function. The prothrombin time correlated almost linearly with plasma rivaroxaban concentrations (_500__g/L). Population analyses of phase II clinical data indicated that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of all rivaroxaban doses were predictable and were affected by expected demographic factors in

17015053,SLCO1B1 polymorphism and sex affect the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin but not fluvastatin.,"Pravastatin is a hydrophilic substrate and fluvastatin a lipophilic substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 encoded by SLCO1B1. Our aim was to compare the effects of SLCO1B1 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin and fluvastatin. We recruited 4 healthy volunteers (3 men and 1 woman) with the homozygous SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype, 12 (7 men and 5 women) with the heterozygous c.521TC genotype, and 16 (8 men and 8 women) with the homozygous c.521TT genotype (control subjects). In a crossover study each subject ingested a single 40-mg dose of fluvastatin and pravastatin with a washout period of at least 1 week. Plasma fluvastatin and pravastatin concentrations were measured for 12 hours. In men with the c.521CC genotype, the mean peak concentration in plasma and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity of pravastatin were 274% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92%-456%; P = .001) and 232% (95% CI, 74%-391%; P = .002) greater than those in men with the c.521TT genotype and 120% (95% CI, 11%-230%; P = .026) and 102% (95% CI, 3%-200%; P = .040) greater than those in men with the c.521TC genotype. In addition, women with the c.521TT genotype had a 147% (95% CI, 12%-281%; P = .028) greater peak concentration in plasma and a 142% (95% CI, 7%-242%; P = .034) greater area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity than men with the c.521TT genotype. The pharmacokinetic variables of pravastatin were approximately similar among women with different SLCO1B1 genotypes. No significant differences were seen in the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin between subjects with different SLCO1B1 genotypes or between the sexes. SLCO1B1 polymorphism has a large effect on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin but not fluvastatin. This suggests that the lipophilic fluvastatin can penetrate the hepatocyte plasma membrane via passive diffusion or that uptake transporters other than organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 mainly mediate its hepatic uptake. Moreover, the results suggest that sex may affect the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin and possibly the functional consequences of SLCO1B1 polymorphism.",Genotyped Pharmacokinetic Trials/Abstract,

17121171,Serum monitoring of antipsychotic drug levels during concomitant administration of sertraline and antipsychotic medication.,"To assess whether pharmacokinetic drug interactions occur when sertraline is added to antipsychotic medications. Forty-eight patients with remitted DSM-IV schizophrenia and comorbid major depression were randomized to placebo for 6 weeks or sertraline 50 mg for 4 weeks followed by sertraline 50 mg to 100 mg for 2 weeks for nonresponders. Treatment with the patients' usual antipsychotic continued. Weekly clinical outcome assessments occurred for 6 weeks, and serum samples for drug monitoring were collected at Weeks 1, 5, and 6. Serum concentrations of sertraline and antipsychotics were measured with standard assays. In both placebo- and sertraline-treated groups, most patients displayed minor fluctuations in antipsychotic serum levels over 6 weeks. There was no clinical evidence of drug interactions in the sertraline-treated group. Clinically significant adverse effects did not occur despite variable antipsychotic serum levels with or without sertraline. Concern about pharmacokinetic interactions should not deter the use of sertraline for depression in individuals with schizophrenia.",DDI Randomized clinical trials/Abstract, methods study approved research ethics committee details study design published elsewhere participants aged years dsm iv major depression comorbid schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder partial full remission double blind trial participants n  schizophrenia n  schizoaffective disorder randomized following written informed consent placebo weeks sertraline mg weeks followed sertraline mg weeks showed evidence response participants stable antipsychotic regimen clinical outcomes assessed weekly weeks cdss positive negative syndrome scale extrapyramidal symptom rating scale hdrs serum samples collected weeks drug monitoring time date last dose taken blood sampling recorded serum drug concentrations measured standard assays sertraline antipsychotics change antipsychotic serum levels defined meaningful basis therapeutic drug monitoring studies risperidone olanzapine fisherÌ_s exact tests performed stata version stata corporation college station tx compare fluctuations antipsychotic levels groups,,Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
18754003,Effects of vitamin D supplementation in atorvastatin-treated patients: a new drug interaction with an unexpected consequence.,"The objective of this study was to determine vitamin D supplementation effects on concentrations of atorvastatin and cholesterol in patients. Sixteen patients (8 men, 8 women; 10 Caucasians, 4 African Americans, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian), aged 63 +/- 11 years (mean +/- SD, weight 92 +/- 31 kg) on atorvastatin (45 +/- 33 mg/day) were studied with and without supplemental vitamin D (800 IU/day for 6 weeks). Levels of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxy(OH) and 25 OH-metabolites), atorvastatin (parent, OH-acid metabolites, lactone, and lactone metabolites), and cholesterol (total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol) were determined at 0.5, 3, and 10 h after dosing. Vitamin D supplementation increased vitamin D-25-OH metabolites (P < 0.0001) without increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. Atorvastatin and active metabolite concentrations (P < 0.001) as well as LDL-cholesterol and total-cholesterol levels (97 +/- 28 mg/dl vs. 83 +/- 30 and 169 +/- 35 mg/dl vs. 157 +/- 37, P < 0.005) were lower during vitamin D supplementation. The conclusion of the study is that vitamin D supplementation lowers atorvastatin and active metabolite concentrations yet has synergistic effects on cholesterol concentrations.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials/Abstract, aging often considered result decreases drug clearance studies healthy humans report agerelated decreases clearance cytochrome p450 cyp 3a 1_8 contrast studies nifedipine verapamil amlodipine patient groups found age related decreases apparent oral drug clearance oxidatively metabolized medications 9_ also found erythromycin breath test clearance rates elderly frail patients within range often considered reflect Ì±inducedÌ¨ state drug metabolism 12 use clinically recognized cyp inducers13 infrequent older populations use multivitamin preparations calcium plus vitamin supplements strikingly higher age increased nursing home residents compared community dwelling participants women compared men formation 1 25 oh vitamin d_vitamin receptor complex shown activate cyp3a intestine colon hepatic cell lines 14_16 atorvastatin frequently prescribed 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa hmg coa reductase inhibitor low oral bioavailability chiefly due extensive first pass metabolism cyp3a intestine liver 17 atorvastatin administered atorvastatin acid extensively metabolized via lactonization cyp3a4 mediated oxidations form two major active metabolites 2 hydroxy atorvastatin acid 4 hydroxy atorvastatin acid hydroxylated metabolites excreted bile unchanged form glucuronide conjugates 18 vitro data shown active 1 25 hydroxy vitamin contributes regulation cyp3a activity forming complex vitamin receptor leads increased transcription cyp3a protein greater metabolism cyp3a substrate midazolam 14 15 thus hypothesized supplemental vitamin might increase cyp3a substrate clearance rates patients study designed test hypothesis supplemental vitamin intake lowers plasma concentrations cyp3a substrate atorvastatin stable patients clinical consequence higher cholesterol concentrations,,Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial
19593168,ABCB1 and cytochrome P450 polymorphisms: clinical pharmacogenetics of clozapine.,"To examine the genetic factors influencing clozapine kinetics in vivo, 75 patients treated with clozapine were genotyped for CYPs and ABCB1 polymorphisms and phenotyped for CYP1A2 and CYP3A activity. CYP1A2 activity and dose-corrected trough steady-state plasma concentrations of clozapine correlated significantly (r = -0.61; P = 1 x 10), with no influence of the CYP1A2*1F genotype (P = 0.38). CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (*2/*2 genotype) had 2.3-fold higher (P = 0.036) clozapine concentrations than the extensive metabolizers (non-*2/*2). In patients comedicated with fluvoxamine, a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, clozapine and norclozapine concentrations correlate with CYP3A activity (r = 0.44, P = 0.075; r = 0.63, P = 0.007, respectively). Carriers of the ABCB1 3435TT genotype had a 1.6-fold higher clozapine plasma concentrations than noncarriers (P = 0.046). In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time a significant in vivo role of CYP2C19 and the P-gp transporter in the pharmacokinetics of clozapine. CYP1A2 is the main CYP isoform involved in clozapine metabolism, with CYP2C19 contributing moderately, and CYP3A4 contributing only in patients with reduced CYP1A2 activity. In addition, ABCB1, but not CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, nor CYP3A7 polymorphisms, influence clozapine pharmacokinetics.",Genotyped Pharmacokinetic Trials/Abstract, materials methods patients

12172343,Inhibition of risperidone metabolism by fluoxetine in patients with schizophrenia: a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interaction.,"The effect of fluoxetine on the steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH-risperidone) was evaluated in 10 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients stabilized on risperidone (4-6 mg/day) received additional fluoxetine (20 mg/day) to treat concomitant depression. One patient dropped out after 1 week due to the occurrence of akathisia associated with markedly increased plasma risperidone concentrations. In the other subjects, mean plasma concentrations of risperidone increased during fluoxetine administration from 12 +/- 9 ng/mL at baseline to 56 +/- 31 at week 4 (p < 0.001), while the levels of 9-OH-risperidone were not significantly affected. After 4 weeks of combined treatment, the levels of the active moiety (sum of the concentrations of risperidone and 9-OH-risperidone) increased by 75% (range, 9-204%, p < 0.01) compared with baseline. The mean plasma risperidone/9-OH-risperidone ratio also increased significantly. During the second week of adjunctive therapy, two patients developed Parkinsonian symptoms, which were controlled with anticholinergic medication. These findings indicate that fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 and a less potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, reduces the clearance of risperidone by inhibiting its 9-hydroxylation or alternative metabolic pathways. This interaction may lead to toxic plasma risperidone concentrations. In addition to careful clinical observation, monitoring plasma risperidone levels may be of value in patients given adjunctive therapy with fluoxetine.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials/Abstract, patients methods ten outpatients seven men three women age 27_55 years diagnosis schizophrenia n schizoaffective disorder depressive type n according criteria dsm iv followed centers mental health participated study protocol approved local ethics committee written informed consent obtained patients relatives patients stabilized risperidone constant dosage 4_6 mg day given two divided daily administrations least weeks received adjunctive fluoxetine treatment mg day morning management concomitant depression dosage risperidone maintained constant throughout duration study use drugs known act inhibitors inducers risperidone metabolism allowed 15 study designed open pharmacokinetic investigation observation period limited first weeks combination therapy blood samples pharmacokinetic evaluations drawn heparinized tubes a m hours last dose risperidone immediately morning fluoxetine risperidone doses week starting fluoxetine baseline weeks combination therapy plasma separated immediately stored c assayed risperidone 9 oh risperidone concentrations measured hplc according validated method developed laboratory limit quantitation nmol l analytes 16 measure compliance plasma concentrations sand r enantiomers fluoxetine metabolite norfluoxetine estimated week enantioselective hplc method 17 patients also genotyped cyp2d6 allelespecific polymerase chain reaction 18 tolerability assessed interview medical examination baseline weeks extrapyramidal side effects specifically investigated times using simpson angus scale sas 19 psychopathological state assessed using positive negative syndrome scale panss 20 psychotic symptoms hamilton rating scale depression ham d 21 depressive symptomatology differences plasma concentrations risperidone oh risperidone sum active moiety weeks compared baseline evaluated statistically using student t test bonferroni correction multiple comparisons changes plasma risperidone 9 oh risperidone ratio sas panss ham d scores fluoxetine treatment compared wilcoxon signed rank test results given text mean sd p value regarded statistically significant,,Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial,DDI Non-randomized clinical trials/Abstract
19865002,Effect of valproate on olanzapine plasma concentrations in patients with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder.,"The effect of valproate on the steady-state plasma concentrations of olanzapine was investigated in 18 patients with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder. Additional valproate, at a dose ranging from 600 to 2000 mg/d, was administered for 4 weeks to patients stabilized on olanzapine (5-20 mg/d). During valproate coadministration, mean plasma olanzapine concentrations decreased significantly from 32.9 +/- 9.7 ng/mL at baseline to 27.4 +/- 9.8 ng/mL at week 2 (P = 0.02), and to 26.9 +/- 9.2 ng/mL at week 4 (P = 0.001). Smoking also decreased plasma olanzapine concentrations. Valproate coadministration with olanzapine was well tolerated and no patient showed a worsening of his or her psychopathological condition. These findings indicate that valproate, at doses of up to 2000 mg/d, is associated with a minimal, presumably not clinically significant, decrease in plasma olanzapine concentrations, possibly as a result of induction of olanzapine metabolism. New studies are needed to confirm that valproate could have mild inductive effects.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials/Abstract, patients methods patients twenty one outpatients men women aged 23_ years participated study diagnosis bipolar n  schizoaffective n  disorder according diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders dsm iv stabilized olanzapine required treatment mood stabilizer protocol approved local ethics committee written informed consent obtained patients relatives study design receiving adjunctive valproate mood stabilizer patients received olanzapine constant dose 5_20 mg d month dose kept constant throughout study addition plasma concentration monitoring compliance olanzapine treatment also checked pill count initial valproate doses decided treating physician doses subsequently individualized according clinical response usually within 7_10 days maintained stable use drugs known act inhibitors inducers olanzapine metabolism allowed 3 concomitant treatment medications present remained unchanged blood samples pharmacokinetic evaluations drawn heparinized tubes 12_13 hours olanzapine dose week starting valproate treatment baseline weeks valproate coadministration plasma separated immediately stored c assayed tolerability evaluated interview medical examination baseline weeks combined therapy open uncontrolled design using small heterogeneous sample clinical efficacy combination assessed drug assays steady state plasma olanzapine concentrations measured high performance liquid chromatography according method dÌ_arrigo et al14 assay quantification limit ng ml ensure treatment compliance plasma valproate concentrations determined enzymemultiplied immunoassay limit quantification mg ml statistics olanzapine plasma concentrations baseline valproate comedication compared pairedsamples tests bonferroni correction multiple comparisons means sd variables reported p value regarded statistically significant analysis repeated measures provided patients effect valproate concentrations possible changes olanzapine concentrations investigated fitting random intercept linear model 15 model dependent variable difference patientÌ_s olanzapine concentration measured particular time weeks baseline olanzapine concentration independent variables patientÌ_s age current smoking status valproate concentrations undergoing weeks valproate treatment compared weeks investigate possible difference valproate effects fourth second week valproate treatment week_ valproate concentration interaction term also included model analyses residuals intercept predictors suggested model fit well statistical analyses performed stata software 16,,Non-RCT non-parallel DDI Clinical Trial,DDI Non-randomized clinical trials/Abstract
7586933,In vivo inhibition profile of cytochrome P450TB (CYP2C9) by (+/-)-fluvastatin.,"(+/-)-Fluvastatin is a synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor that selectively and competitively inhibits P450TB (CYP2C9) in vitro. The potential for kinetic interactions in vivo between fluvastatin and P450TB substrates was therefore investigated in healthy volunteers. Diclofenac (25 mg orally) oxidation was used as a marker of P450TB activity on days 0, 1, and 8 of fluvastatin treatment (40 mg/day). Diclofenac peak concentration (Cmax) increased over time (0.28 [SD, 0.12], 0.38 [0.20], and 0.45 [0.4] mg/L on days 0, 1, and 8, respectively). Oral clearance was reduced on days 1 and 8 (14% and 15%, respectively). A time-dependent decrease in urinary metabolic ratio (MR, 4'-hydroxydiclofenac/diclofenac) was noted (1.07 [0.34], 0.90 [0.23] and 0.70 [0.18] on days 0, 1, and 8, respectively [p < 0.0001]) for the first 4 hours. The interaction was clear in only some individuals; MR reduction was related to baseline MR and it was more pronounced in subjects with a higher baseline MR (p < 0.01). Fluvastatin Cmax (0.18 [0.11] and 0.32 [0.1] mg/L on days 1 and 8, respectively) and area under the curve (0.28 [0.12] and 0.43 [0.15] hr.mg/L on days 1 and 8, respectively; p < 0.001) increased over time. Diclofenac MR reduction was correlated with fluvastatin concentrations. Interactions between fluvastatin and P450TB substrates (phenytoin, oral anticoagulants, oral hypoglycemic agents, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs) may occur, at least in some patients.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials, methods drugs capsules fluvastatin mg capsule batch x067 desisopropylpropionic acid derivative provided sandoz pharma basel switzerland diclofenac administered liquid formulation voltaren drops ciba geigy basel switzerland subjects fourteen healthy volunteers seven women seven men selected medical examination ulcers asthma allergy drugs taken drug weeks study women taking oral contraceptives average sd age  years body weight  kg height cm investigational protocol approved institutional ethical committee department medicine university geneva subjects gave written informed consent protocol fasting volunteers received mg oral doses diclofenac days fluvastatin one mg capsule administered day day standardized lunch given hours diclofenac administration blood samples collected days fluvastatin administration taking diclofenac l 2 hours diclofenac medication blood samples centrifuged minutes rpm plasma stored c analyzed urine also collected hours hours stored c analyzed determine urinary metabolic ratio mr  4 hydroxydiclofenacfdiclofenac analytic methods plasma diclofenac mefenamic acid pl ymol l solution internal standard added aliquots plasma samples samples acidified mol l hydrochloric acid pl extracted dichloromethane ml samples tumbled minutes centrifuged rpm minutes organic layer ml transferred clean tube evaporated dryness nitrogen stream r2 residue reconstituted mobile phase mixture mol l ph phosphate buffer acetonitrile triethylamine supematants pl injected hp autosampler hewlett packard co roseville calif directly onto lichrocart cl e merck darmstadt germany column x mm pm protected precolumn x mm pm mobile phase delivered ml min hp pump hewlett packard co column effluent monitored nm hp variable wavelength ultraviolet detector hewlett packard co peak heights hp 3396a integrator hewlett packard co used quantification fluvastatin metabolite s interfere assay vn nary diclofenac 4 hydraxydiclofenac ascorbic acid mg l solution mol l sodium hydroxide pl added urinary samples pj mixture vortexed seconds heated hour c thereafter mefenamic acid kmol l solution internal standard added samples clinical pharmacology  therapeutics volume number t anson et al fluvastatin c m x mm auc o 9 hr mg l  o ol o ol acidified mol l hydrochloric acid pl 13 remainder extraction procedure described plasma residues reconstituted mobile phase mixture mol l ph phosphate buffer acetonitrile plasma fluvastatin fluvastatin quantified means hplc method fluorescence detec diclofenac 4 hydroxydiclofenac tion described 14 detected described plasma samples interference fluvastatin metabolite statistical analysis pharmacokinetic parameters diclofenac alone single multiple doses fluvastatin compared use anova friedman test nonparametric pharmacokinetic parameters fluvastatin desisopropylpropionic acid derivative compared use paired test,,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
6734030,Imipramine disposition in users of oral contraceptive steroids.,"Ten women on long-term, low-dose estrogen oral contraceptive steroids (OCS) and eight age-matched drug-free female controls received an intravenous infusion of 12.5 mg imipramine. Eleven (six OCS users and five controls) also took a 50-mg oral dose of imipramine on another occasion. After intravenous injection, volume of distribution was much the same in the OCS and control groups and clearance was of the same order (899 and 975 ml/min). Elimination t1/2 was prolonged in OCS users after intravenous doses (17.8 vs 25.5 hr) but did not change after oral doses (18.4 vs 19.1 hr). Imipramine plasma protein binding was of the same order in both groups. Absolute bioavailability increased in OCS users (from 27.1% vs 44.1%), which resulted in a trend toward decreased apparent oral clearance (from 4649 vs 2322 ml/min). Women who used OCS regularly show little change in imipramine kinetics after intravenous dosing. After oral dosing absolute systemic bioavailability increased, resulting in decreased apparent oral clearance in the absence of any change in oral elimination t1/2. Imipramine (with high first-pass hepatic extraction) is nonrestrictively cleared, with drug elimination predominantly a function of hepatic blood flow. These data are consistent with OCS inhibition of hepatic imipramine oxidation with no alteration in hepatic blood flow resulting from chronic OCS use.",DDI Non-randomized clinical trials, methods subjects healthy women aged yr within ideal body weight kg 6 signs medical psychiatric disease subjects cigarette smokers one group n  consisted women taking low dose estrogen ethinyl estradiol i kg less ocs least mo control subjects taking medications otherwise much like users oral contraceptives table studies done random subjects menstrual cycles consistent methodology used studies 4 delineated effects chronic ocs use metabolism drugs subjects received intravenous dose imipramine eleven six ocs users five control subjects also received imipramine mouth separate trial random sequence least wk separated trials drug administration follows trial imipramine mg iv infused min trial ii overnight fast mg imipramine taken mouth ml water food taken hr imipramine imipramine dose venous blood samples drawn venoject terumo medical corp heparinized tubes dosing end drug injection min hr intravenous injection sampling schedule oral doses except deletion min samples indwelling butterfly cannula kept patent slow infusion normal saline solution ml hr used draw samples first hr imipramine samples drawn separate venipuncture blood specimens centrifuged plasma separated stored analyzed imipramine desipramine concentrations determined glc nitrogen phosphorus detection 5 extent imipramine binding plasma protein subject determined single samples obtained nonfasting state least hr imipramine binding determined equilibrium dialysis duplicate 1 ml plasma samples plasma lmipramine oral contraceptive use table subject characteristics kinetic variables imipramine ocs users controls subjects age yr weight kg cigarette smokers intravenous imipramine elimination t1 2 hr vd clearance ml min auc ng ml oral imipramine elimination t1 2 hr apparent oral clearance ml min auc ng m1 hr absolute bioavailability  protein binding  unbound ocs users controls                1401t   32t     data x  se  tp  p  spiked ng ml tritiated imipramine nci m1 dialysis carried ph hr recovery imipramine dialysis system complete variation replicate samples always equilibrium bound unbound imipramine complete hr imipramine binding concentration independent ng ml intravenous imipramine plasma drug concentrations fitted equations formed linear sum two three exponential terms iterative weighted nonlinear leastsquares regression analysis correction coefficients infusion period fitted functions used calculate elimination total apparent volume distribution vd area method total abernethy et al control metabolic clearance auc time zero determined integration derived exponential function oral doses auc hr calculated trapezoidal method residual area extrapolated infinity calculated final concentration divided slope terminal phase plasma concentrationtime curve added yield total auc slope terminal phase plasma concentrationtime curve used calculate oral elimination t1 2 absolute bioavailability determined dose normalized ratios fasting oral auc intravenous auc,,Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
6282204,"Disposition of ketoconazole, an oral antifungal, in humans.","The pharmacology of ketoconazole was studied in patients with fungal infections. After administration of 50-, 100-, and 200-mg doses of ketoconazole, there was a linear increase in the area under the curve of serum concentrations; this was not apparent when higher doses of ketoconazole were given. An increase in the area under the curve occurred in patients receiving 200 mg daily who were restudied after 1 to 12 months of therapy. However, normalized area under the curve appeared to decrease after higher doses were administered chronically. The half life ranged from 2.0 to 3.3 h. Peak serum concentrations up to 50 micrograms/ml were detected in this study, and potentially therapeutic concentrations were detectable up to 26 h after high doses. Ketoconazole penetrated the saliva and inflamed joint fluid and meninges, although variably, and could be demonstrated in some other tissue compartments. In the presence of renal failure, ketoconazole disposition was not altered, whereas in the presence of hepatic insufficiency, an alteration in disposition was suggested. The interactions of ketoconazole and other drugs were studied.

Thus addition of a tricyclic antidepressant may lead to loss of blood pressure control in a hypertensive patient treated with clonidine.,DDI Non-randomized clinical trials, materials methods five hypertensive patients long term medication clonidine diuretic asked join study r c clinical pharmacology research group royal postgraduate medical school london w12 ohs clinical pharmacology robin h briant b r c p wellcome research fellow colin dollery b f r c p professor clinical pharmacology department medicine hammersmith hospital london w12 ohs john l reid b r c p senior registrar case sex age clonidine dose tg day diuretic duration therapy years f chlorthalidone mg alternate days hydrochlorothiazide hydrochlorothiazide hydrochlorothiazide mg daily mg daily mg daily chlorthalidone mg alternate days investigation explained freely consented details patients given table patient daily dose clonidine diuretic maintained throughout study divided three parts first period baseline observation ensure control adequate consistent blood pressure lying standing measured sphygmomanometer least three occasions least three weeks several recordings made visit visits kept nearly possible time made patient home work periods comprised two weeks patient took either desipramine mg day number matched placebo tablets patients allocated random start either placebo desipramine study carried double blind conditions periods patients seen least twice week one patient case keep agreed protocol blood pressure rose considerably hours beginning active drug associated headache profuse sweating reduction desipramine dose resultedin lessening symptoms blood pressure remained high study terminated average blood pressure patient calculated whole run period second week treatment period except case comparative periods week treatment within patient observations compared unpaired student test group observations paired test,,DDI Non-randomized clinical trials,DDI Non-randomized clinical trials
3146770,Comparison of alprazolam plasma levels in normal Asian and Caucasian male volunteers.,"Single-dose pharmacokinetics of alprazolam was studied in 42 normal male volunteers (14 Caucasians, 14 American-born Asians, and 14 foreign-born Asians), after both oral and parenteral (IV) administration of a small dose (0.5 mg) of the test drug. Asians manifested significantly higher Cmax, larger AUC, slower CL and longer t1/2 under both testing situations. When body surface area was used as a covariate, these cross-ethnic differences remained statistically significant (except Cmax) after oral but not IV drug administration. There were no differences between the two Asian groups in any of these parameters examined in this study. These results confirmed previous observations of ethnic differences in the pharmacokinetic response between Asians and Caucasians and suggested that smaller doses of alprazolam may be required for Asians for similar clinical effects as compared to their Caucasian counterparts.",Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial, subjects methods subjects total healthy male volunteer subjects studied equally divided following three groups caucasians c american born asians aba foreign born asians fba c subjects born raised united states aba subjects also born raised united states following subcultural identification three chinese five filipino six japanese fba subjects born raised outside united states least age included ten chinese three filipino one japanese subjects normal physical examination biochemical screening profile electrolytes liver function tests thyroid function tests complete blood count urinalysis toxicology screening subjects denied entry study history chronic disease substance abuse taken medication days prior study subjects also excluded history seizures allergic reaction benzodiazepines psychotic disorders major depressive illness subjects nonsmokers rarely consumed alcoholic drinks procedures giving written informed consent subjeers admitted clinical research center two separate testing sessions separated least 2 week interval a m 12 h fast alprazolam rag administered either oral tablet water ml slow iv injection median cubital vein iv drug mg ml propylene glycolwater vehicle infused l rain period arm opposite in dwelling catheter inserted h prior drug administration venous blood sampling catheter filled heparinized saline u ml throughout study following test dose subjects fasted additional h subjects allowed water ad lib entire fasting period remained sedentary course study strenuous physical activity prohibited h following drug administration blood ml collected three times prior alprazolam dose time h h h rain h dose aliquots plasma frozen  c assayed assay plasma samples assayed alprazolam concentration high performance liquid chromatography hplc adams et al inter assay coefficient variation ng ml pharmacokinetic statistical analysis plasma alprazolam concentration time data fitted sum two three exponentials using cstrip computer program uses linear regression method residuals curve fitting process sedman wagner area plasma concentration curve auc calculated trapezoidal rule last time point measurable concentration auc extrapolated infinity adding value last concentration drug divided apparent elimination rate constant fl alprazolam total plasma clearance cl calculated dividing dose auc volume distribution va calculated dividing cl ft peak plasma concentration c time required reach peak concentration t j also calculated analysis variance used compare variables among three comparison groups duncan body surface area calculated patient s weight height used comparisons covariate lentner since tame sample characteristics  alprazolam study raw data gaussian distributed log transformed order normalize data prior statistical analyses,,Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial,Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial
3069477,"Parenteral pentazocine: effects on psychomotor skills and respiration, and interactions with amitriptyline.","The combined effects on performance and respiration of pentazocine (PZ) and amitriptyline (AMI) were evaluated in a double-blind cross-over study in 11 healthy students. After pretreatment for 1 week with AMI or placebo, on Day 8 the subjects received placebo or 50 mg p.o. AMI and 30 mg PZ or saline i.m. so that the final treatments were 1) placebo, 2) acute AMI 50 mg, 3) acute PZ, 4) subchronic AMI + acute PZ and 5) subchronic AMI. The subacute treatments were started at two-week intervals. Objective and subjective performance tests and respiratory function (minute volume, ETCO2) were measured. Parenteral PZ impaired sensory processing (digit symbol substitution, choice reactions) and extraocular muscle balance (Maddox wing) but left motor skills (tracking, tapping speed) unaffected. A single oral dose of AMI 50 mg affected both sensory and motor performance. The psychomotor effects of PZ were clearest at 1.5 h, and those of AMI at 3.5 h. Both drugs rendered the subjects drowsy, clumsy, and muzzy on visual analogue scales, but PZ also induced positive feelings, like contentedness and friendliness. PZ depressed respiration in terms of lowered minute volume and elevated ETCO2, and subchronic AMI increased this depression. The chemically assayed plasma concentrations of AMI and PZ were as expected; radioreceptor assay revealed low or negligible mu-opiate activity in plasma after PZ. The results suggest that AMI does not enhance the moderate psychomotor decrement produced by PZ. However, respiratory depression may be increased by their concomitant use.",DDI Randomized clinical trials, materials methods subjects eleven healthy students either sex years old weighing kg

1914376,Influence of menstrual cycle and gender on alprazolam pharmacokinetics.,"The effects of menstrual cycle phases and gender on alprazolam pharmacokinetics were evaluated in normal volunteers. Alprazolam (1 mg) was administered to seven women during the late follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle and to eight men on one occasion. No difference in alprazolam pharmacokinetic parameters was observed during the menstrual cycle phases. Mean alprazolam clearance (+/- SD) was 0.0037 +/- 0.0009 ml/hr during the follicular phase and 0.0036 +/- 0.001 ml/hr during the luteal phase (p greater than 0.05, difference not significant). With use of weight as a covariant, there was no difference in alprazolam pharmacokinetic parameters between women and men. Mean alprazolam clearance (+/- SD) was 0.0036 +/- 0.0009 ml/hr in women compared with 0.0041 +/- 0.0006 ml/hr in men (p greater than 0.05, difference not significant). Although alprazolam metabolism was similar on the 2 days tested, alterations may occur at other times during the menstrual cycle.

849674,Pharmacokinetics of chlorpromazine after single and chronic dosage.,"Plasma concentrations of chlorpromazine and its sulfoxide were measured after single intramuscular, single oral, and multiple oral doses of chlorpromazine. In four out of nine patients, intramuscular doses gave stable chlorpromazine plasma levels which were maintained for 12 hr or longer. Chlorpromazine sulfoxide was found in plasma from all patients after oral doses but not after intramuscular doses, which indicates that sulfoxidation took place presystemically. The biologic availability of single oral doses relative to single intramuscular doses ranged from 10 to 69%, and was on average 32%. After 33 days of oral dosing, the plasma levels of chlorpromazine were on average 37% lower than might have been predicted from the single oral dose curves. This was not due to decreased biologic t 1/2 of chlorpromazine, but apparently to a decrease in the biologic availability by oral administration, possibly by increased presystemic metabolism.",Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial, methods subjects head psychiatrist hos pital departments study conducted selected female ps ychiatric patients study formed aim study pro tocol nine patients agreed take part one later withdrawn age body weight eight subjects given table patients hospital yr treated various neuroleptics patients received metho trimeprazine mg daily patient ftufenazine enantate mg intramuscularly every third week patients flu pentixol daily doses ranging mg patient haloperidol  mg daily sub jects somatically healthy electrocardiogram hemoglobin serum creatinine alkaline phosphatases  bilirubin serum proteins  serum cholesterol controlled study experimental design au medication withdrawn wk prior single intramuscular dose chlorpromazine drugs given study patient received last ftufenazine dose wk study tablets solution injection con tained chlorpromazine hel dos es plasma concentrations however given equivalent amount concentration free base tablets taken shortly al sandwiches milk coffee according hospital routine 31h hr administration single dose morning doses given period repeated dosing hot meal served first blood sampie series taken shortly drug administered hr  single intramuscular dose single mg dahl strandjord e cn c c  c cii u c u lj e l il patient single dos es mg i m  cpz mg orally _ cpz cpzso   clinical pharmacology therapeutics multiple oral dosing 100mg x cpz cpzso day day day   1 li   time dose hr fig results patient see legend fig e cn c c  c cii u c u lj e l il   1iiiiii1 patient single doses mg i m  cpz mg orally  cpz cpzso      day day   multiple oral dosing 100mg x _cpz cl cpzso day i1iiiii111111 4b time dose hr fig results patient see legend fig dose injected intragluteally patients allowed sit walk usual injection blood sampies collected hr injection single oral dose single mg oral dose given wk single intramuscular dose blood sampies collected hr repeated oral dosing oral maintenance dosing mg twice daily started days single oral dose_ blood sampie collected shortly morning dose hr evening dose days 14_ maintenance dosing stopped day morning dose given blood sampies collected hr last dose blood sampling assay procedure ml sampie blood collected cubital vein heparinized polyethylene tubes immediately centrifuged plasma vo ume number chlorpromazine kinetics single chronic dosage c cij u c u e l single doses mg im a a cpz mg orally  cpz patient cpzsa  multiple oral dosing iddmg x _cpz cpzsa  day day day l liu l u i u l j ______ _____ li _____ time dose hr fig results patient see legend fig e ol c c  c c1j u c u e cl single doses mg i m cpz iod mg orally  cpz patient  cpzsa    day day l lo multiple oral dosing iod mg x cpz  cpzsa time dose hr fig results patient see legend fig frozen two aliquots indwelling cannula used sampies taken one day wassermann ne edle used sampies  plasma sampies stored c analyzed gaschromatographie method6 based flame ionisation deteetion two aliquots plasma sampie analyzed different days two injeetions gas ehromatograph plasma aliquot pharmacokinetic calculations pharmaeokinetie eonstants ealculated eaeh subjeet previously derived equations 5 assuming first order kinetics elimination ehlorpromazine total area single dose eurves area experimental part eurve aot ealculated trapezoidal rule dahl strandjord e ol c c  c u c u ro e e cl       patient single doses mg i m cpz mg orally  cpz  c pzsa   day day clinical pharmacology therapeutics multiple oral dosing mg x  cpz c o cpzsa olw 6 j j j l l time dose hr fig results patient see legend fig total clearanee relative f single multiple doses ci f  aooo c f  a 2 apparent volume distribution relative f single multiple doses vÌÙ f   aooo   v ÌÙ f   a 12  biologie availability single oral relative single intramuseular doses fpo ao oo d po firn ao oo d im doses estimates biologie chlorpromazine standard deviation estimate ealculated eaeh subjeet linear regression analysis detennined logarithms three eoneentrations measured hr single doses four eoneentrations measured hr last maintenanee dose mean single oral dose single intramuseular dose used estimating area extrapolated part eurves eq eaeh subjeet,,Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial,Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial
8148222,Disposition of clozapine in man: lack of association with debrisoquine and S-mephenytoin hydroxylation polymorphisms.,"A large interindividual variability has previously been demonstrated in the bioavailability, steady-state plasma concentrations and clearance of clozapine, an atypical neuroleptic drug. To evaluate the importance of genetic factors in the metabolism of clozapine, its disposition after a single oral dose of 10 mg was studied in 15 healthy Caucasian volunteers. Five of the subjects were poor metabolisers (PM) of debrisoquine, five were PM of S-mephenytoin, and the remaining five were extensive metabolisers (EM) of both probe drugs. There was a 10-fold interindividual variation in Cmax and a 14-fold variation in AUC(0, 24) of clozapine among the 15 subjects studied. The mean (s.d.) Cmax was 117 (81) nmol l-1 and the mean AUC(0,24) value was 890 (711) nmol l-1 h. The value of t1/2,z varied 3-fold with a mean (s.d.) of 13.3 (5.0) h. There were no significant differences in the plasma concentrations or any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of clozapine between PM and EM of debrisoquine, or between the two S-mephenytoin hydroxylation phenotypes. We conclude that neither of the major genetic polymorphisms of oxidative drug metabolism contribute to the large interindividual variability in clozapine pharmacokinetics.",Phenotype Pharmacokinetic Trials, methods fifteen healthy swedish subjects seven women eight men aged years weighing kg took part study recruited population healthy volunteers previously phenotyped respect debrisoquine mephenytoin hydroxylation polymorphisms debrisoquine hydroxylation phenotype determined according mahgoub et al oral intake pharmacology karolinska institute huddinge hospital l dahl et al mg debrisoquine hemisulphate declinax hoffmanlaroche co ag basel switzerland urine collected h drug intake analysed debrisoquine hydroxydebrisoquine gas chromatography metabolic ratio mr debrisoquine defined ratio urinary recovery debrisoquine oh debrisoquine h urine sample subjects mr greater classified pm mephenytoin hydroxylation phenotype determined simultaneously debrisoquine according sanz et al r enantiomeric ratio mephenytoin determined gas chromatography h well h urine samples collected intake mg racemic mephenytoin mesantoin sandoz basel switzerland subjects r ratio h urines classified pm extensive metabolisers em ratios subjects chosen include five pm debrisoquine em mephenytoin five pm mephenytoin em debrisoquine five em probe drugs em debrisoquine debrisoquine mr therefore represented rapid metabolisers within em phenotype subjects healthy assured medical history physical examination electrocardiogram routine laboratory analysis pm em groups differ respect age weight one subjects pm mephenytoin smoker cigarettes per day drug free least weeks study informed consent obtained subjects study approved ethics committee huddinge hospital overnight fast volunteers ingested single oral dose mg clozapine capsule form clozapine available dose units less mg mg capsules prepared pharmacy department huddinge hospital grounding mg clozapine tablets leponex sandoz basel switzerland mg dose clozapine chosen pilot study two healthy volunteers em debrisoquine mephenytoin received single oral mg mg dose clozapine respectively subjects experienced marked sedation orthostatic hypotension dizziness therefore dose mg clozapine chosen study venous blood samples ml drawn h drug intake plasma separated centrifugation stored frozen c analysed clozapine volunteers stayed hospital first h drug intake blood pressure heart rate side effects recorded regularly study plasma concentrations clozapine measured gas chromatography mass spectrometry propyln norclozapine used internal standard limit assay nmol coefficient variation concentration terminal elimination half life tå_ z calculated least squares linear regression analysis log plasma drug concentration time data beyond h auc values h auc estimated using linear trapezoidal rule student test unpaired data spearman rank correlation test used statistical analysis p value less regarded statistically significant,,Phenotyped PK Trial,Phenotype PK Trial
