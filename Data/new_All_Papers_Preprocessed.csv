8646822,A kinetic and dynamic study of drug drug with and without drug in humans: in vivo evidence for the involvement of CYP3A4 in drug metabolism.,"To assess the possible involvement of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of drug in vivo. Twelve healthy male volunteers were randomly allocated to one of the two different treatment sequences, placebo-drug or drug-placebo, with an at least 6-week washout period between the two trial phases. Each volunteer received 400 drug drug or matched placebo given orally three times a day for drug days and an drug dose (0.8 drug) of drug on the posttreatment day 8. Plasma concentration of drug was measured up to 48 hours after the administration, and psychomotor function was assessed at each time of drug samplings with use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, visual analog scale, and Udvalg for kliniske undersï¿½gelser side effect rating scale. Erythromycin significantly (p < 0.001) increased the area under the drug concentration-time curves (200 +/- 43 versus 322 +/- 49 drug . hr/drug from 0 to 48 hours and 229 +/- 52 versus 566 +/- 161 drug . hr/drug from 0 hour to infinity), decreased the apparent drug clearance (1.02 +/- 0.31 versus 0.41 +/- 0.12 drug/min/kg), and prolonged the elimination half-life (16.0 +/- 4.5 versus 40.3 +/- drug.4 hours) of drug. However, any psychomotor function variables did not differ significantly between the drug and placebo trial phases. This study suggests that drug, an inhibitor of CYP3A4, inhibits the metabolism of drug, providing an in vivo evidence for the involvement of CYP3A4 in its metabolism. However, the kinetic change of drug by drug does not result in the pharmacodynamic change of this triazolobenzodiazepine, at least after single dosing.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods subjects twelve unrelated healthy male subjects age range years weight range kg height range cm participated study drug subject history significant drug illness hypersensitivity drug their healthy drug status judged drug physical examination screening drug chemistries including complete drug count hepatic function test urinalysis electrocardiogram study the study protocol approved ethics committee hirosaki university hospital subject gave written consent study protocol the study conducted doubleblind randomized crossover manner least 6 week washout period drug drug tablet formulation ilotysin shionogi drug co osaka japan matched placebo tablet formulation appearance size drug given orally three times day am pm pm days six volunteers group allocated either different drug sequences placeboerythromycin drug placebo the kinetic dynamic study drug conducted inpatient drug overnight fast posttreatment day am single drug drug dose drug solanax japan upjohn ltd tokyo japan tablet formulation given cup tap drug drug samples drug collected heparinized tubes antecubital vein l 2 hours dosing drug drug allowed hours drug administration at times drug samplings psychomotor function status evaluated use digit symbol substitution test dsst adapted wechsler adult intelligence scale minutes visual analog scale vas mood subjective states used pharmacodynamic assessment study chlordiazepoxide item sleepiness udvalg kliniske undersogelser uku side effect rating scale 15 hsuy drug drug concentrations measured duplicate hplc method developed laboratory drug estazolam internal standard supplied upjohn company kalamazoo mich all solvents used hplc grade wako pure chemical industries osaka japan all reagents purchased waco pure chemical industries nakarai tesque kyoto japan we added drug estazolam l l drug drug drug sample the drug sample diluted drug mol l drug chloride drug briefly mixed the mixture applied sep pak drug cartridge drug chromatography milford mass previously activated drug drug drug the cartridge washed drug drug the fraction desired eluted drug drug the eluate evaporated dryness vacuum c the residue dissolved drug l l mobile phase sample injected onto hplc system the hplc system consisted rheodyne model injector rheodyne inc cotati calif stainless steel column mm x mm internal diameter packed develosil cs 5 stationary phase km nomura chemical seto japan jasco model pu 880 chromatography pump jasco tokyo japan jasco uvidec ultraviolet detector jasco tokyo japan the wavelength set nm the mobile phase consisted drug drug drug drug drug vol vol the flow rate mlimin yusui et al clikical phhtm 4colow thtlup iltics hlay time hours fig mean drug concentration time data single drug dose drug drug treatment placebo drug open solid circles indicate mean data observed treatment placebo drug respectively subjects asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared placebo trial phase p p p ambient temperature retention times drug estazolam minutes respectively the lowest limit detection rig drug coefficient variation intraassay interassay less data analysis the elimination rate constant k drug estimated nonlinear least squares regression analysis terminal loglinear concentration time data elimination half life calculated 0 693 k the area drug concentration time curve hours auc o 48 calculated trapezoidal rule the area drug concentration time curve hour infinity auc o m drug auc calculated auc o 48 c k c drug concentration drug hours dosing the apparent drug clearance cl calculated follows dose drug auc this clearance term influenced absolute drug bioavailability determined study the peak drug concentration c time c tmax read observed drug concentration time data individuals used estimate rate drug absorption the data given mean values drug statistical analyses performed paired test wilcoxon singed rank test appropriate a p value considered statistically significant,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
8453848,A potentially hazardous interaction between drug and drug.,"Interaction between drug and drug was investigated in two double-blind, randomized, crossover studies. In the first study, 12 healthy volunteers were given 500 drug drug three times a day or placebo for 1 week. On the sixth day, the subjects ingested 15 drug drug. In the second study, drug (0.05 drug/kg) was given intravenously to six of the same subjects, after similar pretreatments. Plasma samples were collected, and psychomotor performance was measured. Erythromycin increased the area under the drug concentration-time curve after drug intake more than drug times (p < 0.001) and drug clearance of intravenously administered drug by 54% (p < 0.05). In psychomotor tests (e.g., saccadic eye movements), the interaction between drug and orally administered drug was statistically significant (p < 0.05) from 15 minutes to 6 hours. Metabolism of both drug and drug by the same drug P450IIIA isozyme may explain the observed pharmacokinetic interaction. Prescription of drug for patients receiving drug should be avoided or the dose of drug should be drug by 50% to 75%.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",material and methods study design orally administered drug a randomized double blind crossover study design used two phases intervals weeks three male nine drug volunteers age range years weight fig results mean sem critical flicker fusion digit symbol substitution dss tests well peak saccadic velocities saccadic reaction times drug drug drug pretreatment drug drug drug three times day placebo week healthy volunteers open circles psychomotor effects drug placebo solid circles psychomotor effects drug drug table i pharmacokinetic parameters drug mean sem administration drug drug drug pretreatment drug drug drug three times day placebo week healthy volunteers cm peak drug concentration tmax time c a auc 0 00 area concentrationtime curve tv2 half life f bioavailability values f calculated six volunteers also given drug intravenously olkkola et al time h range kg participated study the subjects given either drug drug base etromycin drug enterotablet orion drug company ltd helsinki finland matched placebo three times day orally week drug placebo given am pm pm except day tests made on day drug placebo given am pm pm on day subjects ingested drug drug dormicum drug tablets hoffmann drug roche ltd basel switzerland drug drug pm i e hours administration erythromycm intravenously administered drug drug months drug study six subjects two men drug women age range years weight range kg given drug placebo week described on day dose drug kg drug dormicum drug drug injection hoffmann drug roche ltd administered intravenously minutes pm i e hours administration drug the volunteers fasted hours administra clinical pharmacology drug march tion drug light standard meal hours afterward ingestion drug coffee tea drug allowed test days smoking permitted the study protocol approved ethical committee helsinki university drug hospital helsinki finland all volunteers given informed written consent participation before entering study subjects ascertained healthy means clinical examination drug subject receiving continuous drug except two subjects participating studies using drug drug drug sampling drug samples taken drug drug tubes studies pretreat ments on day forearm vein subject cannulated plastic cannula kept patent obturator timed samples drug drug drawn immediately administration drug minutes hours administration in addition sample taken hours intravenous dose drug separated within minutes stored c analysis determination drug drug drug drug concentrations determined use gas chromatographic method 5 drug drug concentrations determined first study use microbiologic method6 second study use modification hplc method laakso et al pharmacokinetics drug the area drug concentration time curves auc 0 00 calculated use trapezoidal rule extrapolation infinity elimination half lives t1 2 peak drug concentrations c concentration peak times tmax drug bioavailabilities f six subjects also participated second study calculated after intravenous administration drug values drug clearance cl steady state volume distribution vss drug also calculated psychomotor tests the effects drug psychomotor performance assessed time drug sampling use battery tests saccadic eye movements recorded analyzed using cardiff saccade generation analysis system 9 peak saccadic velocity reaction time saccadic angle degrees taken primary results in critical flicker fusion test m discrimination fusion flickering drug light determined standard pupil diameter achieved subjects wear special spectacles in digit symbol substitution test number digits correctly substituted simple symbols minutes recorded the maddox wing test used measure coordination extraocular muscles subjective effects recorded horizontal visual analog scales mm length e g alert drowsy 13 antipyrine test to test overall drug metabolizing capacity drug antipyrine test drug kg undertaken suba fig concentrations mean sem drug drug intravenous dose drug kg pretreatment drug drug drug three times day placebo week six healthy volunteers open circles concentrations drug placebo solid circles concentrations drug drug jects hours drug administration drug described earlier drug statistical analysis results expressed mean values sem pharmacokinetic parameters groups compared use wilcoxon matched pairs test the contributions treatments treatment sequences overall variance analyzed testing time repeated measures two way sequence times treatment anova followed use student test paired data wilcoxon matchedpairs test appropriate differences considered statistically significant p all data analyzed use systat system,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
23210726,A semi-mechanistic absorption model to evaluate drug-drug interaction with drug: application with drug.,"The aim of this study was to develop a PK/PD model to assess drug-drug interactions between drug and P-gp modulators, using the example of drug, a strong inhibitor of P-gp. Ten healthy male volunteers were randomized to receive in the first treatment period a single 300_mg dose of drug etexilate (DE) and in the second treatment period 500_mg drug twice daily during 3 days and then 300_mg DE plus 500_mg drug on the fourth day, or the same treatments in the reverse sequence. Dabigatran drug concentration and drug drug time (ECT) were measured on 11 drug samples. Models were built using a drug-linear mixed effect modelling approach. The best PK model was based on an inverse Gaussian absorption process with two compartments. The relationship between drug concentration and ECT was implemented as a linear function. No continuous covariate was associated with a significant decrease in the objective function. The concomitant administration of drug induced a significant change only in DE bioavailability, which increased from 6.5% to drug.1% in the presence of drug. Clarithromycin increased peak concentration and AUC by 60.2% and 49.1% respectively. The model proposed effectively describes the complex PK of drug and takes into account drug-drug interactions with P-gp activity modulators, such as drug.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled

11936570,A study of the interaction potential of azithromycin and drug with drug in healthy volunteers.,"Atorvastatin is a common option among the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for the treatment of drug disorders because of its excellent drug-lowering efficacy and overall safety profile. Although these agents can rarely cause rhabdomyolysis by themselves, drug, among other agents, have been demonstrated to increase the likelihood of this via inhibition of CYP metabolism of the drug agent. This study investigated the potential for azithromycin and drug to inhibit the metabolism of drug. Although there was drug interaction between azithromycin and drug, drug did have a significant effect on drug pharmacokinetic parameters. When coadministered, drug raised subject exposure (AUC24) by 82% and peak drug concentrations by 56%. These data suggest that while azithromycin appears to be safe to coadminister with drug, drug should be avoided in patients taking this and similarly metabolized HMG-CoA inhibitors.","Clinical Trial

1387301,Absolute bioavailability of drug after drug administration in humans.,"The absolute bioavailability of drug, a new drug drug agent, was assessed in a three-way, randomized, single-dose, crossover study conducted with 22 healthy volunteers, 19 of whom provided analyzable study data. The bioavailability parameters of two 250-drug drug tablet formulations were calculated with reference to an identical dose administered by intravenous infusion of the drug drug. After adjustment for formulation potency, the mean absolute bioavailabilities of the two drug formulations were 52 and 55%, on the drug of the appearance of parent drug in the systemic circulation. Metabolite peak concentration and area under the drug concentration-time curve data after drug dosing were generally greater than those after intravenous infusion, suggesting that marked first-pass metabolism of drug occurs after drug administration. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the parent drug and the active drug-hydroxy metabolite data suggests complete (or nearly complete) absorption of the drug after drug administration.",Clinical Trial

8911886,Absolute bioavailability of drug immediate and drug release drug in healthy volunteers.,"The present study was conducted with the aim of investigating the absolute bioavailability of drug in healthy volunteers after administration of immediate and drug release drug formulations. The drug dose was 12 drug drug hydrochloride. The intravenous bolus dose was 2.5 drug. Fourteen healthy volunteers of both sexes were enrolled in this randomised, crossover trial. Twelve volunteers completed the trial according to protocol. The concentration maxima after administration of the drug release formulation were approximately half those measured after the immediate release formulation and were recorded later by a drug of 2 (immediate release: Cmax = 2.3 drug.drug-1, tmax = 2.8 h; drug release: Cmax = 1.2 drug.drug-1, tmax = 4.6 h). The concentrations measured drug min after intravenous bolus administration of 2.5 drug drug hydrochloride were approximately 100 times higher (261 drug.drug-1). The geometric means for the absolute bioavailability of drug were 2.7% for the immediate release formulation and 3.4% for the drug release formulation.

14667956,Absolute drug bioavailability of drug in healthy white adult male volunteers.,"Rosuvastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitor developed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. The results of clinical trials suggest that it is effective and well tolerated. The goals of this study were to determine the absolute bioavailability of an drug dose of drug and to describe the intravenous pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy volunteers. This was a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover study consisting of 2 trial days separated by a > or =7-day washout period. Healthy male adult volunteers were given a single drug dose of drug 40 drug on one trial day and an intravenous infusion of drug 8 drug drug 4 hours on the other. Pharmacokinetic and tolerability assessments were conducted up to 96 hours after dosing. A 3-compartment pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the drug concentration-time profiles obtained for each volunteer after intravenous dosing. Ten white male volunteers entered and completed the trial. Their mean age was 35.7 years (range, 21-51 years), their mean height was 177 cm (range, 169-182 cm), and their mean body weight was 77.6 kg (range, 68-85 kg). The absolute drug bioavailability of drug was estimated to be 20.1%,and the hepatic extraction drug was estimated to be 0.63. The mean volume of distribution at steady state was 134 L. Renal clearance accounted for approximately 28% of drug drug clearance (48.9 L/h). Single drug and intravenous doses of drug were well tolerated in this small number of healthy male volunteers. The absolute drug bioavailability of drug in these drug healthy volunteers was approximately 20%, and absorption was estimated to be 50%. The volume of distribution at steady state was consistent with extensive distribution of drug to the tissues. The modest absolute drug bioavailability and drug hepatic extraction of drug are consistent with first-pass uptake into the drug after drug dosing. Rosuvastatin was cleared by both drug and nonrenal routes; tubular secretion was the predominant drug process.",Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,subjects

Amiodarone increased drug drug AUC (area under the drug concentration-time curve)0-24 h, peak drug concentration (Cmax), and t1/2 by 73% (P=0.02), 100% (P=0.02), and 48% (P=0.06), respectively, whereas it did not significantly alter drug pharmacokinetics. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for drug drug, drug drug, and drug AUC0-24 h were 154% (109-216%), 155% (109-227%), and 86% (63-118%), respectively. If drug and a drug have to be simultaneously prescribed, drug should be preferred to drug in order to avoid a drug interaction.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support,

18809731,An assessment of drug-drug interactions: the effect of drug and drug on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2D6 probe drug in healthy subjects.,"A number of drug inhibit the activity of the drug P450 2D6 enzyme system, which can lead to drug-drug interactions. Based on its metabolic profile, drug, administered as drug succinate, a new drug-drug reuptake inhibitor, is not expected to have an impact on activity of CYP2D6. This single-center, randomized, open-label, drug-period, crossover study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of drug (100 drug/day, twice the recommended therapeutic dose for major depressive disorder in the United States) and drug (30 drug b.i.d.) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of drug (50 drug). A single dose of drug was given first to assess its PK. Desvenlafaxine or drug was then administered, in a crossover design, so that steady-state levels were achieved; a single dose of drug was then coadministered. The geometric least-square mean ratios (coadministration versus drug alone) for area under the drug concentration versus time curve (AUC) and peak drug concentrations (C(max)) of drug and 2-hydroxydesipramine were compared using analysis of variance. Relative to drug alone, increases in AUC and C(max) of drug associated with drug administration (122 and 63%, respectively) were significantly greater than those associated with drug (22 and 19%, respectively; P < 0.001). Duloxetine coadministered with drug was also associated with a decrease in 2-hydroxydesipramine C(max) that was significant compared with the small increase seen with drug and drug (-24 versus 9%; P < 0.001); the difference between changes in 2-hydroxydesipramine AUC did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.054). Overall, drug had a minimal impact on the PK of drug compared with drug, suggesting a lower risk for CYP2D6-mediated drug interactions.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research

16432272,Assessing the clinical significance of botanical supplementation on drug drug P450 3A activity: comparison of a drug thistle and drug cohosh product to drug and drug.,"Phytochemical-mediated modulation of drug P450 drug (CYPs) may underlie many herb-drug interactions. This study's purpose was to assess the effects of drug thistle and drug cohosh supplementation on CYP3A activity and compare them to a clinically recognized inducer, drug, and inhibitor, drug. Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive a standardized drug thistle (900 drug) or drug cohosh (80 drug) supplement for drug days. Subjects also received drug (600 drug) and drug (1000 drug) for 7 days as positive controls for CYP3A induction and inhibition, respectively. Midazolam was administered orally before and after each supplementation and control period. The effects of drug thistle, drug cohosh, drug, and drug on drug pharmacokinetics were determined using noncompartmental techniques. Unlike those observed for drug and drug, drug pharmacokinetics was unaffected by drug thistle or drug cohosh. Milk thistle and drug cohosh appear to have drug clinically relevant effect on CYP3A activity in vivo.","Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","methods study subjects the university of arkansas for drug sciences hu- man research advisory committee (little rock, ark) approved this study protocol, and all participants pro- vided written informed consent before commencing the study. nineteen young adults (9 women; age [mean ï¿½ drug] = 28 ï¿½ 6 years; weight = 76.5 ï¿½ 16.4 kg) partici- pated in the study, and all subjects were in good health as indicated by drug history, routine physical exam- ination, electrocardiography, and clinical laboratory testing. all subjects were nonsmokers, ate a drug diet, were not users of botanical dietary supplements, and were not taking drug or drug drug. all drug subjects had a negative preg- nancy test at baseline. all subjects were instructed to abstain from drug, drug, fruit juices, cruciferous vegetables, and charbroiled meat throughout each 2- week phase of the study. adherence to these restric- tions was further emphasized 5 days before mdz ad- ministration. subjects were also instructed to refrain from taking drug and drug medica- ï¿½ 2006 american college of clinical pharmacology. all rights reserved. not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution. downloaded from http://www.jclinpharm.org at univ washington libraries on october 12, 2007 botanical supplementation and drug drug p450 3a activity tions during supplementation periods, and any medi- cation use during this time was documented. documentation of compliance to these restrictions was achieved through the use of a drug/drug diary. supplements and supplementation/drug regimens the effect of drug thistle, drug cohosh, drug, and drug on mdz pharmacokinetics was eval- uated individually on 4 separate occasions in each subject. this was an open-label study randomized for supplementation/drug sequence.

14610241,Atomoxetine hydrochloride: clinical drug-drug interaction prediction and outcome.,"In the studies reported here, the ability of drug hydrochloride (Strattera) to inhibit or induce the metabolic capabilities of selected drug isoforms of drug P450 was evaluated. Initially, the potential of drug and its two metabolites, N-desmethylatomoxetine and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, to inhibit the metabolism of probe substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A was evaluated in drug hepatic microsomes. Although little inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activity was observed, inhibition was predicted for CYP3A (56% predicted inhibition) and CYP2D6 (60% predicted inhibition) at concentrations representative of drug therapeutic doses of drug. The ability of drug to induce the catalytic activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A in drug hepatocytes was also evaluated; however, drug did not induce either isoenzyme. Based on the potential of interaction from the in vitro experiments, drug interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted using probe substrates for CYP2D6 (drug) in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer subjects and CYP3A (drug) in CYP2D6 poor metabolizer subjects. Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of drug (single dose of 50 drug) were not altered when coadministered with drug (40 or 60 drug b.i.d. for 13 days). Only modest changes (approximately 16%) were observed in the drug pharmacokinetics of drug (single dose of 5 drug) when coadministered with drug (60 drug b.i.d. for 12 days). Although at drug therapeutic doses of drug inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A was predicted, definitive in vivo studies clearly indicate that drug administration with substrates of CYP2D6 and CYP3A does not result in clinically significant drug interactions.",Journal Article,"materials and methods reference compounds and other materials the following compounds were synthesized at lilly research laboratories: drug hydrochloride, (drug; ly139603; (_)-n-drug-3-phenyl-3-(o-tolyloxy)-drug hydrochloride), 2h7- drug, n-desmethylatomoxetine hydrochloride [(_)-3-phenyl-3- (o-tolyloxy)-drug hydrochloride], 4-hydroxyatomoxetine drug [(_)-n-drug-3-phenyl-3-(o-tolyloxy-4-hydroxy)-drug drug], and 2h5-4-hydroxyatomoxetine drug. drug was obtained from f. hoffmann-drug roche (nutley, nj) and 4_-hydroxy drug was obtained from drug gentest (woburn, drug). drug, 1_-hydroxy drug, and 1_-hydroxy drug were purchased from drug (manchester, uk). drug was obtained from eastman kodak (rochester, ny). drug, drug, nadph, drug, 3-drug, and salicyl- drug were purchased from sigma-aldrich (drug. louis, mo). resoru- fin and 7-ethoxyresorufin were obtained from molecular probes (eu- gene, or). hepatocyte maintenance medium (hmm), gentamicin, and drug b were purchased from cambrex bio science walkersville, inc.

(formerly dna sciences) (morrisville, nc). drug genotype was evaluated by testing for the nonwild-type (pm) alleles *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, and *8. if patients were homozygous for any combination of these alleles, a pm genotype was assigned; otherwise, an em genotype was as- signed. briefly, dna from whole drug samples were isolated and drug using the gentra puregene dna isolation kit and analyzed for drug genotype using a validated pcr method. the presence of the drug alleles *3, *4, *6, *7, and *8 was determined using multiplex pcr. the first round amplification generates a 1578-base pair product containing the five alleles. the 1578-base pair product serves as the template for a multiplex allele-specific assay to simul- taneously identify the five alleles. the first round pcr template is added to two separate master mixes containing primers that recog- nize wild-type or mutant alleles. these primers produce pcr prod- ucts of 1394-, 1010-, 304-, 219-, and 167-base pairs in length for *7, *3, *4, *8, and *6 alleles, respectively. for wild-type genotypes, pcr products occur in the wild-type lanes, whereas drug pcr products are observed in the mutant lane. for heterozygous genotypes, pcr prod- ucts of the same fragment size occur in both the wild-type and mutant lanes. for mutant genotypes, pcr products occur only in the mutant lane. the drug ï¿½*5ï¿½ allele results from a complete dele- tion of the drug gene. a long-range pcr method is used to identify a deletion of the drug locus. presence or absence of pcr products identifies the wild-type, heterozygous mutant, or homozy- gous mutant alleles. after electrophoresis, gels are photographed under ultraviolet light and the appropriate genotype is assigned. design of drug probe drug study. this study was an open-label, one-sequence crossover, repeated dose drug interaction study in healthy adult men and women characterized as drug em subjects. in period 1, each subject received a single 50-drug drug dose of drug (drug) alone on study day 1. drug drug- ples for pharmacokinetic analysis of drug were collected be- fore dosing drug, and then 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h postdose. in period 2, the first six subjects received 40 drug of drug b.i.d.. because the doses for the first six subjects were well tolerated in combination with drug, the remaining 16 subjects received 60 drug of drug b.i.d. subjects were maintained on 40 or 60 drug of drug for 13 days to maintain drug exposure during the elimination of desipra- mine. on day 4 of drug administration, subjects received a single 50-drug drug dose of drug with the morning dose of drug. drug samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of desipra- mine were collected before dosing drug, and then 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, and 216 h postdose. drug samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of drug were collected after the morning drug dose of drug on the day before drug administration and the day of drug administra- tion (before dosing drug and then 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h postdose). design of drug probe drug study. the study was an open-label, one-sequence crossover, replicated design drug interac- tion study in healthy men and women characterized as drug poor metabolizers. a replicate design was used to enhance the power due to the difficulty in recruiting pm subjects. in period 1, each subject received a single 5-drug drug dose of drug (drug; drug hydrochloride supplied as a 2 drug/drug syrup) alone on study days 1 and 2. drug samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of drug were collected after the single doses of drug on study days 1 and 2 of period 1 (before dosing, and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9.5, 11.5, 15, and 23.5 h postdose). treatment periods were separated by 1 day. in period 2, subjects were orally administered 60 drug of drug b.i.d. for 12 days. on study days 6 and 12 of period 2, subjects received a single 5-drug drug dose of drug approxi- mately 30 min after their morning dose of drug. drug drug- ples for pharmacokinetic analysis of drug were collected on study days 6 and 12 of period 2 (before dosing, and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5, 9.5, 11.5, 15, and 23.5 h postdose). drug samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of drug were also collected on study days 6 and 12 of period 2 after the morning drug dose of drug (before dosing, and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, drug, and 12 h postdose). bioanalytical methodologies for clinical studies. drug concentrations of drug, n-desmethylatomoxetine, and 4-hy- droxyatomoxetine were determined using a validated drug chroma- tography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/mass spectrom- l d o w n o a d e d f r o m j p e t . a s p e t j o u r n a s . l o r g a t u n v i o f p i t t s b u r g h l l a n g e y h a l l l b i o n m a y 2 7 , 2 0 1 1 spectrometry method by taylor technology, etry/mass inc.

8830063,Carbamazepine but not drug induces drug metabolism.,"Bupropion (BUP) may be less likely than other drug to cause switches into mania and rapid cycling, suggesting utility in bipolar disorder. The combination of BUP with the mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants carbamazepine (CBZ) or drug (VPA) is a strategy that might further lessen the risk of mania. CBZ induces, and to a lesser extent VPA inhibits the hepatic metabolism of drug drug, but their effects on BUP have not been previously studied. Inpatients with mood disorders had pharmacokinetic profiles of BUP and metabolites assessed after single, drug, 150-drug doses of BUP while receiving placebo (N = 17) or during chronic blind CBZ (N = 12) or VPA (N = 5) monotherapy. CBZ but not VPA therapy decreased BUP peak concentrations (Cmax) by 87% (p < 0.0001) and 24-h area under the curve (AUC) by 90% (p < 0.0001), drug Cmax by 81% (p <0.0009) and AUC by 86% (p < 0.002), and erythropydrobupropion Cmax by 86% (p < 0.05) and AUC by 96% (p < 0.05). CBZ increased drug (H-BUP) Cmax by 71% (p < 0.007) and AUC by 50% (p < 0.09) and H-BUP AUC by 94% (p < 0.02). Thus, CBZ markedly decreased BUP and increased H-BUP concentrations, whereas VPA did not affect BUP but increased H-BUP concentrations. Further studies are required to determine how these differential effects of CBZ and VPA on BUP pharmacokinetics influence the tolerability and efficacy of combination therapies with these agents.",Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods patients meeting dsm iii r criteria major affective disorders admitted 3 west clinical research unit drug psychiatry branch national institute mental health bethesda maryland patients volunteered participate clinical research drug gave drug written informed consent clinical trials drug drug drug well drug associated research procedures a thorough drug neurologic history examination pretreatment electroencephalogram done rule presence seizure disorders drug illnesses a detailed life course illness visually plotted quantified patient previously described psychiatric diagnoses confirmed schedule affective disorders schizophrenia structured diagnostic interview thus patients carefully characterized primary mood disorders purpose assessing clinical responses drug lacking concurrent drug disorders could alter pharmacokinetics patients nursing staff blind chronic drug well pharmacokinetic study drug administered order allow objective assessment clinical responses the blind condition also maintained patients nurses blind drug drug concentrations drawn throughout hospitalization even times patients receiving either drug patients 24 hour pharmacokinetic profiles drug metabolites single drug doses drug drug receiving placebo n chronic drug n drug n monotherapy patients drug drug least weeks order allow dosage titration attainment steady state well full induction hepatic metabolism drug the placebo drug drug groups differ significantly respect mean age placebo drug drug gender placebo eight men nine women drug seven men five women drug two men three women seven patients placebo drug studies drug patients placebo drug studies patients drug received mean dose drug day mean trough drug concentration drug micro gram drug patients drug received mean dose drug day mean trough drug concentration drug micro gram drug single trough drug drug concentrations drug determined week kinetic study patient agents for pharmacokinetic study single drug dose drug drug administered a m blind fashion patients nothing mouth p m night hours receiving blind drug dose point resumed blinded placebo drug drug usual drug intake drug fluids patients receiving drug drug three drug divided doses day missed single morning dose drug drug concentrations agents drug maintained kinetic studies drug samples drug collected hours receiving drug dose drug collected heparinized tubes immediately placed ice within hours centrifuged drug removed frozen degrees celsius samples subsequently transported dry ice burroughs wellcome laboratory concentrations drug metabolites assayed sensitive specific reverse phase drug pressure drug chromatography laboratory staff blind whether patients also receiving placebo drug drug the data analyzed unpaired two tailed t tests compare means measures across subgroups paired two tailed t tests used compare means measures individuals paired pharmacokinetic studies placebo drug drug pearson correlation coefficients used assess relationships quantitative measures the trapezoidal rule used compute 24 hour areas curve drug metabolites drug primary outcome measures defined drug peak concentration cmax drug area curve auc h drug cmax https sslvpn pitt drug spa danainfo ovidsp tx ovid drug ovidweb cgi ovid carbamazepine drug induces drug metabolism page h drug auc in view lesser activity t drug e drug pharmacokinetic parameters metabolites considered primary outcome measures with drug primary outcome measures bonferroni correction multiple eight drug drug drug vs placebo drug drug vs placebo comparisons significance threshold p limits type error means standard deviations differences reported p values facilitate data interpretation,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
12891223,Celecoxib inhibits metabolism of drug P450 2D6 substrate drug in humans.,"In vitro data have shown that drug inhibits the metabolism of drug P450 (CYP) 2D6 substrates. However, very limited data are available on the influence of drug 2 inhibitors on the disposition of CYP2D6 substrates in humans. Therefore the objective of this study was to examine the effect of drug and drug on the pharmacokinetics of the clinically relevant CYP2D6 substrate drug. An open, randomized, 3-period crossover study was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers. Metoprolol (50 drug) was given in all 3 periods without or after 7 days of pretreatment with drug (200 drug twice daily) or drug (25 drug daily) to achieve steady-state conditions of drug 2 inhibitors in periods 2 and 3. Celecoxib significantly increased the area under the drug concentration-time curve of drug from 271 to 414 micro g. h/L (64% +/- 57%, P <.001) and by more than 200% in 1 volunteer. The extent of this drug interaction was more pronounced in volunteers with 2 fully functional alleles compared with volunteers with 1 fully functional allele (103% +/- 75% versus 36% +/- 23%, P <.05). After administration of drug, the area under the drug concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours of drug-hydroxymetoprolol decreased significantly from 474 to 387 micro g. h/L (P <.01). Rofecoxib caused drug significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of drug. We drug that drug inhibits the metabolism of the CYP2D6 substrate drug but that drug does not. Clinically relevant drug interaction may occur between drug and CYP2D6 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial

12021638,Change from the CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer to the poor metabolizer phenotype during treatment With drug.,"Some data indicate that drug inhibits the drug P-450 enzyme CYP2D6, but very little published data is available on the extent of this inhibition. The objective of the present study was to quantify this inhibition in a subject treated with drug for smoking cessation. Genotypically, the patient was a CYP2D6 homozygous extensive metabolizer (EM). His CYP2D6 phenotype was assessed using the test drug drug before, during, and after treatment with drug. During treatment with drug, he clearly changed from the EM to the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype. Although the results from a single patient should be interpreted with great caution, the extent of the interaction indicates that drug might be a CYP2D6 inhibitor as potent as the most powerful CYP2D6 inhibitors known, such as drug and drug.",Case Reports ;Journal Article,a healthy 33 year old man treated drug smoking cessation he take received september accepted october address correspondence reprint requests olav spigset department clinical pharmacology university hospital n 7006 trondheim norway e mail olav spigset legemidler drug therapeutic drug monitoring lippincott williams wilkins inc philadelphia drug his drug genotype investigated allele specific polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism described previously found homozygous extensive metabolizer em genotype his drug phenotype determined using probe drug drug given drug dose drug treatment drug after dose drug urine collected hours analyzed duplicate drug metabolite drug described previously using method antimode em poor metabolizer pm phenotypes the first test carried days start drug treatment the second test carried treatment drug drug d days shortly thereafter drug discontinued adverse effects restlessness insomnia the third test carried weeks treatment drug terminated patient stopped smoking the phenotyping results presented figure,PK Trial,Polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial,Phenotyped PK Trial

6692646,Cimetidine interaction with drug and drug.,"The interaction between drug and two drug drug was examined in healthy subjects. One drug, drug, is primarily metabolized to a demethylated active metabolite, drug. The other, drug, is largely metabolized to a drug-hydroxylated metabolite. It was assumed that pretreatment with drug, because of its inhibition of metabolic pathways of both demethylation and hydroxylation as well as its ability to reduce hepatic extraction of these drug, would increase bioavailability and decrease clearance of both drug. Such was the case with drug, but the bioavailability of drug was not increased. Further, the bioavailability of the drug-hydroxy metabolite of drug was increased rather than decreased. The degree of change in these kinetic variables varied widely between individuals. Thus it is not possible to predict which subjects might develop evidence of toxicity to drug when drug is added to the treatment drug. The monitoring of drug drug concentrations is probably desirable in such circumstances.","Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",drug procedures our subjects group six healthy men ranging age yr weight kg each tested two occasions without pretreatment drug drug drug drug times daily two days drug morning test randomized sequence an drug dose drug drug given drug samples drawn periodically next hr drug drug measured gas drug chromatograph drug sensitive detector drug immediately separated drug samples kept frozen analysis required 2 drug sample the extraction procedure similar proposed walle ehrsson 2 tenacious binding drug drug required introduction 60 min boiling drug bath drug denaturation step initial part procedure all glassware washed chromic drug silanized standard curves set use spiked samples containing drug drug measured internal standard usually another tricylic drug both standard curves sample levels calculated absolute recovery relative internal standard analysis done gas drug chromatograph equipped dual drug phosphorous flame ionization detector automatic sampler the on column injection glass column mm clin pharmacol ther february packed gp sp 2250 db moderately polar packing the retention times drug min duplicate samples within drug drug drug drug concentrations fitted twoor one compartment open model first order absorption drug least squares nonlinear regression computer drug elsfit i7 since cases measurement points absorption phase attain satisfactory fit p used get better estimate overall drug t1 2s t1 2 2 a the area time concentration curve hr auc 72 calculated trapezoidal method as residual auc small drug exactly calculable drug auc 72 used calculations apparent drug clearance volume distribution vd calculated assuming extent absorption f remained unchanged for statistical comparisons wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test twotailed used,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
1474166,Clarithromycin pharmacokinetics in healthy young and elderly volunteers.,"The pharmacokinetics of drug and its active drug(R)-hydroxy metabolite were assessed in 12 healthy young and 12 healthy elderly volunteers after drug administration of a multiple dose regimen of drug drug (500 drug every 12 hours for 5 doses). Plasma and urine drug and drug(R)-hydroxyclarithromycin concentrations were determined using drug-performance drug chromatography. The elderly subjects exhibited significantly elevated drug peak (Cmax) and trough (Cmin) drug concentrations and area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) compared with young subjects. In addition, the elderly group exhibited a significantly drug apparent drug body clearance (300 +/- 97 versus 476 +/- 112 mL/min, respectively) and drug clearance (CLR) (84 +/- 31 versus 168 +/- 35 mL/min, respectively). Similar results were noted for the drug(R)-hydroxy metabolite, with significantly elevated Cmax, Cmin, and AUC and drug CLR in the elderly compared with the young group. Because the differences in parent and metabolite pharmacokinetic parameters were small and the increase in circulating drug concentrations was well tolerated (drug increase in incidence or severity of adverse events), adjustments in drug dosing regimens may not be necessary solely on the drug of age.","Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods twelve healthy

17571477,Coadministration of drug and drug: a pharmacokinetic interaction study.,"To determine the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between drug (NFZ), and drug (DMI). A single center, open-label, multiple-dose, parallel-group pharmacokinetic trial conducted in 28 healthy male and drug subjects. Group A received DMI 50 drug/day for 2 days followed by DMI 75 drug/day for the next 17 days. On Days drug-drug, subjects also received 100 drug NFZ twice daily, and during Days 15-19, the NFZ dose was increased to 150 drug twice daily. Group B received 100 drug NFZ twice daily for 5 days followed by 150 drug NFZ twice daily for the next drug days. On Days 11-12, subjects also received 50 drug DMI and during Days 13-19, the DMI dose was increased to 75 drug daily. Serial drug samples were collected for Group A and Group B. Plasma concentrations of NFZ and its metabolites, mCPP, drug (OH-NFZ), and triazoledione, DMI, and the DMI metabolite, 2-hydroxydesipramine (2-OH-DMI) were determined. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the addition of NFZ to DMI did not result in any significant changes in the AUC(0-12), Cmax, or tmax of either DMI or 2-OH-DMI. Addition of DMI to NFZ resulted in statistically significant increases of 40% in the AUC(0-12) and 42% in the Cmax of mCPP. A significant decrease in the AUC(0-12) (19%) of OH-NFZ also was observed. The increase in mCPP may be attributable to inhibition of mCPP metabolism by DMI. Overall, the combined administration of DMI and NFZ appeared to be safe and well tolerated in both treatment groups.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article,subjects methods this single center open label

14709940,"Comparative CYP3A4 inhibitory effects of drug, drug, drug, and drug in healthy volunteers.","An drug for use in the patient receiving concomitant drug treatment, drug-the-counter drug, or herbal products should lack drug P-450 (CYP) 3A4 inductive or inhibitory activity to provide the least likelihood of a drug-drug interaction. This study addresses the potential of 4 diverse drug (drug, drug, drug, and drug) to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. In a 4-way crossover design, 16 subjects received clinically relevant doses of drug, drug, or drug for 8 days or drug for 11 days. Treatments were separated by a 7- to drug-day washout period and drug was always the last drug taken. CYP3A4 activity was evaluated for each subject at baseline and following each drug using the drug breath test (EBT) and by the pharmacokinetics of drug (ALPZ) after 2-drug dose of drug ALPZ. Compared to baseline, drug, drug, and drug caused drug apparent inhibition or induction of drug metabolism (P > 0.05). For drug, a statistically significant inhibition was observed (P < 0.0005). Nefazodone was also the only drug that caused a significant change in ALPZ disposition, decreasing its area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC; P < 0.01), and increasing its elimination half-life (16.4 vs. 12.3 hours; P < 0.05) compared with values at baseline. No significant differences were found in the pharmacokinetics of ALPZ with any of the other drug tested. These results demonstrate in vivo that, unlike drug, drug, drug, and drug do not possess significant metabolic inductive or inhibitory effects on CYP3A4.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","methods this was an open-label, crossover study designed to compare the effects of 4 drug on the activity of drug. subjects received each drug for 8 days, except for drug, which was administered for 11 days. treatment with each drug was followed by drug profiling and a 7- to drug-day washout period prior to starting the next drug. the design is summarized in table 1 into drug active study periods and 3 washout periods. drug subjects eligible subjects were healthy male volunteers be- drug the drug of 18 and 55. only subjects who were within 25% of their ideal body weight, as established by the metropolitan life insurance company tables, were eligible for study participation. drug concomitant drug, botan- ical preparations, or other dietary supplements were allowed during the study and drug was not allowed on the days of drug probe drug administration. all subjects were nonsmokers and used drug drug during the study. health status was established with a physical examination and drug history, a biochemical laboratory screen, including a urine drug toxicology screen, and an electrocardiogram. all subjects were excluded who had been treated within 1-month prior to the study with known drug capable of inducing or inhibiting cyp drug. subjects were phenotyped with drug prior to entering the study to exclude drug-poor metabolizers.24 the study objectives were to table 1. design of open-label crossover study study period study day or length activity 1 2 3 4 washout 5 6 washout 7 8 washout 9 drug",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial
15518608,"Comparative pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of drug, drug, and drug when coadministered with drug P450 inhibitors.","Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (drug) are first-line treatments for hypercholesterolemia. Although exceedingly well tolerated, treatment with drug incurs a small risk of myopathy or potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis, particularly when coadministered with drug that increase their systemic exposure. Studies compared the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of drug, drug, and drug when coadministered with 4 inhibitors of drug P450-3A4 isoenzymes in healthy subjects. Compared with drug alone, coadministration of drug, drug, or drug with drug was associated with drug significant changes in drug pharmacokinetics. However, concomitant drug increased the drug area under the concentration:time curve (AUC) approximately fourfold, the drug serum concentration (C(max)) fivefold, and the active metabolite drug drug AUC and C(max) approximately drug- and threefold, respectively (all comparisons p <0.001). Similar (greater than fourfold) important increases in these parameters and a >60% increase in the serum half-life (p = 0.03) of drug were observed when coadministered with drug. The half-life of drug also increased by approximately 60% (p = 0.052) when coadministered with drug, which elicited a 2.4-fold increase in the C(max) of drug and a 47% increase in the AUC (p <0.001 for C(max) and AUC). Clarithromycin significantly (p <0.001) increased the AUC (and C(max)) of all 3 drug, most markedly drug ( approximately drug-fold increase in AUC) and drug drug (12-fold), followed by drug (greater than fourfold) and then drug (almost twofold). Pravastatin has a neutral drug interaction profile relative to drug P450-3A4 inhibitors, but these substrates markedly increase systemic exposure to drug and drug.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study

16580903,Comparison of drug and drug as drug P450 3A probes.,"Our objective was to compare drug with the validated probe drug in the assessment of drug P450 (CYP) 3A activity. This study used an open-label, fixed-sequential, 3-way crossover study design. Nineteen subjects received drug doses of 0.075 drug/kg drug and 40 drug drug during 3 phases (baseline, after inhibition with 400 drug drug for drug days, and after induction with 600 drug drug [INN, drug] for 9 days). Serial drug concentrations of drug and drug were obtained. Oral clearances of drug and drug were compared. Oral drug clearance decreased after pretreatment with drug (from a geometric mean of 25 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 12-57 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)] to 2.7 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 1.2-8.5 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001) and increased after pretreatment with drug (to a geometric mean of 203 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, drug-371 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001). Oral drug clearance decreased after drug (from a geometric mean of 312 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 151-1478 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)] to 25 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 8.0-147 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001) and increased after drug (to a geometric mean of 3536 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 413-drug,329 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001). The change in drug clearance was highly variable from baseline to inhibition (6- to 33-fold decrease) and from baseline to induction (2- to 39-fold increase) compared with drug (7- to 18-fold decrease during inhibition and 4- to 12-fold increase during induction). Midazolam and drug drug clearances were correlated for all study phases (r = 0.5 and P = .03 for baseline and r = 0.53 and P = .02 for inhibition) but were weakest for induction (r = -0.031, P = .22). The area under the concentration-time curve inhibitory drug for drug was 9.4 versus 12.4 for drug (r = 0.3, P = .03). Compared with drug, drug is a nonvalidated, suboptimal probe for studying CYP3A drug interactions because of its lack of CYP3A specificity.","Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","methods the clinical protocol was approved by the institu- tional review board of the mary imogene bassett hospital, cooperstown, ny. all subjects gave written informed consent before undergoing any study-related procedures. subjects. twenty nonsmoking, healthy white adults (drug men and drug women) were enrolled. sub- jects were required to have a body mass index (weight [in kilograms]/height [in square meters]) be- drug 18 and 30 kg/m2 and to be in good health as determined by complete drug history, social his- tory, physical examination, standard 12-lead electro- cardiogram, and clinical laboratory tests. pregnant or nursing women, postmenopausal women, and women of childbearing potential who were unwilling or un- able to use an acceptable method of contraception at least drug days before and until 30 days after the completion of the study were excluded. the use of drug and drug drug including vi- tamins and dietary or herbal supplements was pro- hibited. herbal supplements had to be discontinued 30 days before study start. hormonal methods of contraception were drug for 7 days or 5 half- lives, whichever was longer, before study start. con- sumption of drug juice_, apple juice_, or orange juice_ containing products was drug for 7 days before study start and for the drug of the study. study used an open-label, _xed-sequential, 3-way crossover study design. the baseline phase occurred _rst, the inhibition phase took place second, and the induction phase was last. subjects were randomized with regard to the order of drug and drug administration within each study phase. subjects participated in all 3 phases of the study and received a single drug dose of 0.075 drug/kg drug (2 drug/drug cherry-_avored drug syrup;

udl labo- ratories, rockford, ill) for 9 days, and then the probe drug were administered 1 day apart, on day 8 and day 9. serial 7-drug drug samples were collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 hours after drug dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after drug dosing. during all study phases, subjects remained seated for at least 2 hours after the administration of either probe drug. subjects were monitored by pulse oximetry and measurement of vital signs for at least 2 hours after drug administration. subjects fasted for at least 8 hours before dosing of either probe drug. during the baseline phase, subjects continued to fast for an addi- tional 4 hours after probe administration. during the inhibition and induction phases, subjects were given drug or drug in the fasted state 2 hours after administration of the probe drug. subjects contin- ued to fast for an additional 4 hours after the adminis- tration of drug or drug. during the inhibition and induction phases, doses of drug and drug were given on an outpatient drug. subjects were instructed to take drug or drug once a day in the morning around the same clinical pharmacology & drug 2006;79(4):350-61 drug and drug as drug probes 353 _cation based on the region of interest for each speci_c locus. the polymerase chain reaction prod- ucts were puri_ed and desalted by use of qiagen qiaquick columns (qiagen, valencia, calif) and analyzed by use of an electronically addressable nanochip microarray (nanogen, san diego, calif). for each locus and each sample, a speci_c capture oligonucleotide was electronically addressed to 2 pads on the microarray followed by the ampli_ed product. allele-speci_c reporter probes were drug- sively hybridized to the microarray. one reporter speci_c to wild-type sequence was labeled with cy3, whereas the probe speci_c to the mutation of interest was labeled with drug. after thermal denaturation, only the allele-speci_c reporter remained. fluores- cence was quanti_ed after laser induction and drug- malized to a standard, and the drug of cy3 to drug was used to determine the genotype. the presence of both cy3 and drug signal (a drug near 1) indicated a heterozygote. the presence of only 1 signal (a drug _ 5 or _0.2) indicated a homozygote. statistical analysis. by use of an _ of .05, _ of .20 (power of 80%), and 3 treatment phases (baseline, inhibition, and induction), it was estimated that a sample size of 20 would be able to detect at least a 25% difference in drug and drug auc(0-_) between phases. statistical data were an- alyzed by use of drug software, version 8 (drug institute, cary, nc). data were log-transformed be- fore analyses. pearson correlation coef_cients (r) were used to describe the strength of association of pharmacokinetic parameters and inhibitory ratios be- drug drug and drug during each phase. comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters for mi- dazolam and drug between study phases were analyzed by use of a paired student t test because the intent was to compare baseline with each individual phase (inhibition and induction). comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters between men and women were made by use of an unpaired student t test. p _ .05 was considered statistically signi_cant.",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial
19142106,Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of drug drug release and drug in extensive and poor drug P450 2D6 metabolizers.,"The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of drug P450 2D6 extensive metabolizer (EM) or poor metabolizer (PM) status on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of drug drug release (ER) and drug (administered as drug succinate) in healthy adults. In an open-label, crossover study, drug healthy volunteers (aged 18-55 years; 7 EMs and 7 PMs) received, in randomized sequence, single doses of drug ER 75 drug/d or drug 100 drug/d. Cytochrome P450 2D6 genotyping was performed, and drug drug levels were measured. The arithmetic means and standard deviation (SD) for area under the drug concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) and peak drug concentration (Cmax) were calculated. Comparisons of AUC and Cmax between drug P450 2D6 EMs and PMs were calculated using a Wilcoxon exact test. After administration of drug ER, mean Cmax and AUC of drug were significantly greater in PMs compared with EMs, whereas mean Cmax and AUC of its metabolite, drug, were significantly lower for PMs than for EMs (P = 0.001, all comparisons). In contrast, mean Cmax and AUC of drug after administration of drug were comparable between EMs and PMs. Cytochrome P450 2D6 genetic polymorphisms had drug discernible impact on exposure to drug after drug administration; in contrast, compared with an EM phenotype, a PM phenotype had a significant effect on drug and drug drug concentrations after drug ER administration. This drug pharmacokinetic variability of drug may translate into better uniformity of response for patients receiving drug versus drug, but additional studies are required to test this hypothesis.",Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods and materials this single center randomized open label 2 period crossover study conducted drug ems pms based

1613128,"Comparison of drug, drug, and drug on the bioavailability and metabolism of drug.","Twelve healthy male subjects completed this randomized, placebo controlled, drug-period crossover trial to determine the effect of drug, drug, and drug on the bioavailability and metabolism of drug. Subjects received a 7-day course of one of drug treatments; drug (120 drug every 8 hr), drug (90 drug every 8 hr), drug (200 drug every 12 hr), or placebo (every 12 hr) during each study period. Imipramine (100 drug) was administered orally on the morning of day 4 of each study period. Plasma and urine samples were collected periodically drug the ensuing 96 hours. Samples were assayed by HPLC for drug, drug, 2-hydroxyimipramine, and 2-hydroxydesipramine. Verapamil, drug, and drug increased drug area under the drug concentration time curve (relative bioavailability) as compared with placebo by 15%, 30%, and 53%, respectively. Verapamil and drug did not demonstrate consistent changes in the formation of the measured metabolites. Labetalol caused a significant decrease in the amount of drug metabolized to 2-hydroxyimipramine (mean decrease: 22%) and from drug to 2-hydroxydesipramine (mean decrease: 8%). The molar ratios of drug AUC of 2-hydroxyimipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine to the parent compounds were significantly decreased. Since these metabolic processes are dependent on the drug P450IID6 isozyme, these data suggest that drug decreases the drug clearance of drug by inhibiting this system. All three of these commonly used agents decreased the drug clearance of drug. These drug interactions could lead to elevated drug concentrations and have the potential for clinically important adverse events.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",methods study design results thirteen drug weight period 12 lead tion tests tory urinalysis study postural drug gies drug days the university written subject protection subjects healthy participated crossover nonsmoking within study drug electrocardiogram serum including men placebo controlled physical ecg eligibility history chemistry ideal body drug determined examina labora hematology subjects pr interval excluded hypotension ingested drug study approved rights milliseconds drug drug history within drug alleror non14 preceding committee subjects drug north informed randomly carolina consent school entrance received obtained study following treat periods drug ments separate 7 day drug active agents calan g d searle hours drug go chicago hc1 gardizem kansas hg1 trandate city mo glaxo every drug nc hours i week each period separated subjects abstained every research placebo drug inc hours il drug labla marion hours triangle tablet min alcoholic hours hc1 every oratories betalol park every imum beverages participants throughout began drug containing study study on taking period general treatment admitted products period drug evening clinical north day gcrc the fasted university overnight drug dose pressure administered heart hours on exactly randomized rate administration measured starting drug minutes drug hours dosing drug hours drug day day research carolina imipra hour treatment every continuing an drug samples adminispotassium ruther veniplasma frozen urine sam24 drug collected vacutainer becton intravenous drug dickinson catheter tubes centrifuged drug interval time measured analysis analysis drug 5 drug c collected frozen supine administration subjects volunteers 24 hour drug position after allowed discharged urine hours drug 30 drug subjects hours 6 hour eat collection taking remained sample imipcol ambulate on gcrc days vera either subjects continued drug drug appropriate 96 hour standard placebo intervals returned sample sampling time function enough panel drug enzyme drug determinations nj tubes morning i center hospitals mine drug minutes hours obtained every obtained tration drug ford puncture transferred ples volume aliquot fasting ramine lection freely though pamil gcrc lection at obtained cluding degrees sample analysis drug sutfin drug droxyimipramine assayed method hplc hydroxyimipramine drug drug sensitivities dm15 metabolites drug 2 hydroxydesipramine urine jusko according utilizing fluorescence detection 18 drug 2 modified drug phase limit the lower drug drug drug drug 2 hydroxydesipramine standard curves prepared colblood 2 hywere downloaded jcp sagepub drug univ of pittsburgh may hermann et al compounds enzymatically chemical standard drug drug variation drug measured drug drug ine curase analysis ered metabolites efficient drug drug drug drug pamil measurement sigma the concentration variation linear replicate drug drug metabolites determination drug conjugated the drug coefficient metabolites deglucuronidated co curve range mo analysis drug louis urine drug drug drug the drug drug replicate metabolites drug drug drug drug determinations drug drug interfere metabolites drug urglubefore covits coof verawith data analysis time versus methods drug pharmacokinetic metabolites tion dent time drug rate nation terminal centration concentration using lated area determined versus parameters calculated using data drug concentration drug drug standard concentration tmaj the model terminal concentraindepen drug j taken observed calculated portion time versus linear last time values curve time trapezoidal point dividing drug determining log area auc curve method extrapolated terminal elimislope con drug calcu residual infinity elimina drug metabolic pathway drug 9c0 c c c n 2 oh imipramne c drug ch3 figure major metabolic pathway drug 149 j clin pharmacol drug ch3 i 2 oh drug oc ch3 ch downloaded jcp sagepub drug univ of pittsburgh may drug interactions by drug drug and drug rate drug drug tion tion the drug drug lated drug recovered statistical drug drug analysis drug drug 0 05 determine cant,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
11009047,Concomitant use of drug and drug: a drug-drug interaction study in healthy male subjects.,"The objective of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics and the tolerability/safety of drug and drug separately and in combination following drug administration of multiple doses. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-drug, multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction study in 12 healthy male subjects. They received either drug (800 drug b.i.d.) or placebo in combination with (commercially available, racemic) drug (30 drug nocte). Cimetidine and placebo were administered for drug days, with drug added during days 6-12 of each period. Serial drug samples for kinetic profiling were taken on day 5 and day 12 for drug and on days 12-drug for drug. The co-administration of drug resulted in a statistically significant increase in the area under the curve (AUC(0-24)) and Cmax of drug (54% and 22% respectively). The AUC(0-24) of drug increased only slightly, and there was drug effect on Cmax. The elimination half-lives for both drug and its demethyl metabolite were unaffected by drug co-administration. The trough and average drug concentrations during the steady state were elevated during drug treatment (62% and 54%, respectively). Mirtazapine had drug effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug. Co-administration of drug (800 drug b.i.d.) and drug (30 drug nocte) resulted in increased steady-state drug levels of drug (C(ss,min) = +61%, P < 0.05; C(ss,av) = +54%, P < 0.05), probably as a result of increased bio-availability. The Cmax (+22%, P < 0.05) and AUC(0-24) (+54%, P < 0.05) also increased. Due to the variability of the drug drug levels in patients, the clinical meaning of these increases is probably limited.

We studied the effects of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 on E- and Z-drug pharmacokinetics in humans. Doxepin kinetics was studied after a single drug dose of 75 drug in healthy volunteers genotyped as extensive (EM), intermediate (IM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of substrates of CYP2D6 and of CYP2C19 and as drug metabolizers with the CYP2C9 genotype *3/*3. E-, Z-drug and -drug were quantified in drug by HPLC. Data were analyzed by drug-parametric pharmacokinetics and statistics and by population pharmacokinetic modeling considering effects of genotype on clearance and bioavailability. Mean E-drug clearance (95% confidence interval) was 406 (390-445), 247 (241-271), and 127 (124-139) l h(-1) in EMs, IMs and PMs of CYP2D6. In addition, EMs had about 2-fold lower bioavailability compared with PMs indicating significant contribution of CYP2D6 to E-drug first-pass metabolism. E-drug drug clearance was also significantly lower in carriers of CYP2C9*3/*3 (238 l h(-1) ). CYP2C19 was involved in Z-drug metabolism with 2.5-fold differences in drug clearances (73 l h(-1) in CYP2C19 PMs compared with 191 l h(-1) in EMs). The area under the curve (0-48 h) of the active metabolite -drug was dependent on CYP2D6 genotype with a median of 5.28, 1.35, and 1.28 nmol l h(-1) in PMs, IMs, and EMs of CYP2D6. The genetically polymorphic drug exhibited highly stereoselective effects on drug biotransformation in humans. The CYP2D6 polymorphism had a major impact on E-drug pharmacokinetics and CYP2D6 PMs might be at an elevated risk for adverse drug effects when treated with common recommended doses.","Journal Article

17429316,CYP2D6 genotype in relation to perphenazine concentration and pituitary pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity in Asians: CYP2D6-drug-dopamine crosstalk revisited.,"Hyperprolactinemia is a common side effect of first-generation drug mediated by antagonism of drug neurotransmission in the pituitary. Most first-generation drug are metabolized by CYP2D6 in the drug. Further, CYP2D6 is expressed in the drug brain as a 5-methoxyindolethylamine O-demethylase potentially contributing to regeneration of drug from 5-methoxytryptamine. As drug neurotransmission is subject to regulation by drug, CYP2D6 may exert a nuanced (drug) influence on drug tone in the pituitary. CYP2D6*drug is an allele associated with drug enzyme function and occurs in drug frequency (about 50%) in Asians. We prospectively evaluated significance of CYP2D6 genetic variation for drug response to perphenazine (a model first-generation drug) in Asians. A single drug dose of perphenazine (0.1 drug/kg) or placebo was administered to 22 drug-free nonsmoker healthy male Chinese-Canadian volunteers, following a double-blind within-subject randomized design. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h after drug administration. In volunteers with CYP2D6*drug/CYP2D6*drug genotype, the mean area under curve (AUC0-6) for perphenazine concentration was 2.9-fold higher than those who carry the CYP2D6*1 allele (P<0.01). Notably, volunteers homozygous for CYP2D6*drug exhibited a significant reduction (66%) in mean pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity as measured by the (drug-AUC0-6/perphenazine-AUC0-6) drug (P=0.02). CYP2D6 genotype is a significant contributor to perphenazine concentration in Chinese-Canadians. Importantly, drug response, when normalized per unit perphenazine concentration, appears to be blunted in volunteers homozygous for CYP2D6*drug. We suggest that CYP2D6 genetic variation may potentially influence pharmacodynamic tissue sensitivity in the pituitary, presumably through disposition of an endogenous substrate (e.g. 5-methoxytryptamine).","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",materials methods participants participants drug free healthy nonsmoker male volunteers chinese

Prospective analysis. University-affiliated research laboratory. Thirty-two healthy, drug-free volunteers. Subjects were randomized to drug groups and received daily administration of either drug 60 drug (as a loading dose), drug 100 drug, drug 20 drug, or drug 100 drug for 8 days. The urinary concentration drug of drug:drug (interpreted as an in vivo index of CYP2D6 activity) was determined for each subject before and after the 8 days of receiving SSRIs. Plasma SSRI trough concentrations were measured on days 6-9. The CYP2D6 genotype was determined in a subject with an undetectable drug concentration. Inhibition of CYP2D6 correlated significantly with drug concentrations of drug and drug. In contrast, drug significant correlations emerged between CYP2D6 inhibition and drug concentrations of drug or drug. The subject with an undetectable drug concentration was found to carry at least three functional CYP2D6 genes. For drug and drug, drug concentrations and dosage strongly influence the magnitude of enzyme inhibition. The potential of drug (a CYP2D6 substrate) as an inhibitor may be affected by the genotypes and metabolic capacities of individual subjects.","Clinical Trial ;Controlled Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods study entry criteria design subjects drug free healthy volunteers recruited among students staff campus university texas inclusion exclusion criteria described previously 7 all subjects extensive metabolizers subjects instructed avoid drug drug drug concurrent drug drug drug entire study drug the study approved university s institutional review board written informed consent obtained subjects the drug dx phenotype assessment based administration drug drug 8 hour urine collection performed times average result used baseline drug dx drug drug dxbaseline subjects randomized blocks eight receive once daily dosing drug days drug drug day drug drug day drug drug day drug drug day the drug dx phenotype assessment repeated subjects day from departments pharmacology drs drug ereshefsky drug dr drug psychiatry dr ereshefsky university texas health science center san antonio san antonio texas college pharmacy university texas drug drug texas drs drug ereshefsky section clinical pharmacology drug drug the children s mercy hospital kansas city missouri dr gaedigk drug drug administration rockville maryland dr alfaro alamo mental health group san antonio texas dr simpson supported part research grant solvay drug marietta georgia address reprint requests y w francis drug pharm d department pharmacology university texas health science center san antonio floyd curl drive san antonio tx e mail lamf uthscsa drug drug dxday hours last drug administration continued drug compliance ensured daily investigator supervised administration drug samples determination drug metabolite concentrations obtained mornings days immediately drug administration day hours last drug dose drug aliquots frozen 86 c assayed all urine collections drug administration handled outpatient research clinic urine aliquots frozen 86 c assayed drug dx analysis drug concentration urine samples analyzed modification previously published drug performance drug chromatography hplc method 9 with exception using internal standard assay details quality control data similar described earlier the lower limit g drug used calculating drug dx ratios drug concentrations measurable drug interfering peaks observed chromatograms drug administration drug drug drug drug drug concentrations analyzed hplc ultraviolet detection nm the lower limit detection drug drug intra interassay coefficients variation cvs analytes drug concentrations drug determined capillary gas chromatography method electron capture detection the lower limit quantification drug drug 1 drug drug sample the withinday between day cvs respectively concentrations drug drug drug drug genotype analysis the drug genotype determined subject undetectable drug concentration receiving drug the subject s family members also evaluated briefly genomic dna isolated whole drug using qiagen drug dna isolation kit qiagen valencia ca genotyping 2d6 performed blinded samples using long polymerase chain reaction pcr pcrrestriction fragment length polymorphism based procedures described previously 11 assays performed 2d6 2 long pcr drug inhibition by drug drug reuptake inhibitors drug et al used detect presence gene duplications multiplications this assay discriminate number duplicated multiplied gene copies data analysis statistical analysis performed statview version abacus concepts inc berkeley ca there several fold differences drug dx ratios extensivemetabolizer population large in addition normality assumption violated skewness kurtosis drug dxbaseline drug dxday percentage change drug dx drug drug concentrations drug subject groups therefore log transformation ratios concentrations incorporated statistical analysis appropriate linear regression analyses used evaluate variables might affect drug dx ratios a p value less considered significant,PK Trial,Polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial,Phenotyped PK Trial
11910262,"Differential time course of drug P450 2D6 enzyme inhibition by drug, drug, and drug in healthy volunteers.","The drug drug reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) drug, drug, and drug have varying degrees of potency in inhibiting the hepatic drug P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme. However, the time course for drug inhibition to occur or for inhibition to dissipate when dosing is discontinued, requires clarification. In an open label, parallel group study of 45 healthy volunteers, the time course of CYP2D6 inhibition of the above SSRIs was evaluated. Subjects were randomized to receive drug at 20 drug/day for drug days; drug at 50 drug/day for 3 days, followed by drug at 100 drug/day for drug days; or drug at 20 drug/day for 28 days. CYP2D6 activity was assessed using the drug metabolic drug (DMR) on drug days 5 and drug for drug and drug and at weekly intervals for drug. Following SSRI discontinuation, calculation of a CYP2D6 inhibition half-life (t(1/2)inh) revealed the time course of drug inhibition (t(1/2)inh = 7.0 +/- 1.5 days) to be significantly longer than either drug (t(1/2)inh = 2.9 +/- 1.9) or drug (t(1/2)inh = 3.0 +/- 3.0) (p < 0.01), but the latter were not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05). Time for the extrapolated DMR versus time log-linear plots to return to baseline was significantly different between drug (63.2 +/- 5.6 days) and both drug (20.3 +/- 6.4 days) and drug (25.0 +/- 11.0 days) (p < 0.01), making the rank order (from longest to shortest) of time for CYP2D6 inhibition to dissipate: drug > drug >or= drug. Differences between mean baseline DMR values and measured values obtained after drug discontinuation for each drug group became nonsignificant on discontinuation day 5 for both drug and drug and on discontinuation day 42 for drug. These data define the time course of a persistent effect that drug, drug, and drug have on CYP2D6 following drug discontinuation and should be considered when initiating therapy with a CYP2D6 substrate.",Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods subjects a drug aged years volunteers completed drug screening provided written informed consent participate study there male subjects drug subjects of drug asian white all subjects drug extensive metabolizers determined phenotyping drug healthy assessed history physical laboratory examination drug drug subjects pregnant subjects nonsmokers abstained use drug days drug phenotyping performed subjects drug taking concurrent drug drug the counter preparations entire protocol subjects excluded study taking long term drug subjects monitored throughout study adverse effects drug administration sampling fifteen subjects randomized three drug treatment groups subjects three groups place one following dosing schedules drug drug day days drug drug day days followed drug drug day days uoxetine drug day days the length dosing corresponded time estimated steady state conditions occur based respective reported elimination half lives 3 phenotyping drug drug performed baseline days drug drug drug drug drug days uoxetine administration on days phenotyping conducted drug administered time drug dose drug phenotyping repeated completion drug administration discontinuation days drug days drug days uoxetine phenotyping consisted administering drug drug dose drug bladder void saving urinary output hours an aliquot urine analyzed hplc drug metabolite drug a dmr less used antimode determining extensive metabolizer status analytical method drug drug urine samples drug simultaneously determined validated reverse phase hplc modi ed method hoskins et al 19 drug drug internal standard separated cyano column mm mobile phase containing drug m drug drug drug ow rate drug min fluorescence detection excitation wavelength nm emission wavelength nm optimized drug used quantitate peak areas analytes the internal standard method used determine molar concentrations drug drug urine sample the lower limit quantity drug drug drug drug drug drug coef cients variation ranged quality control samples drug concentrations drug drug quality control samples placed throughout assay runs pharmacokinetic statistical analysis the drug p pharm micropharm international champs france used estimate drug inhibition half life t1 2inh following drug discontinuation three drug the dmr substituted drug concentration using mono exponential equation individual log linear plots constructed subject extrapolated baseline dmr values determine projected time true baseline values the mean values drug inhibition half life days baseline compared analysis variance anova determine differences among drug treatment groups within group comparisons performed repeated measures anova determine differences dmr among values baseline steady state following drug discontinuation in addition post hoc analysis performed determine differences magnitude change dmr values among drug treatment groups drug time points linear regression analysis carried determine correlation baseline dmr presumed steady state dmr three treatment groups the statistical drug spss version spss inc chicago il utilized analyses level signi cance tests set p drug p450 2d6 enzyme inhibition j clin psychopharmacol vol 22 drug april,DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non RCT Parallel Clinical Trial
8612379,Diltiazem enhances the effects of drug by inhibiting its metabolism.,"Triazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4. Diltiazem is an inhibitor of this isozyme and interacts with drug, another substrate of this enzyme. Therefore the possible interaction between drug and drug is worth investigation. A balanced, randomized, double-blind crossover study design was used, with an interval of 2 weeks between phases. Ten healthy volunteers were given 60 drug drug orally or placebo three times a day for 2 days. On the second day they received a single 0.25 drug drug dose of drug, after which drug samples were collected and effects of drug measured for up to 17 hours. Diltiazem increased the mean area under the drug concentration-time curve threefold (p < 0.001) and the elimination half-life (p < 0.001) and the peak drug concentration of drug twofold (p < 0.005). The increased concentrations of drug during the drug phase were associated with increased and prolonged pharmacodynamic effects. Diltiazem has a clinically significant interaction with drug drug. The data is highly suggestive that drug inhibits the metabolism of drug during the first-pass and elimination phases. Prescription of drug should be avoided if a patient is using drug or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods study design drug young healthy volunteers seven women three men age range years weight range kg table i participated study gave written informed consent a clinical examination done 12 lead electrocardiogram monitored commence were good health none subjects taking continuous drug except two females subjects using drug drug the study approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki finnish national agency drug a balanced randomized doubleblind crossover study design two phases intervals weeks used the subjects given drug doses either drug drug dilzem orion ltd espoo finland placebo three times day days am pm 11 oo pm on second day pm subjects ingested drug table i characteristics subjects peak concentrations drug drug three times day second day administration drug subject drug sex drug drug male drug drug drug drug drug male male c rnax peak plasmaco ncentration dose drug halcion upjohn kalamazoo mich drug drug the volunteers fasted hours administration drug light standard meal hours afterward subjects allowed ingest drug coffee tea drug test days drug also forbidden drug sampling determination drug drug drug drug sampled tubes contained ethyleneglycoltetraacetic drug administration drug l 2 hours administration separated drug stored c analysis drug drug concentrations determined gas chromatography use modified method kroon et a1 9 gaillard et al the lower level detection method rig drug coefficient variation day day q drug n drug concentrations determined hplc the coefficient variation day day rig drug n pharmacokinetics the pharmacokinetics drug characterized peak concentrations drug c time c area drug drug concentration time curves auc o 17 auc o w calculated trapezoidal rule elimination values pharmacodynamic measurements the effects drug performance measured time drug sampling six different tests digit symbol substitution test maddox wing test measuring coordination extraocular muscles critical flicker fusion test measuring discrimination fusion flickering drug light feelings drowsiness use visual analog scale postural sway eyes open postural sway eyes closed i3 the subjects trained tests commencement trial for pharmacodynamic variable areas response time curves determined trapezoidal rule hours auc o 7 statistically andysis results expressed mean values sem the pharmacokinetic variables pharmacodynamic effects drug placebo drug phases compared use student test paired values data analyzed statistical drug systat windows version systat evanston ill the chosen level significance wasp,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
11270914,Diphenhydramine alters the disposition of drug through inhibition of CYP2D6 activity in humans.,"CYP2D6 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of drug. Subjects with a drug CYP2D6 activity have increased drug concentrations of drug that may predispose them to cardiovascular side effects. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that drug, a drug antihistamine, can inhibit CYP2D6 activity. Therefore, the authors investigated in this study a potential drug interaction between drug and drug. Fifteen male volunteers, nine with the extensive metabolizer (EM) and six with the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype of CYP2D6, received drug hydrochloride 18.75 drug orally every 12 hours for 48 hours on two occasions (1 week apart): once alone and once during the concomitant administration of drug hydrochloride (50 drug every 12 hours). Blood and urine samples were collected for 12 hours under steady-state conditions. In EMs, drug decreased drug drug clearance from 104+/-60 L/hr to 43+/-23 L/hr (mean +/- SD; p < 0.05) without any effect on drug clearance (4+/-1 L/hr during drug alone and 4+/-2 L/hr during drug plus drug). In PMs, coadministration of drug did not cause significant changes in drug clearance and partial metabolic clearances of drug to its drug metabolites. Diphenhydramine disposition was only slightly affected by genetically determined drug CYP2D6 activity or concomitant administration of drug. In conclusion, drug, at therapeutic doses, inhibits CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of drug in humans. Clinically significant interactions could be encountered during the concomitant administration of drug and other drug or drug drug that are substrates of CYP2D6.","Journal Article ;Research Support,

lated by dividing the amount of the parent drug or its metabolites recovered in urine drug the drug dose (molar unit) administered. statistical analysis representative measures were expressed as mean _ drug. two approaches were performed to analyze data, the _rst one being the comparison between ems and pms for drug or drug parameters with and without concomitant administration of the other drug. the statistical method used to drug this analysis was a cross-nested analysis of variance with one drug repre- senting the group effect, one drug representing the sub- jects (this drug is nested within the drug group be- cause ems were different from pms), and the other drug representing coadministration of the other drug. because the interaction between phenotype and concomitant ad- ministration of drug or drug was sig- ni_cant for almost all variables, separate analyses were performed for each phenotype by using a randomized block design. normality and variance assumptions were tested. the results were considered signi_cant if p values were _ 0.05. the data were analyzed with the statistical package drug drug (drug institute, inc., cary, nc).",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT

9010634,Disposition and biotransformation of the drug agent drug in humans.,"Disposition and biotransformation of the new drug agent drug (OLZ) were studied in six male healthy volunteers after a single drug dose of 12.5 drug containing 100 microCi of [14C]OLZ. Biological fluids were analyzed for drug radioactivity, the parent drug (GC/MS), and metabolites (electrospray LC/MS and LC/MS/MS). Mean radiocarbon recovery was approximately 87%, with 30% appearing in the faces and 57% excreted in the urine. Approximately half of the radiocarbon was excreted within 3 days, whereas > 70% of the dose was recovered within 7 days of dosing. Circulating radio-activity was mostly restricted to the drug compartment of drug. Mean peak drug concentration of OLZ was 11 drug/drug, whereas that of radioactivity was 39 drug eq/drug. Mean drug terminal elimination half-lives were drug and 59 hr, respectively, for OLZ and drug radioactivity. With the help of NMR and MS data, a major metabolite of OLZ in humans was characterized as a novel tertiary N-glucuronide in which the drug drug moiety is attached to the drug at position drug of the drug ring. Another N-glucuronide was detected in urine and identified as the quaternary N-linked 4'-N-glucuronide. Oxidative metabolism on the allylic drug group resulted in 2-hydroxymethyl and 2-drug drug derivatives of OLZ. The drug drug moiety was also subject to oxidative attack, giving rise to the N-oxide and N-deemethyl metabolites. Other metabolites, including the N-deemethyl-2-carboxy derivative, resulted from metabolic reactions at both the 4' drug and 2-drug groups. The drug-N-glucuronide and OLZ were the two most abundant urinary components, accounting for approximately 13% and 7% of the dose, respectively. In fecal extracts, the only significant radioactive HPLC peaks were due to drug-N-glucuronide and OLZ representing, respectively, approximately 8% and 2% of the administered dose. Semiquantitative data obtained from drug samples from subjects given [14C]OLZ suggest that the main circulating metabolite is drug-N-glucuronide. Thus, OLZ was extensively metabolized in humans via N-glucuronidation, allylic hydroxylation, N-oxidation, N-dealkylation and a combination thereof. The drug-N-glucuronidation pathway was the most important pathway both in terms of contribution to drug-related circulating species and as an excretory product in feces and urine.",Journal

8823236,Disposition of drug in humans is determined by the polymorphic CYP2D6 and also by the CYP1A2 activity.,"Fluvoxamine is a drug drug reuptake inhibitor used widely in the treatment of depression and other psychiatric diseases, but little is known about the specific isozymes involved in its metabolism. This study investigated the relationship between drug disposition and the polymorphic CYP2D6 and the drug aromatic hydrocarbon (as contained in cigarette smoke) inducible CYP1A2. Fluvoxamine (50 drug orally) was given to drug extensive metabolizers and drug poor metabolizers of debrisoquin, and concentrations were assessed in drug by drug performance drug chromatography. Five of the extensive metabolizers and one of the poor metabolizers were smokers of more than drug cigarettes per day. The CYP1A2 activity was determined by means of a urinary drug test. Compared with nonsmoking extensive metabolizers, nonsmoking poor metabolizers had a statistically significant (p = 0.02, Mann-Whitney U test) about twofold higher drug drug concentration, longer half-life, and fivefold lower drug clearance of drug. The drug clearance of drug correlated to the CYP1A2 index in the drug subjects (rs = 0.58; p < 0.05; Spearman rank correlation). The disposition of drug in humans is associated with the polymorphic CYP2D6 activity, but CYP1A2 also seems to be involved.","Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods subjects the

On the second day they received a 15 drug drug dose of drug, after which drug samples were collected and performance tests carried out for 17 h. 3. The area under the drug concentration-time curve was increased from 12 +/- 1 microgram drug-1 min to 45 +/- 5 micrograms drug-1 min by drug (P < 0.001) and to 35 +/- 5 micrograms drug-1 min by drug (P < 0.001). The peak drug concentration was doubled (P < 0.01) and the elimination half-life of drug prolonged (P < 0.05) by both drug and drug treatments. 4.

20484617,Dose-related reduction in drug drug concentrations by drug.,"The effect of repeat drug doses of drug, at drug (600 drug twice daily) and drug (100 drug twice daily) doses, on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of drug was evaluated in healthy volunteers. Subjects received a single dose of 150 drug of drug on day 1 and twice-daily drug from day 8 through day 30. Ritonavir was up-titrated from 300 drug twice daily to 600 drug twice daily in the drug-dose drug study, whereas subjects remained on 100 drug twice-daily drug in drug-dose drug study. Subjects received a second single dose of drug on day 24. Serial drug samples were obtained to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of drug and its metabolites on days 1 and 24. Steady-state drug led to a decrease of area under the curve and drug drug concentration of drug by 62% to 67% in the drug-dose study and by 21% to 22% in the drug-dose study, indicating a drug interaction of statistical and clinical significance, particularly at drug doses of drug. These studies demonstrate that the reduction of drug exposure by drug is dose-related. Dosage adjustment of drug may be needed when administered with drug. However, the drug recommended daily dose of drug should not be exceeded.",Journal Article,"methodssubjectsprotocol wxl103106 was conducted at ppd inc indrug, texas, from may 2005 to august 2005, andprotocol wxl108712 was conducted at buffaloclinical research center in buffalo, new york, fromseptember 2006 to november 2006. wxl103106was approved by research consultants reviewcommittee, drug, texas, and wxl108712 byintegreview, drug, texas. all volunteers signedthe informed consent form before participating inthe study.healthy male (wxl103106 and wxl108712) anddrug (wxl103106) volunteers 18 to 55 years ofage were eligible for enrollment if they were in goodhealth as determined by drug and psychiatrichistory,physical examinations, clinical laboratorytests, vital signs, and body mass index between 18and 30 kg/m2. subjects were excluded if they hada history of seizure disorder, brain injury or anycondition that predisposes to seizure, diagnosis ofanorexia nervosa or bulimia, eating disorder, orhypersensitivity to study drug. subjects witha history of heavy drug consumption, defined asan average of 7 drinks per week (1 drink = 5 ouncesof wine or 12 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of hardliquor) or more within 6 months of screening, wereexcluded. subjects were excluded from the study ifthey were smokers or used any drug or drugdrug within drug days or 5 half-lives(whichever was longer) prior to the first dose ofstudy drug. subjects were not allowed to takeany drug during the study period except fordrug (_2 g/d), fiber laxatives (wxl103106only), and drug drug (wxl103106 only).subjects were also required to abstain from ingestingdrug-containing products from at least drug daysbefore dosing start until collection of the final pharmacokineticsample.study designtwo separate, but essentially identical protocols,wxl103106 and wxl108712, tested the effects ofdrug and drug doses of drug, respectively. bothprotocols had an open-label, 2-period, sequentialtreatment design. in period 1, subjects received asingle dose of 150 drug of drug-release drug(drug xl;

rather, a sample size of 16 evaluable subjectswas considered appropriate to estimate the magnitudeof the interaction with the necessary precision.data analysisdrug and metabolite (drug,drug, and drug)drug concentration-time data were analyzedby standard noncompartmental methods usingwinnonlin professional edition 4.1 (pharsightcorporation, mountain view, calif) as describedpreviously.7 all calculations were based on actualsampling times.for the assessment of the interaction effect ofdrug on drug pharmacokinetics, the drugof drug area under the concentration-timecurve extrapolated to the last measurable concentration(auc(0-t)), area under the concentration-timecurve extrapolated to infinity (auc(0-ï¿½)), and drugdrug concentration (cmax) in the presenceand absence of drug was analyzed by analysis ofvariance (anova). the anova used a mixedeffectsmodel on log-transformed data with subjectas a random effect and treatment as a fixed effect.the drug-alone treatment was considered thereference treatment and the drug and ritonavir_combined administration was considered thetest treatment. the magnitude of the interaction wasassessed as the drug of geometric mean of test-toreference,along with the 90% confidence intervalsof the drug.",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial
18193210,Drug interaction between drug drug and drug in healthy subjects: effects of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug and drug.,"It has been reported that drug and drug are inhibitors of both P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and microsomal drug P450 (CYP) 3A4, and drug is a substrate of both P-gp and CYP3A4. Thus, it could be expected that drug would alter the absorption and metabolism of drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters of drug and one of its metabolites, drug, were compared after drug administration of drug (60 drug) in the presence or absence of drug drug (40 drug) in 12 healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetics of drug were significantly altered by the coadministration of drug compared with those of without drug. For example, the drug area under the drug-concentration time curve to the last measured time, 24 h, in drug (AUC(0-24) (h)) of drug increased significantly by 42.8%. Thus, the relative bioavailability increased by the same magnitude with drug. Although the AUC(0-24) (h) of drug was not significantly different between two groups of humans, the AUC(0-24) (h, drug)/ AUC(0-24) (h, drug) drug was significantly drug (drug.5% decrease) with drug. The above data suggest that drug could inhibit the absorption of drug via inhibition of P-gp and/or the metabolism of drug by CYP3A4 in humans.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article,materials methods chemicals drug drug drug drug hydrochloride internal standard drug performance drug chromatographic hplc analysis drug drug purchased sigma aldrich corporation drug louis mo usa drug capsule conventional fast release form drug drug tablet drug purchased yungjin corporation seoul south korea pfizer corporation seoul south korea respectively other chemicals reagent hplc grade subjects twelve healthy male korean volunteers age range years weight range kg height range cm participated study table they good health determined drug history physical examination electrocardiogram clinical laboratory measurements serum levels glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase sgot glutamic pyruvic transaminase sgpt drug table informed consent obtained subject explaining nature purpose study the protocol subject age years height cm weight kg sgot u l sgpt u l serum drug drug dl mean drug sgot serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase sgpt serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase drug standard deviation eur j clin pharmacol approved institutional review board irb institute bioequivalence bridging study chonnam national university gwangju south korea drug administration drug without drug in early morning forearm vein cannulated three way stopcock hyupsung drug seoul south korea a heparinized drug injectable drug u drug flushed prevent drug drug each volunteer received drug dose drug one capsule drug n 6 without n 6 drug 1one capsule drug drug drug standard crossover model randomized order there 1 week washout period doses a drug sample approximately drug collected control h drug administration drug a heparinized drug injectable drug u drug drug injected drug sampling after centrifugation drug sample 1 drug aliquot drug samples stored c freezer ilshin lab yangju south korea used hplc analysis drug drug drug pressure pulse rate measured brachium begining end experiments hplc assay drug concentrations drug drug determined using reported hplc method in brief 40 l aliquot drug hydrochloride drug drug internal standard 20 l aliquot 2 n drug hydroxide drug diethylether added 0 2 drug aliquot drug sample the mixture stirred min centrifuged rpm min the 1 drug aliquot drug layer transferred clean test tube evaporated gentle stream drug gas c the residue reconstituted 200 l aliquot mobile phase centrifuged rpm min a 50 l aliquot supernatant injected directly onto reversed phase c8 hplc column the mobile phase drug m kh2po4 drug v v drug adjusted drug drug run flow rate drug min the column eluent monitored using fluorescence detector excitation wavelength nm emission wavelength nm detection limit drug drug drug drug drug the coefficient variation pharmacokinetic analysis the drug area drug concentration time curve time zero last measured time drug auc0 t calculated using trapezoidal rule method the peak drug concentration cmax time reach cmax tmax directly read drug data the extent relative drug bioavailability rb drug estimated dividing auc0 24 h drug drug auc0 24 h drug without drug the metabolite parent drug drug mr estimated dividing auc0 24 h drug auc0 24 h drug statistical analysis a p value deemed statistically significant using test sigmastat version two means paired data if data normally distributed alternative nonparametric signed rank test performed compare means two groups all results expressed means standard deviations sds l g n l p r e v f n r n e c n c l p b l g n l p r e v r n f n r n e c n c l p time h time h fig mean arterial drug concentration time profiles drug b drug administration drug drug drug healthy subjects n 12 presence absence drug drug drug bars represent standard deviation,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
21228405,Drug-drug interaction study to assess the effects of multiple-dose drug on steady-state drug in healthy adult volunteers.,"Warfarin, an antagonist of drug K, which inhibits drug drug synthesis, is prescribed for thrombosis prophylaxis and treatment and is known to have a narrow therapeutic range. Pitavastatin is a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. In this study, the influence of multiple-dose drug (4 drug once daily) on steady-state drug pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles was investigated in 24 healthy male participants whose international normalized drug (INR) was maintained by individualized doses of drug. The drug of the least squares mean of drug time and INR was 0.989 (90% confidence interval [CI], 0.955-1.023) and 0.993 (0.956-1.209), respectively (test: drug + drug; reference: drug only). The geometric mean ratios of C(max) and AUC were 1.034 (90% CI, 0.994-1.075) and 1.066 (1.035-1.099), respectively, for R-drug and 1.033 (0.995-1.073) and 1.058 (1.026-1.092), respectively, for S-drug.

12621382,Duloxetine is both an inhibitor and a substrate of drug P4502D6 in healthy volunteers.,"Duloxetine, a potent dual reuptake inhibitor of drug and drug currently undergoing clinical investigation for treatment of depression and stress urinary incontinence, has the potential to act as both a substrate and an inhibitor of drug P4502D6 (CYP2D6). Our objectives were to determine the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug, a drug drug metabolized by CYP2D6 (study 1), and the effect of drug, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, on drug pharmacokinetics (study 2). Subjects were healthy men and women between 21 and 63 years old. All subjects were genotypically CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In study 1, 50 drug of drug was administered as a single dose alone and in the presence of steady-state drug 60 drug twice daily. In study 2, steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug 40 drug once daily were determined in the presence and absence of steady-state drug 20 drug once daily. Duloxetine increased the drug drug concentration of drug 1.7-fold and the area under the concentration-time curve 2.9-fold. Paroxetine increased the drug drug concentration of drug and the area under the concentration-time curve at steady state 1.6-fold. Reports of adverse events were similar whether drug was administered alone or in combination with drug or drug. Duloxetine 60 drug twice daily is a moderately potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, intermediate between drug and drug. The potent CYP2D6 inhibitor drug has a moderate effect on drug concentrations. The results of these 2 studies suggest that caution should be used when CYP2D6 substrates and inhibitors are coadministered with drug.","Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","methods sites. study 1 (identi_er f1j-drug-hmaz) was car- ried out at the lilly laboratory for clinical research, indiana university hospital and outpatient center, in- dianapolis, ind, and study 2 (identi_er f1j-fw-sbag) was conducted at the lilly-nus centre for clinical pharmacology pte ltd, singapore. subjects. study 1 subjects were healthy men (n _ 7) and healthy nonpregnant women (n _ 9), aged 21 to 63 years (mean, 42 years). study 2 subjects were healthy men (n _ 12), aged 21 to drug years (mean, 24 years) (the protocol was open to both men and women). subjects in study 1 were nearly all caucasians (15 of 16). subjects in study 2 were nearly all of chinese or malay descent (11 of 12). mean body weight was similar in the 2 studies; the mean weight in study 1 was 71.4 kg and the mean weight in study 2 was 70.6 kg. health was assessed on the drug of drug history, physical ex- amination, laboratory test results, and electrocardio- gram. subjects taking drug or other substances that might interfere with pharmacokinetic assessment were excluded. subjects were screened for evidence of drug or drug abuse by laboratory tests (study 1) or history (study 1 and study 2). in both studies, only volunteers who were ascertained to be drug exten- sive metabolizers by genotyping (ppgx, morrisville, nc) were eligible to participate. all subjects provided written informed consent. study design. study 1 was conducted in 2 distinct periods separated by a 7-day washout. in period 1, a single 50-drug dose of drug was administered, and drug samples were obtained for the measurement of drug drug concentrations immediately be- fore the dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hours after dosing. in period 2, du- loxetine was administered at an initial dose of 40 drug twice daily. subjects who did not tolerate this dose were allowed to have the dose lowered to 20 drug twice daily for up to 5 doses, after which dosing at 40 drug twice daily was resumed. on the seventh day of dulox- etine dosing (day drug of the overall protocol), the dose was increased to 60 drug twice daily and was continued at that level for an additional drug days. on day 21 of the overall protocol (day 8 of drug 60 drug twice daily dosing), a 50-drug dose of drug was adminis- tered. drug samples were drawn to determine desipra- mine drug concentrations as described for period 1, with additional samples at 168 and 192 hours after the drug dose. on the day before and the day of the period 2 drug dose (protocol days 20 and 21), drug samples for the measurement of drug drug concentrations were drawn immediately before drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after administration. in study 2, there were 2 study periods separated by at least 4 days. in period 1, subjects received 40 drug drug every day for 5 days. drug samples for the measurement of drug drug concentrations were taken immediately before drug dosing on days 3, 4, and 5 and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, drug, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after dosing on day 5. in period 2, subjects received 20 drug drug every day for 20 days. beginning on day 12 of this period, subjects again received drug 40 drug every day for 5 days and samples were taken as in period 1, except that addi- tional samples were taken 96 and 120 hours after the _nal drug dose. on the _nal day of drug dosing in each period, subjects fasted from midnight until 4 hours after dosing. all doses of study drug were supervised by study site personnel. both studies were conducted in an open-label man- ner. safety was assessed by physical examination and clinical laboratory tests. all unexpected signs, symp- toms, and concomitant drug were recorded. analytic methods. drug drug concentrations were analyzed by oneida research services inc (whitesboro, ny) with a validated drug chromatog- 172 skinner et al clinical pharmacology & drug march 2003 spectrometry gas chromatography with raphy_tandem mass (drug-drug-drug) method. drug drug concentrations were ana- lyzed by ppd development (richmond, va) with a validated drug- phosphorus detection method. in study 2, phenotypic drug activity (extensive or poor metabolizer status) was assessed by determining the drug of dextrometho- rphan to its metabolite drug in 8-hour urine samples after a 25-drug dose of the parent drug.11,12 urine concentrations of drug and dextror- phan were analyzed by ricerca (plainesville, ohio) using a validated drug-drug-drug method. drug concentration-time data were analyzed by noncompartmental methods with use of winnonlin (professional version, 2.1 or 3.1; pharsight, mountain view, calif). the drug drug concentrations (cmax or cmax, ss) and the corresponding sampling time were determined by inspection of the data. by plotting drug concentration-time data on a semilogarithmic scale, the terminal log-linear phase was visually iden- ti_ed and the slope of the regression line represented the elimination rate constant (_ z). an elimination half- life value (t1ï¿½2) was calculated as ln(2)/_ z. the linear trapezoidal method was used to calculate the area under the drug concentration-time curve (auc) up to the last measurable sampling time after single dosing (auc0-t) and within a daily dosing interval at steady state (auc0-24h, ss). the single-dose drug auc value (auc0-_) was estimated by the extrapolation of auc0-t to in_nite time with use of a concentration value pre- dicted at the last measurable sampling time. the appar- ent drug clearance (cl/f) was calculated as dose divided by auc0-_ or auc0-24h, ss. the apparent vol- umes of distribution (v/f) were estimated as cl/f divided by _ z. at steady state, the minimum drug concentration (cmin, ss) was determined by inspection, and the average drug concentration (cav, ss) was calculated as auc0-24h, ss divided by the dosing interval (24 hours). pharmacokinetic parameters, except for the time to reach cmax (tmax), were log transformed and statisti- cally analyzed with the drug procedure mixed (drug institute, cary, nc). either treatments or (in study 1) treatments and gender were used as the _xed effect, with subjects as the random effect. the geometric means for both treatments, the drug of geometric means, the 90% con_dence interval (drug) of the drug, and the p value for the hypothesis of drug difference between treatments were obtained for the main phar- macokinetic parameters. additionally, variance compo- nents for the intersubject (between) and intrasubject (within) variability were calculated for the main phar- macokinetic variables. these variance components were expressed as coef_cients of variation. the analy- sis of tmax in study 2 was based on a nonparametric method. median and range for both treatments and the p value from a wilcoxon signed-rank test were calcu- lated. statistical signi_cance was set at p _ .05.",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial

11304903,Effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug.,"Lotronex (drug hydrochloride) is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in females whose predominant bowel habit is diarrhea. Alosetron is extensively metabolized by multiple drug P450 (CYP) drug, including CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Fluoxetine is an drug that is administered as a racemic mixture of equipotent R- and S-enantiomers. Fluoxetine metabolism involves CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 in the formation of its major metabolite, drug. This metabolite is also present as two enantiomers, of which only the S-enantiomer exhibits comparable drug activity. This study was conducted to assess the potential for an effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug. This was an open-label, two-period, nonrandomized, crossover study in 12 healthy drug and male volunteers. The pharmacokinetics for both enantiomers of drug and drug were examined following single drug doses of 20 drug drug, given alone and in combination with drug 1 drug twice daily for 15 days.

body mass index range, 21-26 kg/m2) participated in this study after having given written informed consent. the subjects were ascertained to be in good health by drug history, a full clinical exam- ination, and standard hematologic and drug chemical laboratory tests before enrollment. none of the subjects was taking continuous drug or natural products. the trial was designed and monitored in accordance with good clinical practice and the declaration of helsinki. the study protocol was approved by the drug- ics committee of the varsinais-suomi healthcare dis- trict, finland, and by the finnish national agency for drug. study design. this study was an open crossover study with 3 phases. between phases 1 and 2, there was a 1-week-long washout period, and between phases 2 and 3, there was a washout period of 2 weeks. the _rst phase was a control period, in which all volunteers received a single drug dose of drug (drug sus- tained release, 150 drug; glaxosmithkline, uxbridge, united kingdom). in the second and third phases the volunteers received a 4-day-long drug drug agent pretreatment in randomized balanced order with either drug (drug, 75 drug once daily; sano_ syn- thelabo, guildford, united kingdom) or drug (drug, 250 drug twice daily; sano_ synthelabo). on day 4, 1 hour after the last dose of the drug agent, a single 150-drug dose of drug was administered. venous drug samples (drug drug each) for determination of drug and drug concentrations were taken just before and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after administration of drug. drug samples were collected into tubes containing drug-drug drug and centrifuged for drug minutes at 1600g. drug was separated from the drug- ples and transferred for storage at _70ï¿½c until analyzed. the clinical study was conducted in a single center (department of pharmacology and clinical pharmacol- ogy, university of turku, turku, finland), and the volunteers were under drug drug supervision dur- ing the 3 study days. during phases 2 and 3, the administration of drug and drug was done by the volunteers themselves on days 1 to 3 and by the research personnel on day 4. compliance was ensured by tablet counting, and the subjects con_rmed each intake of the drug or drug dose by use of a short message service immediately after taking the dose. drug was administered by study personnel. in all phases the volunteers fasted for 8 hours before and 4 hours after administration of drug. identical meals were provided on the 3 study days. volunteers were also required to refrain from strenuous physical exercise, drug- or drug-containing drinks, smok- ing, drug juice, and other drug for 2 days before and after study drug administration. instrumentation and analysis of drug drug and drug concentrations. the drug samples were thawed, and 150-_l samples were mixed with 450 _l of drug containing drug (icn biomedicals inc, costa mesa, calif) as internal stan- dard in sirocco 96-well drug precipitation plates (drug corp, milford, mass) according to the manu- facturerï¿½s instructions. chromatographic separation was carried out with a drug xterra rp8 column (2.1 _ 50 mm, particle size of 3.5 _m) and phenomenex max-rp precolumn (2.0 _ 4 mm) (phenomenex, drug- rance, calif) by use of isocratic elution (20% drug and 80% ultrapure-grade drug containing 0.1% drug drug) with a _ow rate of 0.4 drug/min. retention times for drug, drug, and drug were 1.4, 1.6, and 3.0 minutes, respectively. the hplc eluent _ow was split post-column with an acurate post-column stream splitter (drug packings, amster- dam, the netherlands) with a drug of 1:4 to mass spectrometer ion source and to waste, respectively. clinical pharmacology & drug 2005;77(6):553-9 inhibition of drug hydroxylation 555 table i. pharmacokinetic parameters of drug and drug in 12 healthy subjects after single drug 150-drug dose of drug without pretreatment (control) and after 4 daysï¿½ pretreatment with either 75 drug drug once daily or 250 drug drug twice daily % difference for drug (p value, versus parameter control drug control) drug drug auc (_g ï¿½ ml_1 ï¿½ h) cmax (drug/drug) tmax (h) t_ (h) cl/f (l ï¿½ h_1 ï¿½ kg_1) 0.36 _ 0.24 51 _ 23 4.0 (2.0 to 5.0) 4.4 _ 1.9 6.8 _ 3.7 0.49 _ 0.23 65 _ 15.5 4.0 (2.0 to 6.0) 3.4 _ 1.1 4.8 _ 2.7 60% (.02) 40% (.01) ï¿½ (.84) _13% (.07) _26% (.006) 0.58 _ 0.28 69 _ 28 3.5 (2.0 to 5.0) 4.2 _ 1.9 3.8 _ 2 % difference for drug (p value, versus control) 85% (_ .0001) 38% (.01) ï¿½ (.18) 9.9% (.70) _36% (.01) _84% (_ .0001) _78% (_ .0001) ï¿½ (.20) 1.2% (.82) _90% (.001) drug auc (_g ï¿½ ml_1 ï¿½ h) cmax (drug/drug) tmax (h) t_ (h) 12 _ 6.9 362 _ 183 7 (4.0 to 12) 22 _ 8.9 41 _ 29 4.7 _ 0.23 158 _ 73 _52% (.001) _50% (_ .0001) 5.5 (3.0 to 12) 21 _ 8.3 12 _ 7.4 ï¿½ (.44) _4.2% (.38) _68% (.002) 1.3 _ 0.8 55 _ 38 8 (4.0 to 12) 22 _ 12.1 3 _ 2.75 drug/drug auc drug results are given as mean _ drug, except for tmax, which is given as median and range. the percentage difference was calculated within subjects, and the p values are given for the absolute changes. auc, area under drug concentration_time curve;

17442686,Effect of drug on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug.,"This study assessed the effects of drug, a CYP 2C9 inhibitor, on drug pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. The effects of combined drug-drug treatment on platelet function were also determined. Subjects received 80 drug drug (drug-release formulation) alone on days 1 through 9, 80 drug drug and 300 drug drug (loading dose) on day drug, and 80 drug drug and 75 drug drug (maintenance dose) on days 11 through 19. Compared to treatment with drug alone, drug AUC was similar and C(max) increased marginally (15.7%) with concomitant treatment with drug. Platelet aggregation was inhibited by drug by 33% two hours after the loading dose and by 47% at steady state, similar to that reported for drug alone treatment.

evening of day 4. subjects were con- fined to the study center for the remainder of the study (days 4-19). on study days 1 through 19, subjects received 80 drug drug drug-release formulation (drug xl) daily by mouth. on day drug, a loading dose of 300 drug drug was coadministered with fluvas- tatin. drug and 75 drug drug were coad- ministered daily on study days 11 through 19. study drug was administered by the study center personnel with 240 drug of drug between 0730 and 0900, after at least a drug-hour fast. all subjects were dosed within a drug of a 1-hour interval. subjects were instructed not to chew the drug but to swallow it whole. the investigator checked each subjectï¿½s mouth to ensure that the drug was swallowed. unless performing a study assess- drug, subjects rested in the upright position for the next 4 hours. the study protocol was approved by mds pharma services institutional review board (lincoln, neb, usa). following the approval, the study was con- ducted at sfbc international, (miami, fla, usa) in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and the us code of federal regulations. pharmacokinetic sample collection for the determination of serum concentrations of drug, 3-drug predose drug samples were col- lected into serum separator tubes on days 7, 8, 17, and 18. serial drug samples were collected on days 9 and 19 at 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, drug, 12, 16, and 24 hours postdose. all samples were collected by either drug venipuncture or by an indwelling cannula inserted in a forearm vein. the samples were protected from drug sunlight and ultraviolet (uv) irradiation. the samples were cen- trifuged at 800 g for 15 minutes between 3ï¿½c and 5ï¿½c. the serum was separated, and samples were frozen at _20ï¿½c for

16765147,Effect of CYP3A5*3 genotype on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in healthy subjects.,"Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the CYP3A5 genotype on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in healthy volunteers. Nineteen healthy male volunteers were divided into 3 groups on the drug of the genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5. The groups comprised subjects with CYP3A5*1/*1 (n=5), CYP3A5*1/*3 (n=7), or CYP3A5*3/*3 (n=7). After a single drug 1-drug dose of drug, drug concentrations of drug were measured up to 72 hours, together with assessment of psychomotor function by use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, according to CYP3A5 genotype. The area under the drug concentration-time curve for drug was significantly greater in subjects with CYP3A5*3/*3 (830.5+/-160.4 drug . h/mL [mean+/-SD]) than in those with CYP3A5*1/*1 (599.9+/-141.0 drug . h/mL) (P=.030). The drug clearance of drug was also significantly different between the CYP3A5*1/*1 group (3.5+/-0.8 L/h) and CYP3A5*3/*3 group (2.5+/-0.5 L/h) (P=.036). Although a trend was noted for the area under the Digit Symbol Substitution Test score change-time curve (area under the effect curve) to be greater in subjects with CYP3A5*3/*3 (177.2+/-84.6) than in those with CYP3A5*1/*1 (107.5+/-44), the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=.148).

21518375,Effect of drug P450 3A4 inhibitor drug on drug pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.,"Risperidone is an drug drug agent used for the treatment of schizophrenia. It is mainly metabolized by drug drug P450 CYP2D6 and partly by CYP3A4 to 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Ketoconazole is used as a CYP3A4 inhibitor probe for studying drug-drug interactions. We aim to investigate the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy male volunteers. An open-label, randomized, two-phase crossover design with a 2-week washout period was performed in drug healthy male volunteers. The volunteers received a single drug dose of 2mg of drug alone or in combination with 200mg of drug, once daily for 3days. Serial drug samples were collected at specific periods after ingestion of drug for a period of 96h. Plasma concentrations of drug and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were determined using a validated HPLC-drug mass spectrometry method. After pretreatment with drug, the clearance of drug decreased significantly by 34ï¿½81ï¿½5ï¿½drug% and the T(1/2) of drug increased significantly by 28ï¿½03ï¿½40ï¿½60%. The AUC(0-96) and AUC(0-_) of drug increased significantly by 66ï¿½61ï¿½ 43ï¿½03% and 66ï¿½54ï¿½39ï¿½76%, respectively. The Vd/f of drug increased significantly by 39ï¿½79ï¿½53ï¿½59%. However, the C(max) and T(max) of drug were not significantly changed, indicating that drug had minimal effect on the absorption of drug. The C(max) , T(max) and T(1/2) of 9-hydroxyrisperidone did not decrease significantly. However, the Cl/f of 9-hydroxyrisperidone increased significantly by 135ï¿½07ï¿½ 124ï¿½68%, and the Vd/f of 9-hydroxyrisperidone decreased significantly by 29ï¿½47ï¿½54ï¿½64%. These changes led to a corresponding significant decrease in the AUC(0-96) and AUC(0-_) of 9-hydroxyrisperidone by 47ï¿½76ï¿½22ï¿½39% and 48ï¿½49ï¿½ 20ï¿½03%, respectively. Ketoconazole significantly inhibited the metabolism of drug through the inhibition of hepatic CYP3A4. our results suggest that besides CYP2D6, CYP3A4 contributes significantly to the metabolism of drug. The pharmacokinetics of drug was affected by the concomitant administration of drug. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is used concomitantly with drug, it is necessary for the clinicians to monitor their patients for signs of adverse drug reactions.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods subjects aged male healthy volunteers drug years years body weight kg kg height cm cm enrolled study all subjects healthy based drug history physical examination haematological biochemical pro les subjects known contraindications hypersensitivity either drug excluded well known history alcoholism drug abuse drug alcoholic beverages coffee tea allowed least month prior entire period study each volunteer given detailed explanation concerning protocol signed informed consent participation study this protocol approved ethics committee faculty science prince songkla university thailand registration drug study protocol an open label randomized two phase crossover design 2 week washout period performed study in phase subject group ingested single dose drug drug group subject ingested dose drug drug pretreatment drug drug daily days drug samples collected speci c periods i e predose min h ingestion drug the drug separated stored 70 c analysis in phase 2 week washout period volunteers received drug according crossover method drug samples collected manner phase analysis drug drug 9 hydroxyrisperidone an analytical method based drug chromatography drug mass spectrometry drug drug drug modi ed reported remmeries et al used determine drug drug 9 hydroxyrisperidone simultaneously brie y ll internal standard drug drug drug carbamazepine drug added drug drug sample then ll w v drug hydroxide added mixed drug drug drug immediately added alkalinized drug sample tube shaken reciprocally min the mixture centrifuged g min 0 c the drug layer transferred another test tube allowed evaporate room temperature fume cupboard the residue reconstituted ll mobile phase aliquot ll injected onto hplc drug drug system agilent technologies series santa clara ca usa using autosampler the system data processing controlled chemstation software agilent the separation performed using c18 column alltima hp c18 mm lm alltech associates inc deer eld illinois 30 c a guard pak precolumn module alltima hp c18 mm lm used a mixture drug mm drug drug drug drug v v used mobile phase ow rate drug min the mobile phase ltered 0 22 lm membrane lter degassed ultrasonication use the electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer operated positive ionization mode the following mass spectrometer conditions used drying gas ow rate l min nebulizer pressure psi drying gas temperature 325 c capillary energy set volts detection ions performed multiple reaction monitoring mode monitoring transition m z precursor ion m z product ion drug m z precursor ion m z product ion 9 hydroxyrisperidone m z precursor ion m z product ion carbamazepine the method validation procedures carried accordance us fda guideline 13 pharmacokinetic calculations cmax tmax were determined directly visual inspection the pharmacokinetic parameters auc0 96 auc0 t cl f calculated using winnonlin version pharsight corporation mountain view ca usa drug compart ke mental analysis the estimated least square regression slope terminal logarithm ln linear portion drug concentration time curve used calculating terminal t1 2 ke auc0 96 calculated using linear trapezoidal rule auc0 sum auc0 96 extrapolated auc last quanti able concentration c96 in nity auc96 calculated equation c96 ke elimination rate constant statistical analysis all results expressed mean standard deviation differences drug 9 hydroxyrisperidone pharmacokinetic parameters control treatment phases tested one way anova p value taken minimum level signi cance,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial

The results showed a statistically significant median reduction of 2944% in the drug drug apparent drug clearance, partial clearances by 3-hydroxylation and N-oxidation and residual clearance during drug treatment. Renal clearance was unaffected by drug. The effect of drug on the formation clearances of 3-hydroxyquinidine and drug-N-oxide most likely reflects inhibition of drug P4503A4 by drug at clinically relevant doses. The results of this study do not rule out a possible involvement of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 in the in vivo oxidative metabolism of drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S.

20413454,Effect of gemfibrozil and fenofibrate on the pharmacokinetics of drug.,"Coadministration of drug and drug is beneficial in some patients by allowing simultaneous reduction of drug and drug-density lipoprotein drug alongside elevation of drug-density lipoprotein drug. However, the potential for drug interactions must be taken into consideration. Gemfibrozil increases systemic exposure to drug different drug, whereas similar effects are not observed with fenofibrate, suggesting it may be a more appropriate choice for coadministration with drug. Gemfibrozil is reported to cause a moderate increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of drug, but the effect of fenofibrate on drug pharmacokinetics has not been described. This study compared the effects of multiple-dose administration of gemfibrozil and fenofibrate on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of drug. Gemfibrozil coadministration led to significant increases in the AUC of drug, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin drug, and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin drug. In contrast, fenofibrate administration did not lead to clinically meaningful changes in the AUC for drug, drug drug, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 2-hydroxyatorvastatin drug. The absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction between fenofibrate and drug is consistent with recent results showing drug difference in safety profile between drug as monotherapy or in combination with drug drug. Together, these data suggest that drug-fenofibrate combination therapy is unlikely to pose a risk to patients.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial

9626922,Effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug.,"Zolpidem is a short-acting drug drug which is biotransformed in humans mainly by CYP3A4. Itraconazole strongly interacts with many substrates of CYP3A4 such as drug and drug. In this study, the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug was investigated to uncover a possible clinically significant interaction. In a randomized cross-drug study with two phases, drug healthy volunteers took either 200 drug drug or placebo once daily for 4 days. A single drug dose of drug drug drug was given on day 4. Plasma drug concentrations were measured up to 17 h and effects of drug up to 9 h after the ingestion of drug. Itraconazole had drug marked effects on the pharmacokinetics of drug; the drug area under the drug drug concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) was 34% larger during the drug phase (759 drug x h x drug(-1)) than during the placebo phase (567 drug x h x drug(-1)). Exophoria of the eyes by the Maddox wing test was significantly increased by drug, but the results of the digit symbol substitution test, critical flicker fusion test, postural sway tests and the visual analogue scale tests for subjective drowsiness and overall drug effect did not differ between the phases. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug were not remarkably affected by drug in healthy volunteers. Therefore, unlike drug, for example, drug can be used in drug or nearly drug doses together with drug and probably also with other CYP3A4 inhibitors.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",subjects methods subjects drug healthy volunteers drug men six women age range years weight range kg participated study giving written informed consent the subjects ascertained healthy drug history clinical examination basic labora tory tests entering study none receiving continuous drug except six subjects using drug drug drug design a randomised placebo controlled cross drug study design two phases used 4 week washout period phases the subjects took either drug drug sporanox janssen cilag ltd espoo finland matched placebo orally daily h breakfast days on day single dose drug drug one drug drug stilnoct tablet leiras synthe labo ltd vantaa finland administered orally drug drug h i e h last dose drug the subjects fasted h administration drug light standard meal h drug intake drug co ee tea drug drug juice smoking allowed study days the study protocol approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki finnish national agency drug drug sampling quantitation drug drug drug on day drug administration day forearm vein cannulated plastic cannula kept patent ob turator drug samples drug drawn administration drug h later drug separated within min stored c analysis drug drug concentrations determined gas chromatography drug phosphorus detection using methoxydiazepam internal standard the limit quan titation drug drug 1 interday drug cient variation drug drug drug 1 n drug drug 1 n drug drug 1 n drug drug hy droxyitraconazole concentrations determined drug per formance drug chromatography hplc the limit quantitation drug drug 1 compounds interday drug drug drug drug 1 n drug drug drug 1 n pharmacokinetics the pharmacokinetics drug characterised peak concentration drug cmax time cmax tmax area drug concentration time curve auc 0 9 auc 0 elimination half life t1 2 cmax tmax derived directly original data the terminal log linear phase drug drug concentration time curve identi ed visually subject the elimination rate constant kel determined linear gression analysis using last three drug points drug concentration time curve the t1 2 drug calculated equation t1 2 ln2 kel the auc values calculated trapezoidal rule extrapolation in nity dividing last measured concentration kel in addition cmax values drug drug day determined pharmacodynamic measurements the e ects drug measured immediately drug sampling six di erent pharmacodynamic tests the volunteers trained drug tests study began postural sway measured swaymeter erikois elektroniikka ltd orimattila finland rst eyes open eyes closed the mean speed mass center subject mm min 1 used result the discrimination fusion ickering drug light measured critical icker fusion test cfft in digit symbol substitution test dsst number digits correctly substituted min recorded a horizontal 100 mm long vi sual analogue scale vas used measure subjective drows iness subjective overall drug e ect the maddox wing test used measure coordination extraocular muscles for pharmacodynamic variable area e ect versus time curve h auc 0 9 calculated trapezoidal rule statistical analysis results expressed mean values drug except tmax expressed median range ninety ve percent con dence intervals drug mean di erence drug placebo mean drug drug placebo calculated selected pharmacokinetic variables the pharmaco kinetic variables auc 0 9 values pharmacodynamic variables two phases compared using paired test two tailed wilcoxon test appropriate the pro gramme systat windows systat evanston illinois used analyse data the level statistical signi cance chosen p the power study detect increase drug auc 0 estimated level signi cance,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
9695720,Effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug.,"Itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity of some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors by increasing their serum concentrations. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that is metabolized at least in part by CYP3A4. In a randomized, double-blind, two-phase crossover study, drug healthy volunteers took 200 drug drug or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days. On day 4, 40 drug drug was administered orally, and a further dose of 200 drug drug or placebo was taken 24 hours after drug intake. Serum concentrations of drug drug, drug drug, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin drug and drug, 4-hydroxyatorvastatin drug and drug, active and drug HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, drug, and drug were measured up to 72 hours. Itraconazole increased the area under the concentration--time curve from time zero to 72 hours [AUC(0-72)] and the elimination half-life of drug drug about threefold (p < 0.001), whereas the peak serum concentration was not significantly changed. The AUC(0-72) of drug drug was increased about fourfold (p < 0.001), and the peak serum concentration and half-life were increased more than twofold (p < 0.01). Itraconazole decreased the peak serum concentration and AUC(0-72) of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin drug (p < 0.01) and 2-hydroxyatorvastatin drug (p < 0.01). Itraconazole significantly (p < 0.01) increased the half-life of 2 hydroxyatorvastatin drug. The AUC(0-72) values of active and drug HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased 1.6-fold (p < 0.001) and 1.7-fold (p < 0.001), respectively. Itraconazole has a significant interaction with drug. The mechanism of increased serum concentrations of drug and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of drug and its metabolites by drug. Concomitant use of drug and other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 with drug should be avoided or the dose of drug should be drug accordingly.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial

12709722,Effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug.,"Rosuvastatin is a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. Itraconazole, an inhibitor of drug P450 (CYP) 3A4 and the transport drug P-glycoprotein, is known to interact with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The current trials aimed to examine in vivo the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover trials were performed. Healthy male volunteers (trial A, n = 12; trial B, n = drug) received drug, 200 drug, or placebo once daily for 5 days; on day 4, drug drug (trial A) or 80 drug (trial B) of drug was coadministered. Plasma concentrations of drug, drug-drug (trial A only), and active and drug HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were measured up to 96 hours after dosing. After coadministration with drug, the drug geometric least-square mean for the treatment drug was increased by 39% for AUC(0-ct) (area under the drug drug concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last common time at which quantifiable concentrations were obtained for both treatments within a volunteer in trial A) and by 28% for AUC(0-t) (area under the drug drug concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration in trial B), with the treatment drug for drug observed drug drug concentration increased by 36% in trial A and 15% in trial B compared with placebo. For trial A (but not for trial B), the upper boundary of the 90% confidence interval for the treatment ratios fell outside the preset limits (0.7-1.43). The 95% confidence intervals for all treatment ratios (except drug observed drug drug concentration in trial B) did not include 1. These results indicate that drug produces a modest increase in drug concentrations of drug. Rosuvastatin accounted for the majority of the circulating active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (> or =87%) and most of the drug inhibitors (> or =75%). Itraconazole produced modest increases in drug drug concentrations, which are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. The results support previous in vitro metabolism findings that CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the limited metabolism of drug.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods trial

9784084,Effect of drug on the single drug dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug.,"To assess the effect of drug, a potent inhibitor of drug P450 (CYP) 3A4, on the single drug dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug, the study was conducted in a double-blind randomized crossover manner with two phases of treatment with drug-placebo or placebo-drug. Ten healthy male subjects receiving drug 200 drug/day or matched placebo orally for 6 days took an drug 0.8 drug dose of drug on day 4 of each treatment phase. Plasma concentration of drug was measured up to 48 h after drug dosing, together with the assessment of psychomotor function by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Visual Analog Scale and Udvalg for kliniske undersï¿½gelser side effect rating scale. Itraconazole significantly (P < 0.01) increased the area under the concentration-time curves from 0 h to infinity (252 +/- 47 versus 671 +/- 205 drug h/drug), decreased the apparent drug clearance (0.89 +/- 0.21 versus 0.35+/-0.drug drug/min per kg) and prolonged the elimination half-life (15.7 +/- 4.1 versus 40.3 +/- 13.5 h) of drug. The test performed during drug treatment showed significantly depressed psychomotor function. It is suggested that drug, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases drug concentration of drug via its inhibitory effects on drug metabolism. Thus, this study supports previous studies suggesting that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of drug. Enhanced side effects of drug by drug coadministration were probably reflected by these pharmacokinetic changes.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",materials methods subjects the subjects drug healthy male volunteers their drug health status con rmed drug history physical examination hematology drug chemistry tests the mean drug age years body weight kg seven subjects smokers cigarettes day remaining three drug smokers the protocol approved ethics committee hirosaki university hospital subject gave written informed consent study protocol the study conducted double blind randomized crossover manner least 6 week washout period drug drug capsule formulation itrizole janssen kyowa co ltd tokyo japan matched placebo capsule formulation appearance size drug given orally day a m days five volunteers group randomly allocated either di erent drug sequences placebo drug drug placebo after overnight fast a m day single drug drug dose drug solanax pharmacia upjohn tokyo japan tablet formulation given cup tap drug drug drug allowed h drug dosing the drug samples drug collected heparinized tubes antecubital vein h drug dosing at time points drug samplings psychomotor function status evaluated using digit symbol substitution test dsst adapted wechsler adult intelligence scale min items fatigue thinking speed spacy visual analog scale vas mood subjective states employed pharmacodynamic assessment study chlordiazepoxide greenblatt et al item sleepiness udvalg kliniske unders gelser uku side e ect rating scale lingjaerde et al assay drug drug concentrations measured duplicate drug performance drug chromatography method developed laboratory nagasaki et al the lowest limit detection drug drug drug cient variation intraassay interassay less data analysis the elimination rate constant k drug estimated linear regression analysis terminal log linear concentration time data elimination half life t1 2 calculated 0 693 k the area drug concentration time curve h auc 0 48 calculated trapezoidal rule the area drug concentration time curve h in nity auc 0 drug auc calculated auc c48 k c48 drug concentration drug h dosing the apparent drug clearance cloral calculated dose drug auc this clearance term in uenced absolute drug bioavailability determined study the peak drug concentration cmax time cmax tmax determined graphically for psychomotor function parameter mean area e ecttime curve h auc 0 48 calculated trapezoidal rule statistical analyses performed wilcoxon signed rank test mann whitney test spearman rank test using spss j windows spss japan inc tokyo japan a p value regarded statistically signi cant,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
11831544,Effect of drug at steady state on the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile of drug in healthy volunteers.,"Modafinil has been reported to produce a concentration-related suppression of CYP2C9 activity in vitro in primary cultures of drug hepatocytes. To determine whether this effect occurs in vivo, the pharmacokinetics of (S)-drug was investigated after single drug doses of racemic drug (5 drug; COUMADIN) in a placebo-controlled, single-blind, single-period study in 28 volunteers. Subjects received an drug dose of drug prior to administration of drug (200 drug for 7 days, followed by 400 drug for 21 days) or placebo and they received another after 4 weeks of treatment. Treatment with drug did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of (S)- or (R)-drug relative to placebo. Since (S)-drug is predominantly metabolized via CYP2C9, the results indicate that the marked suppression of CYP2C9 activity in vitro does not translate into a similar effect clinically. However, limitations arising from investigation of single doses of drug preclude global conclusions about the potential for more subtle interactions after chronic drug administration.","Clinical Trial

8331208,Effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment on drug pharmacokinetics.,"The pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of drug (C) and its drug-hydroxy-drug (HC) metabolite were determined after a multiple-dose drug drug regimen (250 drug twice daily for five doses) in six healthy subjects and seven patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Pugh grades B and C). Plasma and urine C and HC concentrations were determined using drug-performance drug chromatography. Hepatic impairment resulted in increased harmonic mean C terminal disposition half-life and mean +/- SD C drug clearance (CLR) compared with drug volunteers (5.0 vs. 3.3 hr and 170 +/- 69 vs. 111 +/- 17 mL/min, respectively). Hepatic impairment also resulted in decreased metabolite peak drug concentration and area under the drug concentration-versus-time curve and decreased metabolite/parent concentration ratios compared with drug volunteers. These data suggest that drug-hydroxylation of C was drug by moderate to severe hepatic impairment. No adverse events were noted in either study group and there were drug study-related clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters. The decrease in C metabolic clearance appears to be partially offset by an increase in C CLR, resulting in comparable steady-state concentrations of parent drug. In those indications in which the metabolite may be a necessary element of the drug activity of C, it would seem prudent to be cautious in using C in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment due to drug production of HC. Otherwise, drug dosage adjustment for C appears necessary for subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment provided that drug function is not impaired.",Comparative Study ;Journal Article,methods examination laboratory profiles informed consent internal obtained approved review panel adpc scienand participation subjects volunteers six healthy comprehensive volunteers drug receiving b c hepatic hepatic impairment concomitant impairment impairment laboratory history drug drug drug subject judged history years none physiof hematologic volunteers evidence healthy drug eligible documented findings 15 subif pugh in addiimpair evidence drug dl drug evidence drug albumin drug prior treatment ergotamine 50 000 mm3 g dl function drug surgical carbamazepine evidence shunting theophylline prothrom test bili repro drug dl limit encephalopathy concurrent drug drug participants abbott received laboratories every drug least hours hours administration fasted study 250 drug drug dose abbott park five doses hours lot il all hour the drug written tific director cemaf study age cal healthy hepatic jects grade drug tion drug hematocrit rubin bin times cent cedure digitalis drug all time upper serum 11 759 al drug subjects fifth dose drug samples administration all dose tubes drug doses samples promptly subsequently stored collected intervals hour volumes frozen concentrations quantitated 20 176 cuntil tration arinized sis urine urine stored the obtained hours immediately adminisinto collected centrifuged frozen 20 176 cuntil administration aliquots analysis hepplasma analy dose hydroxyclarithromycin determined chromatography mixed drug dard ized drug drug drug drug evaporated drug using method known drug hc drug drug performance brief in amount a 9 0 methyloxime c drug internal drug extracted the drug residues phase redissolved injected chro dryness urine drug samples stanalkalin drug infective agents severe or subjects moder hepatic impairment and drug mm id x identical urine sample drug consisted used preparation preparation sample reverse phase drug mobile procethe col c 8 phenophase cm ca drug drug v v drug naoh effluent monitored model 5100a bedford second respectively v compounds urine the drug electrodes relative via environwith set the lower drug l standard compounds standard drug within curve day concentration i drug l rancho mol l palo verdes drug sciences drug the detection associates first drug l drug l less subject curve regression the drug compounds concentration ver dose stripping analyses sequential using polyex log constant cstrip rate one compart minirespecplasma cmax clear dose terminal t1 213 portion disposition estimated fitted the model curve concentrations obtained drug cmax observation curve area curve concentration versus time dosing interval estimation apparent calculated volume calculated clr drug analyses freq time auco_12 apparent drug dividing calculated body distribution dividing calculated excreted steady cl ke drug dividing urine interval race statistical data using done sex significance expressed ttest drug mean variables 19 level deviation unless noted otherwise matograph dure chromatograph umn zm menex consisting produce electrochemical mental potentials limit drug deviations drug day ranges urine v detection data half life terminal open drug for sus time subjected ponential nonlin 1718 kg linear drug mum tively concentration versus time drug 12 hour trapezoidal ance auc012 state clearance amount auc v 1 cl statistical all procedures sessed standard,PK Trial,Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial,Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial
17192770,effect of OATP1B transporter inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy volunteers.,"The inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters, such as OATP1B1, on the pharmacokinetics of drug is unknown. Here, we investigate the effect of a model hepatic transporter inhibitor, drug, on the kinetics of drug and its metabolites in humans. The inhibitory effect of a single drug dose on drug kinetics was studied in 11 healthy volunteers in a randomized, crossover study. Each subject received two 40-drug doses of drug, one on study day 1 and one on study day 8, separated by 1 week. One intravenous 30-min infusion of 600 drug drug was administered to each subject on either study day 1 or study day 8. Plasma concentrations of drug and metabolites were above the limits of quantitation for up to 24 h after dosing. Rifampin significantly increased the drug area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) of drug drug by 6.8+/-2.4-fold and that of 2-hydroxy-drug drug and 4-hydroxy-drug drug by 6.8+/-2.5- and 3.9+/-2.4-fold, respectively. The AUC values of the drug forms of drug, 2-hydroxy-drug and 4-hydroxy-drug, were also significantly increased, but to a lower extent. An intravenous dose of drug substantially increased the drug concentrations of drug and its drug and drug metabolites. The data confirm that OATP1B transporters represent the major hepatic uptake systems for drug and its active metabolites. Inhibition of hepatic uptake may have consequences for efficacy and toxicity of drug like drug that are mainly eliminated by the hepatobiliary system.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial

16198653,Effect of OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) variant alleles on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy volunteers.,"Pitavastatin is a potent, newly developed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. We characterized the effects of drug anion transporting polypeptide 1 B 1 (OATP 1 B 1) alleles *1a, *1b, and *15 on the pharmacokinetics of drug. Twenty-drug healthy Korean volunteers who had previously participated in a pharmacokinetic study of drug (single drug dose, 1--8 drug) were further investigated. Subjects were grouped according to OATP 1 B 1 genotype. Dose-normalized area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak drug concentration (C(max)) values were analyzed, because different dosages were administered to subjects, whereas the pharmacokinetics showed linear characteristics. Dose-normalized drug AUCs for *1b/*1b (group 1), *1a/*1a or *1a/*1b (group 2), and *1a/*15 or *1b/*15 (group 3) were 38.8+/-13.3, 54.4 +/-12.4, and 68.1+/-6.3 drug.h.mL(-1).drug(-1) (mean+/-SD), respectively, with significant differences between all 3 groups (P=.008) and between subjects carrying and those not carrying the *15 allele (P = .004). Dose-normalized drug C(max) values were 13.2+/- 3.3, 18.2+/-5.7, and 29.4+/- 9.6 drug.mL(-1).drug(-1) in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and also showed significant differences (P=.003) in a manner similar to that shown by AUC. No significant differences were found between the genotype groups in terms of dose-normalized AUC or C(max) values of drug drug. OATP 1 B 1 variant haplotypes were found to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug. These results suggest that the *15 allele is associated with decreased drug uptake from drug into hepatocytes and that OATP 1 B 1 genetic polymorphisms have drug effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug

9049584,Effect of route of administration of drug on the interaction between drug and drug.,"Midazolam is a short-acting drug drug extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 enzyme. Orally ingested drug antimycotics, including drug, interfere with the metabolism of drug drug during its absorption and elimination phases. We compared the effect of drug and intravenous drug on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally ingested drug. A double-dummy, randomized, cross-drug study in three phases was performed in 9 healthy volunteers. The subjects were given orally drug 400 drug and intravenously saline within 60 min; orally placebo and intravenously drug 400 drug; and orally placebo and intravenously saline. An drug dose of 7.5 drug drug was ingested 60 min after drug intake of drug/placebo, i.e. at the end of the corresponding infusion. Plasma concentrations of drug, drug-hydroxymidazolam and drug were determined and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 h. Both drug and intravenous drug significantly increased the area under the drug drug concentration-time curve (AUC0-3, AUC0-17) 2- to 3-fold, the elimination half-life of drug 2.5-fold and its peak concentration (Cmax) 2- to 2.5-fold compared with placebo.

17687273,Effect of drug and drug on the pharmacokinetics of the drug drug.,"This study investigated the effect of drug and drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy volunteers. Plasma concentrations of drug and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) were measured after ingestion of 75 drug drug without pretreatment (control), after drug pretreatment, or after drug pretreatment. During the drug phase, the area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) of drug was on average 490% (P<0.001) and that of ODV 57% (P<0.001) of the corresponding control value. Terbinafine decreased the AUC(0-infinity) drug of ODV drug drug by 82% (P<0.001). Voriconazole slightly increased the sum of AUC(0-infinity) of drug plus AUC(0-infinity) of ODV (active moiety) by 31% (P<0.001). The most likely mechanism for the interaction between drug and drug is the inhibition of CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation of drug, whereas the minor effects of drug are probably due to the inhibition of CYP3A4-, CYP2C9-, or CYP2C19-mediated metabolism of drug.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods in view previous studies 21 calculated subjects

21825288,Effect of the drug C virus drug inhibitor drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug and drug.,"Telaprevir is a drug C virus drug inhibitor that is both a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A. Amlodipine and drug are both substrates of CYP3A and are among the drug most frequently used by patients with drug C. This study was conducted to examine the effect of drug on drug and drug pharmacokinetics (PK). This was an open-label, single sequence, nonrandomized study involving 21 healthy male and drug volunteers. A coformulation of 5 drug drug and 20 drug drug was administered on day 1. Telaprevir was taken with drug as a 750-drug dose every 8 h from day 11 until day 26, and a single dose of the drug-drug combination was readministered on day 17. Plasma samples were collected for determination of the PK of drug, drug, drug, ortho-hydroxy drug, and para-hydroxy drug. When administration with drug was compared with administration without drug, the least-square mean ratios (90% confidence limits) for drug were 1.drug (1.21, 1.33) for the drug drug concentration in serum (C(max)) and 2.79 (2.58, 3.01) for the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0-_)); for drug, they were drug.6 (8.74, 12.9) for the C(max) and 7.88 (6.84, 9.07) for the AUC(0-_). Telaprevir significantly increased exposure to drug and drug, consistent with the inhibitory effect of drug on the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of these agents.","Clinical Trial ;Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","materials and methods volunteers. twenty-one healthy male (n _ 15) and drug (n _ 6) volunteers were enrolled at the covance clinical research unit, inc., daytona beach, fl. the drug volunteers were documented not to have childbearing potential. at screening, the volunteers were judged to be in good health on the drug of drug history, physical examination, and routine laboratory measurement re- sults. volunteers had ended any short-drug courses of drug medica- tions, herbal drug, or dietary supplements (e.g., drug. johnï¿½s wort, drug biloba, drug supplements), drug, seville oranges, drug, or drug juice at least drug days before the administration of the _rst dose of the study drug. drug drug were not administered during the study. volunteers had stopped drug-the-counter drug drug less than 2 days before the _rst administration of the study drug. occasional use of drug or drug was allowed during the study for the treatment of drug. volunteers could not consume drug from 72 h before the _rst dose of the study drug through the follow-up visit and were nonsmokers (subjects who stopped smoking at least 6 months before screening were considered nonsmokers). the protocol and informed-consent form were approved in accordance with national procedures. all volunteers provided written informed consent before participating in the study. the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki, good clinical practice guidelines, and local laws and regulations. study design. this was a phase 1, open-label, single-center, nonrandomized study of drug in combination with drug tablets containing 5 drug of am- lodipine and 20 drug of drug (drug-drug). volunteers re- ceived the following treatment: a single dose of drug-drug alone on day 1, followed by a washout period, drug at a dose of 750 drug every 8 h (q8h) on days 11 through 26, with a single dose of drug-drug on day 4569 4570 lee et al. antimicrob. agents chemother. 17. outpatient visits occurred at the screening visit (between 3 and 28 days before the _rst administration of the study drug); on days 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 through drug, and 21 through drug; and at a _nal safety visit approximately 6 days after the last dose of the study drug. volunteers were con_ned to the clinical research unit on days _1 to 2, drug to 11, and 15 to 20. drug administered. drug (375-drug tablets, patheon, mississauga, on- tario, canada) was administered at 750 drug q8h orally in the fed state (30 min after the start of a meal or snack). drug-drug (25-drug _xed dose combination tablets containing 5 drug drug and 20 drug drug; p_zer incorporated, new york, ny) was administered orally as a single dose in accordance with the package insert 30 min after the start of breakfast (1). during the study, compliance was assessed on an ongoing drug by counting returned dosage units and reviewing the volunteer logs. all volunteers were _90% compliant with the drug dosing regimen, and all volunteers received their scheduled doses of drug-drug (administered at the clinic). bioanalysis. pharmacokinetic evaluations were based on the concentrations of drug, drug, ortho-hydroxy drug, para-hydroxy drug, and drug in drug. drug drug, drug, ortho-hydroxy drug, and para-hydroxy drug concentrations were determined predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, drug, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, and 240 h after a single dose of drug-drug on day 1 and predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, drug, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, and 240 h after another single dose of drug-drug on day 17. neither drug drug drug is an inhibitor of drug, while drug is a potent inhibitor of drug. thus, an effect of drug and drug on drug pharmacokinetics (pk) was not anticipated. therefore, drug pk were evaluated only on day 17 and compared to those found historically. drug drug concentrations were determined at steady state predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h after the morning dose of drug on day 17. analysis of all drug samples was performed using validated drug chroma- tography (drug phase) followed by drug mass spectrometry (drug/drug/drug) methods at covance bioanalytical services, llc (indianapolis, in). analytes and their internal standards (drug-d4 maleic drug, drug-d5 drug drug, ortho-hydroxy drug-phenyl-d5, para-hydroxy drug-phenyl-d5, and d11-drug) were extracted from drug drug by drug-drug extrac- tion. after evaporation under drug, the residue of all analytes was reconsti- tuted and analyzed using drug/drug/drug with selected ion monitoring in the posi- tive-ion mode. calibration curves were generated using weighted (1/x2) linear least-square (ls) regression. the standard curve range was 0.0500 to 25.0 drug/drug for drug (lower limit of quantitation [lloq], 0.0500 drug/drug), 0.250 to 100 drug/drug for drug (lloq, 0.250 drug/drug), 0.250 to 100 drug/drug for para-hydroxy drug (lloq, 0.250 drug/drug), 0.250 to 100 drug/drug for ortho-hydroxy atorv- astatin (lloq, 0.250 drug/drug), and 2.00 to 1,000 drug/drug for drug (lloq, 2.00 drug/drug). the calibration curves and quality control data all met the prespeci_ed accep- tance criteria for each batch of samples assayed. pharmacokinetic analyses. pharmacokinetic analyses were carried out using winnonlin, version 5.0.1 (pharsight corporation, mountain view, ca). stan- dard noncompartmental analyses for computation of the area under the concen- tration-time curve (auc) were conducted. the drug observed drug con- centration in serum (cmax) and the time required to achieve the cmax (tmax) were determined directly from the data obtained. the auc was computed using the linear trapezoidal rule between increasing concentrations and the log trapezoidal rule between decreasing concentrations. the auc extrapolated to in_nity (auc0-_) was computed as the cumulative auc to the time (tlast) of the last quanti_able concentration (clast), i.e., auclast, plus the extrapolated auc from tlast to in_nity. auctlast-_ was estimated by dividing the clast by the terminal elimination rate constant (_z). the terminal half-life (t1/2) was calculated as ln(2)/_z, and drug clearance (cl/f, where f is drug bioavailability) was calculated by dividing the dose by the auc0-_. for all pharmacokinetic measurements and parameters, appropriate descrip- tive statistics were calculated, which included the arithmetic mean, the arithmetic standard deviation (drug), and the number of volunteers. the drug-drug interaction was assessed by the linear mixed-effects model- ing method using winnonlin. the pharmacokinetic parameters (cmax, auclast, and auc0-_) of drug and drug following a single dose of drug-drug coadministered with drug were compared to those measured following a single dose of drug-drug alone. in the analysis, treatment effect (with or without drug) was considered a _xed effect and subject was a random effect. geometric ls means for each treatment and 90% con_dence interval (drug) for the geometric ls mean drug fig. 1. mean drug concentration-time pro_le of drug fol- lowing drug administration with and without drug. error bars represent the standard error of the mean.

16003291,Effect of drug on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug: in vivo evidence of involvement of P-glycoprotein in drug disposition.,"A recent in vitro study has shown that drug is a substrate of P-glycoprotein. The aim of this study was to confirm the effects of drug, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of drug. Two 6-day courses of either 240 drug drug daily, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, or placebo were administered in a randomized crossover fashion with at least a 4-week washout period. Twelve male volunteers took a single drug 1-drug dose of drug on day 6 of both courses. Plasma concentrations of drug, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and drug were monitored up to 24 hours after dosing. Compared with placebo, drug treatment significantly increased the peak drug concentration of drug by 1.8-fold and the area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 24 hours of drug by 2.0-fold but did not alter the elimination half-life. The AUC from 0 to 24 hours of 9-hydroxyrisperidone, but not other pharmacokinetic parameters, was significantly increased during drug treatment. However, the AUC from 0 to 4 hours and the AUC from 0 to 8 hours of drug concentrations were not increased by drug treatment despite the pharmacokinetic alterations.

18520949,Effects of drug/drug or drug/drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug.,"Rosuvastatin (RSV) is a potent drug with a lower potential for drug interactions. However, recent data have revealed unexpected increases in RSV concentrations with drug/drug. The objective is to study the pharmacokinetic interaction of RSV with drug/drug (ATV/RTV) or drug/drug (FPV/RTV). In a prospective pharmacokinetic drug interaction study, six HIV-seronegative, healthy adult volunteers received single drug-drug doses of RSV at baseline and after 6 days of ATV/RTV and FPV/RTV, with 6-day washout periods. Plasma concentrations of RSV and its metabolites, N-desmethyl-RSV and RSV-drug, were measured by using a internally validated drug mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method drug 24 hours. Compared to baseline, the area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC 0-24h) and drug drug concentration (Cmax) of RSV increased by 213% and 600%, respectively, and the time to reach Cmax was shorter (1.75 h vs. 2.91 h) when given with ATV/RTV (P < 0.05). However, coadministration with FPV/RTV did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of RSV. The AUC 0-24h of N-desmethyl-RSV was not significantly affected by either drug, but that of RSV-drug increased (P < 0.05) by 61% and 76% after coadministration with ATV/RTV and FPV/RTV, respectively. ATV/RTV significantly increases the drug concentrations of drug, most likely by increasing drug's drug bioavailability.

The CYP drug responsible for drug metabolite formation were assessed using recombinant expressed CYPs and CYP-drug inhibitors. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transport was tested in MDCK cells expressing the drug MDR1 gene. The effects of CYP3A4 inhibition were evaluated clinically in 12 healthy volunteers that received 25 drug drug before and after 4 days of treatment with drug 200 drug daily. To assess CYP3A4 induction in vivo, 18 patients with psychiatric disorders were titrated to steady-state drug levels (300 drug twice daily), then titrated to 600 drug daily carbamazepine for 2 weeks. CYP3A4 was found to be responsible for formation of drug drug and N- and O-desalkylquetiapine and not a Pgp substrate. In the clinical studies, drug increased mean drug drug C(max) by 3.35-fold, from 45 to 150 drug drug(-1) (mean C(max) drug 90% CI 2.51, 4.47) and decreased its clearance (Cl/F) by 84%, from 138 to 22 l h(-1) (mean drug 90% CI 0.13, 0.20). Carbamazepine decreased drug drug C(max) by 80%, from 1042 to 205 drug drug(-1) (mean C(max) drug 90% CI 0.drug, 0.28) and increased its clearance 7.5-fold, from 65 to 483 l h(-1) (mean drug 90% CI 6.04, 9.28). Cytochrome P450 3A4 is a primary enzyme responsible for the metabolic clearance of drug.

participants healthy male volunteers aged 24_42 years were enrolled in study 1. exclusion criteria included a posi- tive test for drug b surface antigen or drug immu- node_ciency virus (drug) drug; abnormalities in baseline laboratory values or electrocardiographic _nd- ings; presence of an acute nonpsychiatric illness within 2 weeks before enrolment; and use of drug that affect the cyp enzyme system within 6 weeks before study initiation. study participants were asked to limit their drug intake and refrain from making major changes in their dietary habits throughout the study. use of pre- scription and drug drug was prohib- ited unless deemed appropriate by the investigator. patients in study 2 were men and women aged 29_ 63 years; met dsm-iv-tr criteria [12] for schizophre- nia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder; and were in remission from an acute exacerbation of their disorder for at least 3 months. all patients had been treated with drug drug during the year before enrolment and were in remission without psy- chotic symptoms at time of enrolment into the study. some subjects had adverse events on their previous drug, and because of the lower incidence of dys- tonic movements on drug, were considered to be eligible and good candidates to be switched to quetiap- ine. the subjects were withdrawn from any previous drug and started on drug within 4 days of their last dose of previous antischizophrenic treatment, and were titrated to a drug dose of drug (300 drug twice per day). the drug dose ensured that even with the enzyme induction secondary to carbamazepine, the sub- jects would be receiving effective exposures to quetiap- ine. the subjects all were inpatients during the study and were closely observed so that if there was any sign of relapse of the acute psychotic state, the carbamazepine would be terminated and the subject aggressively treated. during the study none of the subjects had an acute relapse of their psychosis (see clinical effect in the results section). patients taking drug for schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder were allowed to continue doing so if their dose had been stable for at least 1 month before enrollment. all other drug, drug or mood-stabilizing drug except drug were dis- continued at enrolment. only drug drug hydrate and drug mesylate were permitted to treat agitation, insomnia or extrapyramidal symptoms. drug was the only drug allowed throughout the study. women of childbearing age were allowed to participate only if they were not pregnant and were using a reliable nonhormonal method of contraception. exclusions included a dsm-iv-tr axis i disorder other than schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar dis- order; a positive test for drug b surface antigen or drug drug; presence of an acute nonpsychiatric ill- ness during the 2 weeks before study entry; use of cloz- drug interactions and drug pharmacokinetics apine within 2 months of enrolment; or use of cyp inducers or inhibitors within 6 weeks of enrolment. the study in healthy volunteers was conducted at christiana care research institute in newark, delaware and was approved by the institutional review board of christiana care health services. the patient study was conducted at two sites: cincinnati va hospital and bhc alhambra hospital, rosemead, california. the drug- sity of cincinnati drug center institutional review board and the western institutional review board drug- proved the study, and the study protocol adhered to the ethical guidelines of the declaration of helsinki. each subject gave informed consent. at the time of enrollment into the study, all of the patients were in remission, with- out active psychotic behaviour and were judged by the investigator to be capable of giving informed consent. study design study 1 was an 8-day, open-label, crossover trial in volunteers who resided at the clinical research centre during the study. after an 8-h fast, study participants were given a single drug dose of drug (25 drug) at 08.00 h on days 1 and 6. single drug doses of ketocon- drug (200 drug day ) were administered at 06.00 h from day 3 through day 6. drug was taken at least

Randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study Clinical Studies Ltd., Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Twelve healthy subjects. Treatment A: LTG 100 drug with steady-state BUP 150 drug twice/day; treatment B: LTG 100 drug. The pharmacokinetics of LTG were determined by noncompartmental methods using drug and urine concentrations. Geometric least squares mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals were calculated for treatment comparison. Safety assessments included clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events monitoring. Pharmacokinetic parameters of LTG were not significantly different between treatments. Five subjects experienced seven mild, potentially drug-related adverse events (insomnia [2]; nausea, headache, facial drug, fatigue, and depression [1 each]) that resolved spontaneously. Steady-state BUP caused drug clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of LTG.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods subjects men women aged years eligible enrollment provided good health determined drug history physical examination electrocardiogram ecg clinical laboratory measurements women surgically sterile postmenopausal intrauterine device method birth control subjects excluded history predisposition seizures diagnosis anorexia nervosa bulimia recreational drug users moderate heavy consumers drug a local institutional review board approved protocol informed consent form subjects required sign study study design this single center study open label randomized two way crossover design subjects assigned receive two treatments a b random order in treatment a subjects received drug drug orally once day days followed drug drug twice day day minimum 8 hour interval successive doses single drug ltg 100 drug dispersible tablet day in treatment b subjects received single drug ltg 100 drug dispersible tablet there days ltg doses subjects groups admitted clinical research unit hours ltg dosing at midnight began overnight fast continued hour ltg dose in treatment a morning drug dose administered ltg drug samples drug determine drug ltg ltg gluc concentrations obtained immediately hours ltg dose subjects released unit 24 hour drug sample collected returned provide remaining drug samples urine samples measure ltggluc concentrations collected ltg administration treatment phase time hours hours in treatment a additional drug samples collected days measure trough drug metabolite concentrations confirm steady state drug drug levels achieved drug urine samples stored 20 c analysis safety assessed physical examinations ecg vital signs adverse event monitoring clinical laboratory test results at screening days study began follow up visits last drug sampling time subjects underwent physical examination included 12 lead ecg vital signs monitoring collection drug urine samples clinical laboratory tests in addition vital signs monitored hours ltg dose adverse events collected spontaneous reports elicited first dose study drug study termination drug assays drug samples analyzed ltg using time resolved immunofluorometric assay 25 the ltg gluc concentrations drug urine pharmacotherapy volume number determined drug performance drug chromatography ultraviolet detection drug samples analyzed drug h drug tbup e drug using drug chromatography assay drug mass spectrometry detection 26 the precision bias assays generally pharmacokinetic analysis drug ltg ltg gluc concentration versus time data analyzed noncompartmental methods using computer software winnonlin professional version pharsight corp cary nc the drug drug concentration cmax time taken reach cmax tmax determined directly concentration time data the area concentration time curve last serum concentration time point auclast calculated linear trapezoidal method the terminal phase rate constant lz estimated linear regression log transformed concentration time data using minimum three samples the auc time zero infinity auc determined adding auclast remaining area calculated dividing last quantifiable concentration clast lz drug clearance cl f ltg calculated dividing dose auc terminal phase half life calculated ln2 lz formation clearance clf ltg gluc calculated according following equation drug clf aucm aucm aucp aucm aucp equal aucs ltggluc ltg extrapolated infinity respectively drug 48 equals amount ltggluc excreted urine hours aucm equals auc hours ltggluc this relationship valid metabolite ltg gluc eliminated entirely kidneys statistical analyses all statistical analyses conducted using drug version drug cary nc for parameters tmax analysis variance log transformation performed taking account sources variation due subject sequence period treatment geometric least squares mean ratios drug calculated treatment comparison for tmax treatments compared estimated median difference tmax associated drug using standard koch procedure drug equivalence determined back transformed exponentiated confidence intervals drug difference least squares means log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters contained range based intrasubject variability auc single drug dose ltg glaxo wellcome inc data file sample subjects would provide greater power demonstrate equivalence ltg pharmacokinetics administration drug test treatment administration alone reference treatment,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
21434975,Eltrombopag increases drug drug exposure in healthy volunteers.,"OATP1B1 is important for hepatic uptake of drug and BCRP is important for drug absorption and elimination. Eltrombopag inhibits OATP1B1 and BCRP in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. Inhibition of these transporters could change drug-lowering efficacy and increase the risk of exposure-dependent toxicities. To determine if co-administration of drug with drug alters drug drug exposure, an open-label study was conducted in 42 healthy adult subjects. Concomitant administration of drug with drug was associated with increased drug exposure via inhibition of drug transporters. The therapeutic index of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors may be drug by the concomitant use of drug. In subjects taking drug, a drug dose of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors may be needed. Eltrombopag, an drug, nonpeptide drug receptor agonist, inhibits the drug anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and breast cancer resistance drug (BCRP) in vitro. OATP1B1 is important for hepatic uptake of drug and inhibition of this transporter could reduce drug-lowering efficacy and increase the risk of exposure-dependent toxicities. In contrast, BCRP is an efflux transporter and inhibition of this transporter could increase both hepatic and drug drug concentrations, resulting in increased efficacy and toxicity. To determine if co-administration of drug with drug alters drug drug exposure, an open-label study was conducted in 42 healthy adult subjects. Subjects received drug and drug orally: day 1, drug drug drug single dose; days 6 to 9, drug 75 drug once daily; day drug, drug 75 drug once daily and drug drug drug single dose.

method based on drug precipitation, followed by hplc/ drug/drug analysis. using a 50 drug aliquot of drug, the lower limit of quanti_cation for the drug assay was 100 drug drug-1 and the higher limit of quanti_cation was 50 000 drug drug-1. each batch of drug samples was run against freshly prepared duplicate calibration standards (n = 9). imprecision and inaccuracy between assays were <drug%. qc samples at three concentrations (400, 4000, and 40 000 drug drug-1) were assayed along with study samples and the calculated qc sample concentrations deviated by <15% from the actual concentrations. the primary pk endpoints were drug drug con- centration (cmax) and area under the drug concentration vs. time curve starting from dosing and extrapolated to in_nity (auc(0,ï¿½)) of drug when administered alone or co-administered with drug. cmax and the _rst time to reach cmax (tmax) were the actual observed values.the auc was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule for each incremental trapezoid and the log trapezoidal rule for each decremental trapezoid. the auc from time zero to the last measurable concentration (auc(0,t)) and auc(0,ï¿½) was determined. values for auc(0,ï¿½) were esti- mated as the sum of auc(0,t) and ct divided by the elimi- nation rate constant (lz), where ct was the last observed quanti_able concentration. steady-state drug drug cmax and auc drug a dosing interval (auc(0,t)) were estimated for the combina- tion regimen only. in addition, drug drug trough concentrations collected on day drug prior to administra- tion of drug co- administration were measured. drug and 24 h after to assess the effects of drug on drug pk, log transformed drug drug auc(0,ï¿½) and cmax were analyzed separately by analysis of variance (anova) _tting terms for treatment and subject. point estimates and associated 90% con_dence intervals (drug) for the differ- ences were constructed using the appropriate error term. the point and interval estimates on the log scale were then back-transformed to give point and interval estimates for the ratios. drug drug and drug pk parameters were summarized by treatment and by race and gender within treatment. drug drug concentration_time pro_les were plotted by treatment, race and gender. drug drug auc(0,ï¿½) was plotted by genotype combination (approach 2 as described in the following paragraph). subgroup analyses were conducted as secondary analyses. similar to the primary statistical analysis, drug drug pk values br j clin pharmacol / 72:2 / 323 a. j. allred et al. were compared between treatments for subgroups based on race (asian vs. drug-asian) and gender. multivariate analyses of the relationship between day 1 drug drug auc(0,ï¿½) and cmax and potential cova- riates was completed. the analysis included race (asian vs. drug-asian), gender, body weight, and oatp1b1 (slco1b1) a388g and t521c and bcrp (abcg2) c421a genotypes. genotypes were included three ways. approach

15963095,Enantioselective disposition of drug in relation to CYP2C19 genotypes in the presence of drug.,"Lansoprazole is affected by polymorphism of CYP2C19. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of drug, a CYP2C19 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of each drug enantiomer among three different CYP2C19 genotype groups. Eighteen healthy subjects, of whom six each were homozygous extensive metabolizers (homEMs), heterozygous extensive metabolizers (hetEMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, participated in the study. Each subject received either placebo or drug, 25 drug twice daily for 6 days, then a single drug dose of 60 drug of racemic drug. The drug concentrations of drug enantiomers and drug drug were subsequently measured for 24 h post drug administration using drug chromatography. In the homEMs and hetEMs, drug significantly increased the AUC(0, infinity) and C(max) and prolonged the elimination half-life of both (R)- and (S)-drug, whereas in the PMs, the only statistically significant effect of drug was on the AUC(0, infinity) for (R)-drug. The mean drug-mediated percent increase in the AUC(0, infinity) of (R)-drug in the homEMs compared with the PMs was significant (P = 0.0117); however, C(max) did not differ among the three CYP2C19 genotypes. On the other hand, drug induced a significant percent increase in both the AUC(0, infinity) and C(max) for (S)-drug in the homEMs compared with the hetEMs (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0125, respectively) as well as compared with the PMs (P < 0.0001 for each parameter). The mean R : S drug for AUC(0, infinity) of drug in the homEMs was significantly different between the placebo and the drug treatment groups (12.7 (9.1, 16.8) vs 6.4 (5.4, 7.4), respectively, P < 0.0001), though not in the PMs (5.5 (4.3, 6.7) vs 5.9 (5.3, 6.5), respectively). The magnitude of the contribution of CYP2C19 to the metabolism of (S)-drug is much greater compared with that of the (R)-enantiomer. In extensive metabolizers, hepatic CYP2C19 plays an important role in the absorption and elimination of drug, particularly the (S)-enantiomer.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods eighteen healthy subjects six homozygous extensive metabolizers homems heterozygous extensive metabolizers hetems poor metabolizers pms cyp2c19 participated study each subject received either placebo uvoxamine drug twice daily days single drug dose drug racemic drug the drug concentrations drug enantiomers drug drug subsequently measured h post drug administration using drug chromatography methods subjects eighteen healthy japanese subjects homozygous exten sive metabolizer group homems heterozygous poor extensive metabolizer group hetems selected particmetabolizer group pms n ipate study the subjects enrolled present study participated previous study the mean age years mean weight range years kg range kg there differ56 6 genotypes homems ences among three hetems pms respect age years respectively body weight kg cyp2c19 br j clin pharmacol kg respectively body mass index respectively male drug ratios group none subjects history signi cant drug illness hypersensitivity drug subjects smokers the study protocol approved ethics committee hirosaki university hospital subjects gave written informed consent prior study participation study protocol a randomized double blind placebo controlled crossover study design conducted intervals weeks after uvoxamine drug capsule form containing fujisawa drug co ltd tablet drug osaka japan matched placebo capsule form appearance size uvoxamine given orally twice day h h days subject received drug dose drug takeda drug co drug takepron ltd osaka japan drug tap drug h venous drug samples taken drug administration h drug taken measure drug concentration drug enantiomers drug drug the samples centrifuged g immediately collection stored c analysis all subjects fasted h administration drug standard meal h later drug caffeinated beverages forbidden study period identify genotyping cyp2c19 3 exon cyp2c19 the genotyping procedure used wild type gene two mutant alleles cyp2c19 exon cyp2c19 2 performed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism pcr rflp method genotype analysis revealed different patterns follows three one patient subjects genotype patterns divided three groups homems n hetems pms six three cyp2c19 n n analysis drug enantiomers metabolites drug the drug concentrations drug enantiomers drug drug determined hplc solid phase extraction method miura et al the hplc column used chiral cd drug mm mm i d shiseido co ltd tokyo japan the mobile phase consisted m naclo4 drug drug v v a ow rate drug min 1 used ambient temperature wavelength set nm the lower limit quanti cation assay drug drug 1 drug enantiomers drug drug 1 drug drug the coef cient variation interand intraday assays n less accuracy n within analytes concentration range drug drug 1 pharmacokinetic analysis pharmacokinetic analysis drug enantiomers drug drug carried standard noncompartmental method using winnonlin pharsight co ca version the elimination halflife obtained log linear regression terminal phase concentration time data least three sampling points elimination half life ln2 lz lz elimination rate constant the drug area observed drug concentration time curve auc calculated using linear trapezoidal rule extrapolation auc last measurable concentration ct in nity auc t performed adding value ct lz ct drug concentration h drug administration the drug drug concentration cmax time required reach peak tmax directly obtained pro le statistical analysis all results expressed mean values drug con dence intervals drug statistical comparisons parameters supplemented multiple comparison procedure fisher using stat view drug drug institute cary nc version a p value less considered statistically signi cant,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial

A randomized, double-blind crossover study was performed with three phases separated by a washout period of 3 weeks. Twelve young, healthy volunteers took orally either 1.5 drug/day drug, 240 drug/day drug, or placebo for 2 days. On day 2, 40 drug drug was administered orally. Serum concentrations of drug, drug drug, drug, drug, and drug were measured for up to 24 hours. Erythromycin and drug increased mean peak serum concentration (Cmax) of unchanged drug 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 2.6-fold (p < 0.05) and the area under the serum drug concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] 6.2-fold (p < 0.001) and 4.6-fold (p < 0.01). Erythromycin increased the mean Cmax of active drug drug fivefold (p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) 3.9-fold (p < 0.001). Verapamil increased the Cmax of drug drug 3.4-fold (p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) 2.8-fold (p < 0.001). There was more than tenfold interindividual variability in the extent of drug interaction with both drug and drug. Both drug and drug interact considerably with drug, probably by inhibiting its drug P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated metabolism. Concomitant administration of drug, drug, or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 with drug should be avoided. As an alternative, the dosage of drug should be drug considerably, that is, by about 50% to 80%, at least when a drug dosage higher than 20 drug/day is used. Possible adverse effects, such as elevation of creatine kinase level and muscle tenderness, should be closely monitored when such drug are used.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods study design eight male drug drug healthy volunteers age range years weight range kg participated study gave written informed consent table i each volunteer ascertained healthy means drug history physical examination 12 lead electrocardiogram routine laboratory tests drug hemoglobin serum drug creatine kinase alt only subjects systolic drug pressure mm hg heart rate rest beats min included none subjects receiving continuous drug except one drug subject using drug drug drug three subjects smokers the study protocol approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki finnish national agency drug a randomized double blind three phase crossover study design interval weeks phases used the volunteers received three pretreatments drug drug drug max drug tablet astra sodertalje sweden drug drug isoptin drug tablet knoll ludwigshafen germany matched placebo orally three times day am pm pm days on day drug drug two drug drug tablets merck sharp dohme haarlem the netherlands administered orally drug drug am hours fourth dose pretreatment the volunteers fasted hours administration drug warm standard meal hours light standard meal hours afterward drug sampling determination serum drug concentrations on days administration drug plastic cannula inserted forearm vein kept patent obturator drug sampled siliconized venoject tubes terumo europe leuven belgium timed drug samples drug collected immediately administration drug hours administration serum separated within minutes divided drug tubes stored c analyzed serum concentrations drug drug drug determined means hplc lt drug used internal standard the limit quantitation rig drug compounds the interassay coefficient variation drug rig drug n drug drug rig drug n serum concentrations drug drug determined means hplc t2js methoxyverapamil used internal standard the limit quantitation rig drug compounds the interassay coefficient variation drug rig drug n drug rig drug n serum drug concentrations determined means hplc drug roxithromycin used internal standard the limit quantitation drug drug the interassay coefficient variation drug drug drug n pharmacokinetic calculations the pharmacokinetits drug characterized appropriate peak concentration serum c concentration peak time tmax elimination half life tl area serum concentration time curve time zero hours auc o 24 the elimination rate constant k determined means linear regression analysis log linear phase serum drug concentration time curve the ty2 value calculated tl ln2 k the auc o 24 calculated use trapezoidal rule the observed drug drug drug values rig drug higher regarded rig drug calculation auc values used calculation ty value the auc o 24 drug drug drug refers time hours ingestion drug hours fourth dose pretreatment statistical analysis the data expressed mean value drug case tmax median range tables mean value k se fig statistical analysis results except tmax value performed means one way anova tukey test post hoc comparisons the pharmacokinetic variables log transformed statistical analysis group variances unequal the wilcoxon signed rank test used analysis value differences regarded statistically significant p,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
10234598,Erythromycin coadministration increases drug drug concentrations.,"The effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, was investigated in 12 healthy volunteers. Each subject received a single drug drug dose of drug on two separate occasions, separated by 2 weeks. Erythromycin (500 drug qid) was given from 7 days before through 4 days after the second drug dose. Atorvastatin concentrations were determined by an enzyme inhibition assay, which measured both drug and active metabolites. When drug was coadministered with drug, mean Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) increased by 37.7% and 32.5%, respectively. Mean terminal half-life was similar following each drug dose.

16765141,Exposure of drug is unchanged but drug and drug metabolites are increased several-fold in patients with drug-induced myopathy.,"The most serious side effect from drug treatment is myopathy, which may proceed to rhabdomyolysis. This is the first study to investigate whether the pharmacokinetics of either drug or its metabolites, or both, is altered in patients with drug-related myopathy compared with healthy controls. A 24-hour pharmacokinetic investigation was performed in drug patients with drug-related myopathy. Relevant polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 (encoding drug anion transporting polypeptide 1B1), MDR1/ABCB1 (encoding P-glycoprotein), and CYP3A5 (encoding drug P450 3A5) were determined. Data from 15 healthy volunteers were used as controls. No statistically significant difference in systemic exposure of drug was observed between the 2 groups. However, patients with drug-related myopathy had 2.4-fold and 3.1-fold higher systemic exposures of the metabolites drug drug (P<.01) and p-hydroxyatorvastatin (P<.01), respectively, compared with controls. There were drug differences in frequencies of SLCO1B1, MDR1, and CYP3A5 polymorphisms between the 2 groups. This study disclosed a distinct difference in the pharmacokinetics of drug metabolites between patients with drug-related myopathy and healthy control subjects.

10579479,Fluoxetine impairs the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of drug enantiomers in healthy Chinese volunteers.,"To determine the effect of 20 drug/day drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug enantiomers and CYP2D6 activity by phenotyping with drug. Nine healthy Chinese volunteers (seven men and two women) were included in a two-phase study. Dextromethorphan (20 drug) was given before and after subjects took 20 drug/day drug for drug days, and the drug metabolic drug was calculated to determine CYP2D6 phenotype. Pharmacokinetic studies of drug enantiomers after a single drug 400 drug dose before and after pretreatment with 20 drug/day drug for drug days were also conducted in these subjects. Reversed-phase HPLC with precolumn derivatization was used to determine enantiomeric concentrations of drug in drug. Mean CYP2D6 drug metabolic ratios before and after drug therapy were 0.028 +/- 0.031 and 0.080 +/- 0.058, respectively (P = .001), indicating that a strong inhibition of CYP2D6 by drug activity was observed in Chinese subjects. Propafenone metabolism was also impaired significantly after drug treatment. The elimination half-life, peak concentration, and area under the curve from 0 hours to infinity of two enantiomers after drug therapy were significantly increased compared with those at baseline (P < .01), whereas drug clearance decreased from 75.01 +/- 17.69 L/h to 49.36 +/- 8.62 L/h for S-drug (P = .005) and from 107.62 +/- 33.82 L/h to 70.60 +/- 12.42 L/h for R-drug (P = .027). In addition, drug increased the peak concentration of S-drug by 39% and that of R-drug by 71% (P < .05). A significant increase of the time to reach peak concentration was observed only in the R-enantiomer and not in the S-enantiomer of drug after drug therapy. There were drug differences in the percentage changes of PR and QRS intervals before or after drug pretreatment at the time observed (P > .05). We drug that drug may cause significant inhibition of the CYP2D6 activity as determined by drug phenotyping. This inhibition impairs the metabolism of drug enantiomers in Chinese subjects.

11180037,Fluvoxamine inhibits the CYP2C9 catalyzed biotransformation of drug.,"Our objective was to examine the interaction between drug and drug to confirm that drug inhibits CYP2C9. The study was carried out as an open, randomized, crossover design with drug healthy participants. In period A, all volunteers took 500 drug of drug orally. In period B, the volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Each group took either 150 drug or 75 drug of drug a day for 5 days (day -3 to day 2). The groups then took 500 drug of drug as a single dose (day 0). In both periods, drug and urine were sampled at regular intervals. Plasma was analyzed for drug, and urine was analyzed for drug and its two metabolites, 4-hydroxytolbutamide and drug by means of HPLC. During treatment with drug, there was a statistically significant decrease in the median of the drug clearance of drug, from 845 mL/h to 688 mL/h, among the volunteers who received 75 drug/d. There was a reduction that reached borderline statistical significance in the group that received 150 drug/d of drug. The clearance by means of 4-hydroxytolbutamide and drug was significantly drug in both groups (ie, from 901 mL/h to 318 mL/h in the group that received 150 drug of drug per day and from 723 mL/h to 457 mL/h in the group that received 75 drug of drug per day). Thus there was a tendency toward a more pronounced inhibition of the 4-hydroxylation during treatment with 150 drug/d of drug compared with 75 drug/d, but the difference was not statistically significant. Fluvoxamine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 in vivo.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods the study carried open randomized crossover design the participants volunteers participants men median age years range years the subjects known heart drug kidney disease according clinical examination clinical chemical hematologic screening electrocardiogram drug participants consumed drug drug regular drug time study the volunteers consented participate study drug drug written information the study approved regional ethics committee danish national board health study procedure the study divided two periods in period a volunteers took drug drug drug dak nycomed denmark roskilde denmark single drug dose in period b volunteers randomly assigned two drug groups one group took drug d drug drug 100 drug tablets solvay drug bv weesp the netherlands days single drug dose drug clinical pharmacology drug volume number madsen et al fig mean drug concentrations drug among two different groups participants single drug dose drug drug period a period b concomitant intake drug d open triangles drug d open circles drug asterisk calculated samples analytical error one sample double asterisks calculated samples individuals stopped taking drug hours side effects coefficients drug variation drug drug drug drug respectively pharmacokinetics the following pharmacokinetic parameters calculated period a period b intake drug drug drug tb clearance cltb calculated follows cltb dose auc auc area drug concentration time curve calculated means trapezoidal rule extrapolation last measurable concentration infinity complete absorption drug intestine assumed 24 drug half life t1 2 calculated follows t1 2 ln2 terminal log linear slope determination means least squares regression analysis essentially whole dose recovered metabolic products single primary pathway dose excreted unchanged drug 24 for drug metabolized single pathway clearance parent drug body equal metabolic clearance plus drug clearance unchanged drug thus clearance drug cltb composed following cltb cl ohtb ctb clr clres cl ohtb ctb clearance hydroxylation clr drug clearance clres residual clearance cl ohtb cbt calculated follows cl ohtb cbt ohtb ctb 0 32 auctb 0 32 period a cl ohtb cbt ohtb ctb 0 72 auctb 0 72 period b ohtb 4 methylhydroxytolbutamide ctb drug urine hours respectively auctb 0 32 auctb 072 corresponding aucs drug the equations based assumption rate metabolite formation equals rate appearance urine collection urine complete clr tb 0 32 auctb 0 32 period a clr tb 0 72 auctb 0 72 period b tb 0 32 recovery drug tb 0 72 recovery drug hours the residual clearance drug calculated third equation clres cltb cl ohtb ctb clr statistics all pharmacokinetic parameters reported median range in groups paired median differences confidence inter madsen et al clinical pharmacology drug january table i drug partial clearances drug single drug doses drug drug period a treatment drug d drug d drug period b drug conc fluvox nmol l period b dose drug median drug median drug vs drug median difference drug drug median difference drug drug median difference drug all drug drug median difference drug drug clearance drug h clearance ohtb ctb drug h drug clearance drug h period a period b period a vs period b period a period b period a vs period b period b conc concentration fluvox drug ohtb hydroxytolbutamide ctb drug t1 2 elimination half life vs versus drug confidence interval the drug clearance calculated period a drug could detected individuals completed hours period b drug compared period a period b in periods unpaired median differences confidence intervals compared groups for types comparisons confidence interval median differences including zero considered statistically significant the influence drug drug concentration change drug clearance clearance means hydroxylation examined spearman s rank correlation analysis thus p value two tailed correlation coefficient less considered statistically significant the statistical analysis carried use medstat drug package version astra group albertslund denmark,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
9029748,Griseofulvin and drug interactions with the metabolism of theophylline.,"Theophylline is predominantly metabolized by drug P4501A2 (CYP1A2). A possible interaction between drug and theophylline was reported to our laboratory, which led us to form the hypothesis that drug induces the metabolism of theophylline. One purpose of this study was to investigate this hypothesis. The study was carried out as a randomized crossover study of 12 healthy volunteers. In period A of the study, each volunteer received a single dose of 300 drug theophylline drug orally. In period B, the subjects took drug, 50 drug for 1 day and 100 drug for 6 days, and on day 4, the subjects ingested 300 drug theophylline drug. Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, and period B was included as a positive control. In period C, the subjects took 500 drug drug for 9 days; on day 8 the subjects again ingested 300 drug theophylline drug. Theophylline and its metabolites (1-methyluric drug [IMU], 3-drug [3MX], and 1,3-dimethyluric drug [13DMU]) in drug and urine were assayed by drug-performance drug chromatography. During drug intake, the median of the drug clearance of theophylline decreased from 80 drug/min to 24 drug/min, and the half-life increased from 6.6 to 22 h. The partial formation clearances of the metabolites decreased from 17 to 1.7 drug/min, from 8.9 to 0.9 drug/min, and from 21 to 6.8 drug/min for 1MU, 3MX, and 13DMU, respectively. The results confirm that assessment of theophylline metabolism indeed serves as a biomarker for CYP1A2. During drug ingestion, the median of the drug and partial clearances of theophylline were 84 drug/min, 22 drug/min (1MU), 9.4 drug/min (3MX), and 25 drug/min (13DMU). The half-life decreased significantly from 6.6 to 5.7 h. The increase in partial formation clearances of 1MU and 13DMU, but not of 3MX, were statistically significant. The increase in the drug clearance reached only borderline significance. In drug subjects a marked induction was seen for all pharmacokinetic parameters, suggesting that the susceptibility to induction is more pronounced in some subjects. This susceptibility could theoretically be explained by a polymorphism in the inducibility of the gene coding for the CYP1A2 enzyme.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",materials and methods the study carried open randomized crossover study volunteers men median age years range years all nonsmokers known heart drug kidney diseases according clinical investigation clinical chemical hematological screening ecg test they consuming drug drug regular drug time study the volunteers consented participate study drug written verbal information study approved regional ethics committee counties vejle funen danish national board health study procedure the volunteers randomized three groups all three groups went three testing periods separated weeks washout in three periods volunteers abstained ingesting drug containing beverages foods drug days study last drug sample drawn in period a drug sample drawn intake tablet drug theophylline drug teofylamin nycomed dak copenhagen denmark containing drug theophylline thereafter drug samples drawn h urine collected h in period b volunteers received tablet drug drug solvay drug bv weesp netherlands day following days received drug drug day on day drug sample drawn intake drug theophylline drug thereafter drug samples drawn h urine collected h in period c volunteers received drug drug lamoryl l vens kemiske fabrik copenhagen denmark days on day drug sample drawn intake drug theophylline drug thereafter drug samples drawn h urine collected h chemicals reagents theophylline beta hydroxy ethyltheophylline internal standard purchased sigma drug louis mo u s a 1 methyluric drug drug 1 3 dimethyluric drug purchased fluka drug buchs switzerland all chemicals drug performance drug chromatography hplc grade obtained either merck darmstadt germany sigma drug drug osmosis distillation analytical methods drug urine analyzed theophylline metabolites hplc method described detail elsewhere for theophylline three metabolites limits detection mol l drug mol l urine the intraassay interassay coefficients variation respectively accuracy within drug urine pharmacokinetic analysis for theophylline following pharmacokinetic parameters calculated three periods the drug theophylline clearance calculated equation cl clearance auc13dmx drug area drug concentration time curve calculated trapezoidal rule extrapolation last measurable concentration infinity complete absorption theophylline intestine assumed the partial theophylline clearances calculated equations numerator amount metabolite recovered urine h auc13dmx 0 48 h corresponding auc theophylline eqs based assumption rate metabolite formation equals rate appearance urine the volume distribution vd calculated equation all pharmacokinetic parameters reported medians ranges the median difference confidence interval calculated period a without intake drug period b concomitant intake drug period a without intake drug period c concomitant intake drug a confidence interval median difference include zero considered statistically significant the statistical analysis carried medstat drug package version astra group albertslund denmark,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
16778714,Identification of a single time-point for drug drug measurement that adequately reflects area under the concentration-time curve.,"The objective of this study was to identify a single time-point for drug drug measurement that adequately reflects area under the drug drug concentration-time curve (AUC) after administration of drug alone or together with coadministration with CYP mediators. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study design in 3 phases was conducted at intervals of 2 weeks. Eighteen healthy Japanese volunteers, comprising 3 CYP2C19 genotype groups, took a single drug 60-drug dose of drug after three 6-day pretreatments, that is, drug 800 drug/d, drug 50 drug/d, and placebo. Blood samplings (drug mL each) for determination of drug were taken up to 24 hours after the administration of drug. Correlation between drug drug concentrations at drug time points and AUC0-24 were analyzed. Although there were significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug during drug and placebo among CYP2C19 genotypes, the differences were not found during drug. The drug concentrations 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after administration (C3, C4, C6, and C8, respectively) were highly correlated with AUC0-24 in coadministration with placebo, drug, and drug (r>0.8, P<0.001). In particular, C6 showed a correlation coefficient of 0.940, 0.992, and 0.953 in coadministration with placebo, drug, and drug, respectively, and was the most appropriate for estimating AUC0-24. The present study demonstrates that AUC of drug can be estimated by using a single time-point at C6. This method of drug concentration monitoring at one time-point might be more suitable for AUC estimation than reference to CYP2C19 genotypes, particularly in coadministration of CYP mediators.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods study design eighteen healthy japanese volunteers men women h pylori negative enrolled study their mean age years mean body weight kg most subjects study participated previous studies 12 13 the ethics committee hirosaki university school drug approved study protocol written informed consent obtained participant examinations the mutated alleles cyp2c19 cyp2c19 3 3 cyp2c19 2 2 identi ed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism methods de morais et al drug study the cyp2c19 genotype analyses revealed di erent patterns follows these divided groups homozygous ems n heterozygous ems n pms n a randomized double blind placebo controlled crossover study design phases conducted intervals weeks drug drug capsule containing equivalent tablets clarith taisho drug co ltd tokyo japan uvoxamine drug capsule containing equivalent tablet drug fujisawa drug co ltd osaka japan matched placebo given orally twice day am pm days six volunteers within group allocated di erent drug sequences placebo drug uvoxamine uvoxamine placebo drug drug uvoxamine placebo on day took single drug 60 drug dose drug takepron takeda drug co ltd osaka japan drug dose drug drug dose uvoxamine placebo overnight fasting am drug drug taken study periods drug meal allowed hours dosing pm the use drug tea co ee drug forbidden test days drug samplings drug sampling drug determination drug taken heparinized tubes hours administration drug drug separated immediately kept 301c analysis assay drug concentrations drug quanti ed using drug performance drug chromatography hplc method developed laboratory 15 in brief alkalization drug naoh mol l drug drug extracted drug drug etherdichloromethane vol vol the drug phase evaporated dryness 601c samples dissolved mobile phase drug drug er mol l drug drug drug vol vol injected onto c18 str ods ii hplc analytical column column ii mm id particle size shinwa chemical industry kyoto japan connected shimadzu class vp shimadzu corporation kyoto japan hplc system the ow rate drug min wavelength set nm the limit quanti cation drug drug drug intraday interday drug cient variability less drug respectively lowest concentration ranges pharmacokinetic data analyses the peak concentration cmax time peak concentration tmax obtained directly original data auc0 calculated using trapezoidal rule the terminal rate constant ke used extrapolation determined regression analysis log linear part concentration time curve subject the elimination half life determined 0 693 ke statistical analyses one way analysis variance fisher exact tests used comparisons among cyp2c19 genotypes clinical pro les age body weight sex the 2 way analysis variance comparison placebo versus either drug uvoxamine conducted pharmacokinetic parameters although analyzed statistical correction correlation di erences using bonferroni drug concentrations drug time points auc0 tested using spearman rank test a p value less regarded signi cant spss 12 0j windows spss japan inc tokyo used statistical analyses predicted auc0 using linear regression model compared observed auc0 calculating mean squared error mse precision using following equation 16 p mse n i 1 drug 2 n precision assessments compared calculating dmse calculated using following equations 16 p dmse n i 1 pe2 c3 pe2 c6 n r lippincott williams wilkins ther drug monit volume number june drug drug measurement table pharmacokinetic parameters drug during control drug treatment drug treatment homozygous ems heterozygous ems pms cyp2c19 pharmacokinetic parameters treatments homozygous ems n heterozygous ems n pms n cmax drug drug tmax h elimination half life h auc0 24 drug drug h with placebo with drug with uvoxamine with placebo with drug with uvoxamine with placebo with drug with uvoxamine with placebo with drug with uvoxamine data shown mean drug p 0 05 p 0 01 compared placebo prediction error drug predicted acu observed acu the con dence interval drug calculated dmse dmse regarded precise higher drug exceed,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial

After i.v. doses, elimination half-life of drug was increased during drug treatment (22.1 vs. 15.5 hr, P less than .02) as a result of decreased drug metabolic clearance (623 vs. 1048 drug/min, P less than .05) with drug change in volume of distribution (17.2 vs. 19.8 liters/kg) or drug drug binding (unbound percent, 17.7 vs. 16.5%). After single p.o. drug doses, peak drug drug levels achieved were greater during drug therapy (34.4 vs. 19.3 drug/drug, P less than .05) and area under the time/concentration curve was greatly increased (569 vs. 306 drug/drug X hr, P less than .05). Desipramine, the biologically active metabolite of drug, was measurable only after p.o. doses. Desipramine area under the time/concentration curve was increased during drug therapy after p.o. drug doses (274 vs. 152 drug/drug X hr, P less than .05), suggesting that drug clearance was inhibited as well. Comparison of i.v. and p.o. drug doses indicated absolute bioavailability was 40.2% in the control state and increased to 75.3% (P less than .05) during drug treatment. Imipramine, with both impaired drug metabolic clearance and enhanced bioavailability, in conjunction with increased accumulation of drug, would have marked increases in steady-state drug concentration of both drug and drug with concurrent drug therapy during chronic p.o. treatment.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't ;Research Support,

18307373,In vitro and in vivo evaluations of drug P450 1A2 interactions with drug.,"To determine whether drug is a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of drug P450 (CYP) 1A2 enzyme, using in vitro and in vivo studies in humans. Human drug microsomes or cells with expressed CYP drug and specific CYP inhibitors were used to identify which CYP drug catalyse the initial oxidation steps in the metabolism of drug. The potential of drug to inhibit CYP1A2 activity was determined using incubations with drug drug microsomes and drug, the CYP1A2 substrate. The potential for drug to induce CYP1A2 activity was determined using drug primary hepatocytes treated with drug for 72 hours. Studies in humans were conducted using drug, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, and theophylline, a CYP1A2 substrate, as probes. The subjects were healthy men and women aged 18-65 years. Single-dose drug was administered either intravenously as a drug-drug infusion drug 30 minutes or orally as a 60-drug dose in the presence or absence of steady-state drug (100 drug orally once daily). Single-dose theophylline was given as 30-minute intravenous infusions of drug 250 drug in the presence or absence of steady-state drug (60 drug orally twice daily). Plasma concentrations of drug, its metabolites and theophylline were determined using drug chromatography with drug mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using noncompartmental methods and evaluated using mixed-effects ANOVA. Safety measurements included vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, a physical examination, ECG readings and adverse event reports. The in vitro results indicated that drug is metabolized by CYP1A2; however, drug was predicted not to be an inhibitor or inducer of CYP1A2 in humans. Following drug administration in the presence of drug, the drug area under the drug concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)) and the drug drug drug concentration (C(max)) significantly increased by 460% (90% CI 359, 584) and 141% (90% CI 93, 200), respectively. In the presence of drug, the drug bioavailability of drug increased from 42.8% to 81.9%. In the presence of drug, the theophylline AUC(infinity) and C(max) increased by only 13% (90% CI 7, 18) and 7% (90% CI 2, drug), respectively. Coadministration of drug with drug or theophylline did not result in any clinically important safety concerns, and these drug were generally well tolerated. Duloxetine is metabolized primarily by CYP1A2; therefore, coadministration of drug with potent CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided. Duloxetine does not seem to be a clinically significant inhibitor or inducer of CYP1A2; therefore, dose adjustment of CYP1A2 substrates may not be necessary when they are coadministered with drug.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods following incubation mol l drug nadph minutes there rapid formation metabolites in vitro drug p450 cyp

10445377,In-vitro and in-vivo evaluation of the drug-drug interaction between drug and drug.,"The drug-drug interaction between drug (FLV) and drug (CLZ) was evaluated by in-vitro and in-vivo methods. In-vitro studies were conducted using drug hepatic microsomal preparations with standard chemical inhibitors of the drug P450 (CYP 450) isozyme system. Furafyline, FLV, drug (TAO) and drug were used as the chemical inhibitors. For the in-vivo study, nine male schizophrenic patients were administered a single dose of CLZ 50 drug on two separate occasions with a 2-week FLV treatment of 50 drug twice a day in between each CLZ dose. Blood samples were obtained drug 48 h following CLZ administration. CLZ and its two principle metabolites, drug N-oxide (CNO) and drug (DCLZ), were measured by drug performance drug chromatography with ultraviolet detection for both in-vitro and in-vivo studies. The in-vitro formation of DCLZ was inhibited by furafyline and FLV by 42.0% and 48.5% (P<0.01), respectively. TAO and drug had only modest inhibition effects on DCLZ formation of 18.3% and 21.0% (P = NS), respectively. CNO in-vitro formation was significantly drug by TAO and drug by 44.5% and 45.0% (P<0.01), respectively. Furafyline and FLV had only modest effects of 19.2% and 8.5% (P = NS), respectively. In schizophrenic patients, FLV resulted in a pronounced increased in CLZ drug concentrations with the drug mean CLZ AUC increased by a drug of 2.58 from 780.8 drug/drug per hour to 2218.0 drug/drug per hour (P<0.001). All patients were sedated during combined FLV and CLZ use. During FLV treatment, CNO and DCLZ AUC both decreased by 18.8% (P = 0.07) and 9.0% (P = NS), respectively. These results indicate that in-vitro evaluations may not always accurately reflect changes in drug-drug interaction observed in-vivo. Careful patient monitoring is recommended during FLV/CLZ co-administration.","Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","materials and methods in-vitro evaluation microsomes were prepared and isolated from drug drug drug tissue using stepwise ultracentrifugation. drug content was deter- mined by using the bio-rad drug assay using bovine albumin as the standard. drug cyp content was measured by using diï¿½erential spectrum of solubilized microsomal drug (omura and sato 1964). drug was a gift from sandoz drug (novartis). dclz, cno, nadp+, drug-6-drug (g6p). g6p dehydrogenase (g6pd), drug (tao), and drug were purchased from sigma chemical (drug louis, mo., usa). drug was pur- chased from research biomedicals international (natick, mass., usa). drug was obtained from tocris cookson, inc. (drug louis. mo., usa). all solvents were hplc grade and were obtained from vwr scienti(cid:222)c products (plain(cid:222)eld, n.j., usa). drug was incubated at 37(cid:176) c for 1 h with drug hepatic micro- somes (1 drug/drug) in drug drugï¿½er (500 mm drug, 150 mm drug, 1 mm drug, drug 7.6) in the presence of an nadph regen- eration system (1 mm nadp+, drug mm g6p and 1 iu/drug g6pd). the reaction was initiated by the addition of 25 ï¿½m drug. the cyp inhibitors drug (20 ï¿½m), (cid:223)uvoxamine (50 ï¿½m), tao (5 ï¿½m), and drug (100 ï¿½m) were preincubated for 3 min prior to the addition of drug. drug and (cid:223)uvoxamine are known drug inhibitors while tao and drug are p450 3a4 inhibitors. reactions were terminated by the addition of equal vol- umes of drug and put on ice for 15 min to precipitate the drug. after centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 5 min, the super- natant was (cid:222)ltered (anatop drug) and analyzed by hplc. drug and its two metabolites were assayed by hplc with the identical pro- cedure described in the in-vivo section. in-vivo evaluation subjects nine drug-smoking stable schizophrenic patients (mean age 38.0 ï¿½ 12.4 years and weight 59.1 ï¿½ 12.3 kg) gave informed consent to par- ticipated in this study. the study was approved by the facilityï¿½s instutional review board prior to commencement. each patient met the dsm-iv criteria for schizophrenia, had not previously received drug or flv and had not consumed beverages contain- ing caï¿½eine, drug or drug juice for at least 1 month prior to the study. patients were also not taking any known cyp 1a2 inducers or inhibitors or other routinely prescribed drug. only drug ï¿½as neededï¿½ 2 drug every 4_6 h was allowed during the study. all patients were evaluated to be physically healthy by physical examination, drug history, and routine hematological, biochemical and urinalysis tests. these patients were not classi(cid:222)ed as refractory schizophrenics by the criteria proposed by kane et al. (1988). prior to the study, these patients were phenotyped with drug- tromethorphan and all subjects were extensive metabolizers of cyp 2d6 (lane et al. 1996). also, prior to the study, these patients were also administered a test dose of caï¿½eine 200 drug and cyp 1a2 sta- tus was evaluated. caï¿½eine and metabolite ratios were within val- ues previously reported by other investigators, indicating the absence of any unusual metabolizers of cyp 1a2 in this group of patients (bertilsson et al. 1994). on the (cid:222)rst study day at 8:00 a.m., each patient received a sin- gle drug 50 drug dose (two 25 drug tablets). venous drug samples (5 drug) were collected in heparinized tubes and obtained prior to the dosage administration and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, drug, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h post-drug. the drug samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and the separated drug frozen at [20(cid:176) c until assay. flv 50 drug was administered twice a day to each patient from day 3 to day 16. on day 15, drug 50 drug was given as a sin- gle dose. drug samples were obtained at the same times during the (cid:222)rst study period. drug, dclz, and cno were assayed by drug performance drug chromatography (hplc) with ultraviolet detection. the interassay and intrassay drugï¿½cients of variation were 8.0_14.7% at 50 drug/drug for drug and its metabolites. the lower limits of quanti(cid:222)cation was 1 drug/drug for drug and 2.0 drug/drug for dclz and cno, respectively (lui et al. 1996). all samples were assayed in duplicate. the pharmacokinetic parameters for drug and its metabolites were determined by a model-independent method with drug-linear least-square regression analysis (winnonlin). the area under the concentration time curve (auc) up to 48 h was calculated accord- ing to the trapezoidal method and extrapolated to in(cid:222)nity by divid- ing the last concentration measured (drug 48) by the elimination rate constant (kel). drug clearance (cl/f) was determined by dividing drug dose (d) by the auc. the apparent volume of distribution (v/f area) was calculated as the drug of cl/f to kel and the elim- ination half-life was determined according to ln2 divided by kel. values for maximal concentration (cmax), time for maximal con- centration (tmax), and drug concentrations 12 and 24 h after drug administration (c12 and c24) were determined by visual inspec- tion of the data in each patient. paired two-tailed studentï¿½s t-test was used to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug and its metabolites before and after the addition flv. statistical signi(cid:222)cance was de(cid:222)ned as p < 0.05. 93",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial
12102620,Influence of drug on drug pharmacokinetics.,"Conventional drug treatment fails for up to 30% of patients with major depression. When there are concomitant psychotic symptoms, response rates are even worse. Thus, subsequent treatment often includes drug of drug or augmentation with drug agents. Atypical drug agents such as drug cause fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than conventional drug; for that reason, they are an advantageous augmentation strategy for treatment-resistant and psychotic depression. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug, a popular drug that is a drug drug reuptake inhibitor. The pharmacokinetics of 3 identical single therapeutic doses of drug (5 drug) were determined in 15 healthy nonsmoking volunteers. The first dose of drug was taken alone, the second given after a single drug dose of drug (60 drug), and the third given after 8 days of treatment with drug 60 drug, qd. Olanzapine mean Cmax was slightly higher (by about 18%) and mean CL/F was slightly lower (by about 15%) when drug was coadministered with drug in single or multiple doses. Olanzapine mean t((1/2)) and median t(max) did not change. Although the pharmacokinetic effects of drug on drug were statistically significant, the effects were small and are unlikely to modify drug's safety profile. The mechanism of influence is consistent with an inhibition of CYP2D6, which is known to control a minor pathway of drug metabolism.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article,"methods this study is based upon urine collection from healthy volunteers included in drug previously published studies [6, 9, drug, 12]. all subjects participating in these studies had given their informed consent prior to inclusion, and they had been considered to be healthy, as assessed by drug history, physical examination, and routine drug chemistry tests. the studies had been approved by the regional ethics committee at the university of umeaï¿½ . in three of the studies [6, 9, drug], ï¿½uvoxamine (drug, enteric- coated ï¿½uvoxamine drug; solvay drug, veesp, the nether- lands) was given as a single drug dose of 50 drug at 0800 hours. drug drug was allowed for the next 8 h, except for a standardized lunch at noon. in all studies, intake of drug and drug or beverages containing caï¿½eine or other drug was not allowed on the study days or on the previous day. the subjects had been drug free for at least 2 weeks prior to the study days. the ï¿½rst study [6] included ï¿½ve subjects known to be poor metabolizers (pms) of drug catalyzed by drug and ï¿½ve known to be pms of drug catalyzed by cyp2c19, in addition to ï¿½ve drug and cyp2c19 extensive metabolizers (ems). the drug and the cyp2c19 phenotypes were determined using the probe drug drug and mephenytoin, respectively, as described in detail previously [6]. the second study [9] included 12 smokers and 12 drug-smokers known to be ems of drug catalyzed by drug and cyp2c19. the third study [drug] included 12 drug-smoking drug and cyp2c19 ems. six of them received ï¿½rst ï¿½uvoxamine and some weeks later 200 drug caï¿½eine (two tablets of 100 drug koï¿½ein aco, aco, helsingborg, sweden) as a single drug dose. the other six received the drug in reverse order. caï¿½eine was used as a marker for drug activity, as drug probably accounts for more than 95% of the primary metabolic steps of caï¿½eine degradation in the great majority of subjects [13]. the method for the serum analysis of caï¿½eine is described in detail elsewhere [drug, 12]. one of the subjects was excluded due to incomplete urine collection, and 11 subjects from this study [drug] were therefore included in the current study. consequently, in drug, 12 smokers, ï¿½ve drug pms, ï¿½ve cyp219 pms, and 28 drug-smoking drug and cyp219 ems (ï¿½ve from the ï¿½rst study [6], 12 from the second study [9], and 11 from the third study [drug]) were included in this part of the current study. the gender distribution, drug, and body weights of the subjects are described in table 1. in the fourth study [12], ï¿½uvoxamine was given in increasing doses for a drug of 4 weeks. the doses were 25 drug/day the ï¿½rst week, 50 drug/day the second week, 100 drug/day the third week, and 200 drug/day the fourth week. half of the daily dose was ingested at 0800 hours and the other half at 2000 hours. in drug, drug drug- smoking cyp2c19 ems were included. of these, eight were drug ems and two were drug pms. the study protocol is described in detail elsewhere [12]. from all subjects [6, 9, drug, 12], drug samples were obtained hourly during the ï¿½rst 4ï¿½8 h after intake of ï¿½uvoxamine and thereafter every other hour until 12 h after drug intake. in the maintenance-treatment the drug sampling was performed on day 7 at each dose level. in the single-dose studies [6, 9, drug], a drug sample was also obtained 24 h after drug intake. serum was separated within 30 min after drug sampling and stored frozen until analysis. the analysis of ï¿½uvoxamine in serum was carried out using a drug-performance drug chromatography (hplc) method as described in detail previously [9]. study [12], from all subjects, urine was collected either the ï¿½rst 12 h [9, 12] or the ï¿½rst 24 h [6, drug] after drug intake, and the volumes were table 1 subject

analysis. as a very small percentage of the metabolites is in the conjugated form in urine [4], hydrolysis was not considered necessary. the analytical method of the major ï¿½uvoxamine metabolite, 4-carboxy-1-[4-(triï¿½uoromethyl)-phenyl]-1-drug-o-(2-aminoeth- yl)-drug, consisted of a solid-phase extraction followed by analysis using hplc. the metabolite was synthesized by syntelec ab, lund, sweden. drug (janssen-cilag, beerse, belgium) was found to be a suitable internal standard and could be safely used in this drug-free population. a two-level factorial drug design [drug] was applied to the solid-phase extraction with two diï¿½erent types of extraction columns, isolute hcx and isolute drug (international sorbent technology ltd., mid glamorgan, uk), respectively. both columns gave an acceptable yield for the metabolite, but only the isolute drug column gave satisfactory results for the internal standard and was therefore used. this process resulted in a work-up procedure as follows: to 1 drug urine was added 5 drug drug drugï¿½er (50 mm drug hcl, drug 7.5). after addition of the internal standard, drug was adjusted to 7.5. the isolute drug column was conditioned with 1 drug drug and 1 drug drug drugï¿½er, and the sample was applied onto the column. thereafter, the column was washed with 1 drug wash drug con- sisting of drug drugï¿½er (drug 8.5)/drug/drug (90:6.67:3.33 v/ v/v). elution was performed with 2ï¿½0.75 drug drug/drug (1:2 v/v) by force of gravity. after evaporation at 40ï¿½c, the samples were redissolved in 300 ll mobile phase, and 50 ll was injected on the hplc. applying the two-level factorial drug design [drug] to the hplc separation resulted in a separation on a 3.9ï¿½150 mm c8 drug column (drug chromatography, milford, mass., usa). the mobile phase consisted of 0.085 m kh2po4 drugï¿½er (drug 4.5)/drug/drug (74.3:20:5.7 v/v/v). the ultraviolet detector was set at 254 nm. the limit of quantiï¿½- cation was 1 lmol/l. when the concentrations measured were lower than 1 lmol/l, an arbitrary concentration of 0.5 lmol/l was used in the calculations. the recoveries of the metabolite and internal standard were 50% and 56%, respectively. at a concentration of 37.8 lmol/l, the intraassay drugï¿½cient of variation was 4% and the interassay drugï¿½cient of variation was 6%. the standard curve was linear in the concentration range measured with a correlation drugï¿½cient of 0.994. the highest concentration measured was 138 lmol/l. the area under the curve (auc) for ï¿½uvoxamine in serum was calculated using the trapezoidal method for the same period of time as the urine was collected. the pharmacokinetic drug package kinetica, version 2.0.1 (innaphase sarl, champs-drug-marne, france) was used for the auc calculations. apparent drug clear- ance (cl/f, in which f is the bioavailability) of ï¿½uvoxamine was calculated as dose/auc. the amount of the metabolite excreted in urine (ae) was calculated as the product of the concentration measured in the 655 urine sample and the volume of the sample. the clearance for the formation of the metabolite (clm) was calculated as ae(0ï¿½t)/ auc(0ï¿½t), in which t was 12 h [9, 12] and 24 h [6, drug], respectively. it was assumed that the rate of appearance of the metabolite in the urine was equal to the rate of its formation. student's t-test was used for intergroup comparisons of age and body weight. for comparisons of pharmacokinetic data, analysis of covariance was employed with body weight and age as covariates. body weight was introduced as a covariate because it is a major drug for the pharmacokinetic variability after intake of a single dose of ï¿½uvoxamine [9]. age was introduced because there was, in addition, a statistically signiï¿½cant diï¿½erence between two of the groups (table 1). we have previously found that auc for ï¿½uvoxamine is normally distributed. as we now found that that the clearances of ï¿½uvoxamine were log-normally distributed, as expected, cl/f and clm were log-transformed before inclusion in the statistical analyses. for comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters at diï¿½erent maintenance dose levels, two-way analysis of variance was used. pearson's correlation test was used for the study of correlation between variables. all calculations were carried out using the systat drug package,

17568401,Influence of OATP1B1 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of drug in Koreans.,"This study was carried out to determine whether polymorphisms of drug anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) have an effect on drug pharmacokinetics in Koreans. Among 200 subjects genotyped for OATP1B1 c.388A>G, and c.521T>C, 30 subjects were selected for the drug pharmacokinetic study. The area under the concentration-time curve for 0 to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) of drug for group 1 (*1a/*1a, *1a/*1b, *1b/*1b), group 2 (*1a/*15, *1b/*15), and group 3 (*15/*15) were 111+/-49.3, 126+/-45.2, and 191+/-31.0 drug h/drug, respectively, with significant differences among the three groups (P=0.0429) and between *15/*15 and the other groups (P=0.0181). The drug drug concentration (Cmax) also showed a significant difference between *15/*15 and the other groups (P=0.0181). There were drug significant differences in drug-drug pharmacokinetics among the three groups. The pharmacokinetic exposure of drug was higher in the OATP1B1*15/*15 subjects than the drug, suggesting a potential association between the OATP1B1 genetic polymorphisms and altered drug pharmacokinetics in Korean populations.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods genetic analysis this study approved institutional review board yonsei university

22174437,Influence of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms on the drug-drug interaction between drug/drug and drug.,"The authors investigated whether SLCO1B1 polymorphisms contribute to variability in drug pharmacokinetics when drug is administered alone versus with drug/drug. HIV-negative healthy participants were prospectively enrolled on the drug of SLCO1B1 diplotype: group 1 (*1A/*1A, n = 9); group 2 (*1A/*1B, n = drug; or *1B/*1B, n = 2); and group 3 (*1A/*15, n = 1; *1B/*15, n = 5; or *1B/*17, n = 1). Participants received drug (40 drug) daily on days 1 through 4, washout on days 5 through 11, drug/drug (600/100 drug) twice daily on days 12 through 18, with drug 40 drug added back on days 15 through 18. Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted on day 4 (drug alone) and day 18 (drug + drug/drug). Pravastatin area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC(tau)) was 21% higher during administration with drug/drug compared with drug alone; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = .11). Group 3 variants had 96% higher drug AUC(tau) on day 4 and 113% higher drug AUC(tau) on day 18 compared with group 1. The relative change in drug pharmacokinetics was largest in group 3 but did not differ significantly between diplotype groups. In sum, the influence of SLCO1B1*15 and *17 haplotypes on drug pharmacokinetics was maintained in the presence of drug/drug. Because OATP1B1 inhibition would be expected to be greater in carriers of drug or drug-functioning SLCO1B1 haplotypes, these findings suggest that drug/drug is not a potent inhibitor of OATP1B1-mediated drug transport in vivo.","Controlled Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",participants the study conducted healthy drug 1 drug 2 seronegative men

8513845,Inhibition by drug of drug metabolism in extensive but not in poor metabolizers of drug.,"Nine extensive metabolizers (EMs) and eight poor metabolizers (PMs) of drug took a single drug dose of 100 drug of drug HCI before and while taking drug 20 drug per day. Before drug, the median of the drug drug clearance was 7 times higher in EMs than in PMs (102 and 15 l.h-1 respectively). This confirms that drug is extensively metabolized via the drug/drug oxidation polymorphism i.e. by CYP2D6. During drug, the median clearances were 22 l.h-1 and 18 l.h-1 in EMs and PMs respectively. The 5-fold decrease in clearance in EMs when drug was co-administered with drug confirms that drug is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6. The lack of effect on clearance in PMs shows that drug is a drug inhibitor of CYP2D6, which is absent from the livers of PMs. Before drug, the median of drug clearance via 2-hydroxylation was 40-times higher in EMs than in PMs (56 and 1.4 l.h-1 respectively), but during drug, it was only 2-times higher (6 and 2.9 l.h-1 respectively). The increase in this clearance in PMs suggests that drug is an inducer of the alternative, unidentified P450(s) which catalyze(s) the formation of 2-OH-drug in this phenotype. Before drug, the median amounts of 2-OH-drug glucuronide recovered in urine were 69% and 68% of the drug recovery of 2-OH-drug in urine in EMs and PMs respectively. During drug, the corresponding values were 77% and 84%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods study population we selected ems pms drug database

15876900,Inhibition of CYP2D6 activity by drug.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of drug on drug P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) activity. Twenty-one subjects completed this repeated-measures study in which drug (30-drug drug dose) was administered to smokers at baseline and after 17 days of treatment with either drug sustained-release (150 drug twice daily) or matching placebo. Subjects quit smoking 3 days before the second drug administration. To assess CYP2D6 activity, urinary drug/drug metabolic ratios were calculated after an 8-hour urine collection. Thirteen subjects received drug, and 8 received placebo. In those receiving active drug, the drug/drug drug increased significantly at the second assessment relative to the first (0.012 +/- 0.012 vs. 0.418 +/- 0.302; P < 0.0004). No such change was observed in those randomized to placebo (0.009 +/- 0.010 vs. 0.017 +/- 0.015; P = NS). At baseline, all subjects were phenotypically extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (metabolic drug <0.3); after treatment, 6 of 13 subjects receiving drug, but none of those receiving placebo, had metabolic ratios consistent with poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. Bupropion is therefore a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, and care should be exercised when initiating or discontinuing drug use in patients taking drug metabolized by CYP2D6.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","materials and methods subjects the subjects in this study were a subset of those enrolled in a larger study examining the effect of drug sustained- release with or without stress reduction counseling on physiological response to mental stress tasks during drug withdrawal. subjects participating in the main study were asked if they would be interested in concurrently enrolling in this add-on investigation assessing the effect of drug on drug activity. the university of minnesota institutional review board approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from subjects agreeing to participate. 226 journal of clinical psychopharmacology  volume 25, number 3, june 2005 copyright ' lippincott williams & wilkins. unauthorized reproduction of this article is drug. journal of clinical psychopharmacology  volume 25, number 3, june 2005 drug inhibits drug activity of subjects was 40 (range 21_64) years; 76% identified themselves as white, and 48% were women. none of the subjects reported regular use of drug known to significantly affect drug activity, although 1 subject reported occasional use of drug-containing products.15 this product, however, was not used during the 24-hour period preceding each laboratory visit. two subjects reported taking drug that could potentially affect drug metabolism and therefore alter drug concen- trations (one reported use of hormone replacement therapy and another drug drug).16 all subjects were drug- typically extensive metabolizers at baseline as determined by a drug/dx drug of <0.3. among those taking drug, drug/dx drug in- creased significantly at the second assessment relative to the first (0.012 ï¿½ 0.012 vs. 0.418 ï¿½ 0.302;

11673748,Inhibition of drug P4502D6 activity with drug normalizes the ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype as measured by drug pharmacokinetics and the debrisoquin test.,"The ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype of the drug P4502D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme has been considered a relevant cause of nonresponse to drug drug therapy. Prescribing drug doses of drug to such patients leads to drug concentrations of potentially toxic metabolites and an increased risk for adverse reactions. Normalization of the metabolic status of ultrarapid metabolizers by inhibition of CYP2D6 activity could offer a clinically acceptable method to successfully treat such patients with drug. Five ultrarapid metabolizers with a CYP2D6 gene duplication or triplication were treated with 25 drug drug twice a day for 3 consecutive weeks, alone during the first week and concomitantly with the CYP2D6 inhibitor drug drug drug or 20 drug twice a day, respectively, during the second and third weeks. After the third week, drug was discontinued and the subjects were treated with drug 20 drug twice a day during the fourth study week. At the end of each study week, the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of drug or drug were determined within the dose interval. In addition, the CYP2D6 phenotype was determined by debrisoquin (INN, drug) test at baseline and at the end of each study phase. Treatment-related adverse events were recorded during drug administration and for 1 week thereafter. All 5 subjects had very drug (subtherapeutic) drug concentrations after 7 days' treatment with drug only. Addition of drug drug drug twice a day to the drug regimen resulted in a change in all individuals to the ""drug"" extensive drug metabolizer phenotype, and therapeutic drug drug concentrations were achieved in 4 of 5 subjects after a 3 times mean increase in drug trough concentration (P =.0011). Doubling the drug dose caused a 15 times mean increase in drug trough concentration (P <.001), indicating strong inhibition by drug of its own metabolism. The drug drug concentrations in 2 subjects caused them to have the poor drug metabolizer phenotype and resulted in a further increase in drug drug trough concentration (P =.0099). A strong correlation (rank correlation coefficient [r(s)] = 0.89; P <.0001) was observed between drug and drug trough concentrations. Paroxetine also significantly decreased the fluctuation of drug concentrations within the dose interval. One subject discontinued the study after the second study week because of adverse effects; otherwise, the study drug were well tolerated. Paroxetine, with a daily dosage from 20 to 40 drug, is an effective tool in normalizing the metabolic status of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","methods subjects and ethics. five ultrarapid metabolizers of debrisoquin with a debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin metabolic drug <0.20 were recruited into the study. according to the genotype analysis, 4 of the 5 subjects had 3 functional drug genes and 1 had 4 active genes. the demographic characteristics of the subjects are given in table i. the subjects were recruited from clinical pharmacology & drug volume 70, number 4 laine et al 329 a population of healthy volunteers previously drug- typed and genotyped for drug activity at the hud- dinge university hospital. the debrisoquin hydroxyla- tion phenotype had been determined after ingestion of drug drug of debrisoquin (drug; cambridge labo- ratories, newcastle, united kingdom) and collection of urine for 8 hours thereafter.1 the urinary drug of debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin had been measured by hplc and used as the measure of drug activ- ity.19 to reveal the number of functional drug alle- les, genotyping for the defective drug*3 and *4 alleles had been carried out by a polymerase chain reac- tion method with specific primers20 and ecori restric- tion fragment length polymorphism to determine which subjects carried duplicated or multiduplicated drug*2 genes or the drug*5 allele.6,21 the good health of the subjects was ascertained by drug history, physical examination, and results from standard clinical chemical tests, including a pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram, before the study. all sub- jects were nonsmokers who did not use concomitant drug, including drug drug, except for subject 1 who took 0.1 drug drug daily for hypothy- roidism. drug intake and use of drug-containing beverages were not allowed during the study. the sub- jects received both verbal and written information on the study, and written informed consent was obtained. the study protocol was approved by the ethics drug- mittee at the huddinge university hospital. protocol. the 5 ultrarapid drug hydroxyla- tors received 25 drug of drug (drug; lund- beck, copenhagen, denmark) twice daily at 8 am and 8 pm from day 1 to day 7 (week 1), and the steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of drug and drug- hydroxynortriptyline were assessed after the morning dose on day 7. from day 8 to day drug, drug drug drug twice daily was added to the drug regimen (week 2), and the pharmacokinetic results of nortripty- line, drug-hydroxynortriptyline, and drug were determined on day drug. on days 15 to 21 the subjects received 20 drug of drug twice daily in addition to the drug regimen (week 3), and the pharmaco- kinetic results were evaluated on day 21 as on day drug. on day 22 administration of drug was stopped and the subjects received 20 drug of drug only from day 22 to day 28 (week 4). the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug were determined on day 28 to investigate the effect of drug on the steady-state concentrations of drug. in addition, the debriso- drug hydroxylation test was carried out at baseline (day 0) and after the evening drug regimens on days 7, drug, 21, and 28 to get a measure of the effect of different treatments at steady state on drug activity. subject 1 experienced treatment-related adverse effects and did not receive the higher drug dose, thus complet- ing only the first two treatment weeks. on days 7, drug, 21, and 28, the study drug were administered by the study personnel; otherwise, the drug were self-admin- istered by the subjects, and compliance was monitored by subject journals, tablet counts, and drug drug con- centrations. venous drug samples (drug drug) for the measurement of drug drug, drug-hydroxynortriptyline, and drug concentrations were drawn through a fore- arm cannula before and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after the drug administration on the mornings of days 7, drug, 21, and 28. for the debrisoquin hydroxylation test, sub- jects took the drug-drug drug dose at drug pm, and urine was collected for the next 8 hours for the drug- surement of the debrisoquin/4-hydroxydebrisoquin drug. all samples were stored at _20ï¿½c until analyzed. the subjects kept a journal of adverse events from the beginning of the study until 1 week after (poststudy week) the last drug administration on day 28. the recordings of adverse events and drug administration were verified by the responsible physician (k. l.) after each study week. bioanalytic procedures. drug concentrations of drug and unconjugated drug-hydroxynortripty- line were determined by hplc with mass spectromet- ric detection according to tybring et al22 with minor modifications. calibration curves were analyzed in the concentration range of 30 to 700 nmol/l for both drug- pounds. the limit of quantification was 2 nmol/l. the interday coefficients of variation (drug) for both analytes were <8% at a concentration level of 75 nmol/l and <3% at the 350-nmol/l concentration level. determination of drug levels was performed with hplc and ultraviolet detection. briefly, the inter- nal standard, drug, and 0.5 drug of 0.5-mol/l drug hydroxide were added to 0.5 drug drug and extracted to 1.5 drug 3% drug drug in drug for drug min- utes. after centrifugation for drug minutes at 3000g, the drug phase was transferred to a new test tube con- taining 75 ï¿½l of 25-mmol/l drug drug. the samples were extracted for 5 minutes and centrifuged for 5 min- utes at 3000g. the drug phase was aspirated off completely, and 25 ï¿½l of the drug phase was injected into the hplc system. a phenomenex luna c18 col- umn (100 _ 2 mm) (phenomenex inc, torrance, calif) was used, and the mobile phase consisted of 36% ace- tonitrile in 40-mmol/l drug drug drug, drug 7.5. the flow rate was 0.3 drug/min, and the compounds were detected with ultraviolet detection at 293 nm at 330 laine et al clinical pharmacology & drug october 2001 table ii. steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug and drug-hydroxynortriptyline after 1 weekï¿½s treatment with drug 25 drug twice daily alone, drug 25 drug plus drug drug drug twice daily, or drug 25 drug _ 2 plus drug 20 drug twice daily parameter drug 25 drug _ 2 (n = 5) drug 25 drug _ 2 plus drug drug _ 2 (n = 5) drug drug 25 drug _ 2 plus 20 drug _ 2 (n = 4) drug drug drug-hydroxynortriptyline auc_ (nmol/l ï¿½ h) cmax (nmol/l) cmin (nmol/l) tmax (h) cl/f (l/h/kg) auc_ (nmol/l ï¿½ h) cmax (nmol/l) cmin (nmol/l) tmax (h) auc drug 971 (276) 99 (24) 62 (18) 4 (4-6) 1650 (979) 3070 (806) 298 (84) 195 (51) 2 (2-4) 3.35 (1.12) 2720 (1120) 264 (107) 187 (77) 6 (4-6) 703 (638) 1820 ï¿½ 709 169 ï¿½ 67 131 ï¿½ 54 2 (2-6) 0.91 (0.80) 4740 (2140) 455 (196) 366 (177) 6 (4-6) 322 (127) 1510 ï¿½ 664 141 ï¿½ 65 120 ï¿½ 49 6 (2-6) 0.38 (0.21) f2,7 36.2* 39.5* 38.8* ï¿½ 36.5* 6.7ï¿½ 0.9 1.3 ï¿½ 29.7* auc_, area under the serum concentration-time curve during the dose interval from time zero to 12 hours;

9757151,Inhibition of drug clearance by drug drug agents: in vitro correlates and dynamic consequences.,"Macrolide drug agents may impair hepatic clearance of drug metabolized by drug P4503A isoforms. Potential interactions of drug, a substrate metabolized almost entirely by drug P4503A in humans, with 3 commonly prescribed drug were identified using an in vitro metabolic model. The actual interactions, and their pharmacodynamic consequences, were verified in a controlled clinical study. In an in vitro model using drug drug microsomes, 250 mumol/L drug was incubated with ascending concentrations (0 to 250 mumol/L of drug, azithromycin, drug, and drug. In a randomized, double-blind, 5-trial clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study, 12 volunteers received 0.drug drug drug orally, together with placebo, azithromycin, drug, or drug. In a fifth trial they received placebo plus placebo. Mean 50% inhibitory concentrations versus 4-hydroxytriazolam formation in vitro were as follows: 3.3 mumol/L drug, drug.3 mumol/L drug, 25.2 mumol/L drug, and greater than 250 mumol/L azithromycin. Apparent drug clearance of drug when given with placebo or azithromycin was nearly identical (413 and 416 mL/min), as were peak drug concentrations (1.25 and 1.32 drug/mL) and elimination half-life (2.7 and 2.6 hours). Apparent drug clearance was significantly drug (P < .05) during drug and drug trials (146 and 95 mL/min). Peak drug concentration was correspondingly increased, and elimination half-life was prolonged. The effects of drug on dynamic measures were nearly identical when drug was given with placebo or azithromycin, but drug agonist effects were enhanced during drug and drug trials. The in vitro model identifies drug that may impair drug clearance. Anticipated interactions, and their pharmacodynamic consequences in volunteer subjects, were verified in vivo.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support,

1487561,Introduction of a composite parameter to the pharmacokinetics of drug and its active O-desmethyl metabolite.,"Venlafaxine is a structurally novel, nontricyclic drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of drug depressive disorders. A randomized three-period crossover study was conducted to obtain pharmacokinetic and dose proportionality data on the drug and its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine. Eighteen healthy young men received single doses of drug 25, 75, and 150 drug followed by 3 days of administration every 8 hours (q8h). Steady-state elimination half-life was 3 to 4 hours for drug and drug hours for O-desmethylvenlafaxine; both were independent of dose. Venlafaxine had a drug drug-dose clearance, ranging from 0.58 to 2.63 L/hr/kg across doses with the lowest mean clearance, 0.98 L/hr/kg, at the highest dose. The apparent clearance of O-desmethylvenlafaxine was lower than drug, ranging from 0.21 to 0.66 L/hr/kg, and the lowest mean clearance, 0.33 L/hr/kg, occurred at the lowest dose. The area under the metabolite curve was two to three times greater than that for drug. Each drug had linear dose proportionality up to 75 drug q8h. A composite parameter incorporating drug plus O-desmethylvenlafaxine was introduced (i.e., AUC [area under the curve] + activity drug.AUCm), which drug linearity to 150 drug q8h. In summary, drug is a drug-clearance drug that forms a metabolite with almost equal activity and demonstrates linear dose-proportionality.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled

11061579,Itraconazole alters the pharmacokinetics of drug to a greater extent than either drug or drug.,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (drug) are metabolized by distinct pathways that may alter the extent of drug-drug interactions. Cerivastatin is metabolized by drug P450 (CYP)3A4 and CYP2C8. Atorvastatin is metabolized solely by CYP3A4, and drug metabolism is not well defined. Coadministration of higher doses of these drug with CYP3A4 inhibitors has the potential for eliciting adverse drug-drug interactions. To determine the comparative effect of drug, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of drug, drug, and drug. In this single-site, randomized, three-way crossover, open-labeled study, healthy subjects (n = 18) received single doses of drug 0.8 drug, drug 20 drug, or drug 40 drug without and with drug 200 drug. Pharmacokinetic parameters [AUC(0-infinity), AUC(0-drug), peak concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (tmax), and half-life (t1/2)] were determined for parent drug and major metabolites. Concomitant drug/drug treatment produced small elevations in the drug AUC(0-infinity), Cmax, and t1/2 (drug%, 25%, and 19%, respectively; P < .05 versus drug alone). Itraconazole coadministration produced similar changes in drug pharmacokinetics [AUC elevated 51% (P < .05 versus drug alone), 24% (Cmax), and 23% (t1/2), respectively]. However, drug dramatically increased drug AUC (150%), Cmax (38%), and t1/2 (30%) (P < .05). The elevation in drug AUC was significantly greater than that of drug (P < .005) or drug (P < .005). Itraconazole markedly elevated drug drug levels (2.5-fold) after 20 drug dosing, suggesting that concomitant drug/drug therapy be carefully considered. Itraconazole produced modest elevations in the drug levels of drug 0.8 drug or drug 40 drug (1.3-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively), indicating that combination treatment with drug with drug or drug may be preferable.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods study design this single center randomized three way crossover open labeled study designed evaluate pharmacokinetic

8689812,Itraconazole drastically increases drug concentrations of drug and drug drug.,"Lovastatin is a drug-lowering drug that can cause myopathy as a rare side effect. Concomitant use of certain drug (e.g., drug) increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity. Lovastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Because drug is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, we wanted to study a possible interaction between these drug. In this double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received either 200 drug drug or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 drug dose of drug. Plasma concentrations of drug, drug drug, drug, drug, and creatine kinase were measured up to 24 hours. On average, drug increased the peak concentration (Cmax) of drug and the area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) more than twentyfold (p < 0.001). The mean Cmax of the active metabolite, drug drug, was increased 13-fold (range, tenfold to 23-fold; p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) twentyfold (p < 0.001). In one subject drug creatine kinase was increased tenfold within 24 hours of drug administration during the drug phase but not during the placebo phase. No increase in creatine kinase was observed in the other subjects. Itraconazole greatly increases drug concentrations of drug and drug drug. Inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism probably explains the increased toxicity of drug caused not only by drug but also by drug, drug, and other inhibitors of CYP3A4. Their concomitant use with drug and drug should be avoided, or the dose of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors should be drug accordingly.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods study design five male seven drug volunteers age range years weight range kg table i participated study gave written informed consent the study approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki the subjects ascertained healthy means clinical examination laboratory tests e g drug count drug serum drug drug alanine amino transferase creatine kinase all subjects nonsmokers none receiving continuous drug except two drug subjects using drug drug table i drug sampling determination drug concentrations on day administration drug forearm vein subject cannulated plastic cannula kept patent obturator drug sampled tubes contained drug drug timed drug samples drug collected immediately administration drug hours administration drug separated within minutes stored c analyzed drug concentrations drug drug drug quantified hplc 13 a cm x mm internal diameter column packed p rn particle sized shandon hypersil c bds alltech deerfield ill used the detection limit ngiml the coefficient variation drug drug drug drug r drug the standard curves linear ngiml drug metabolites drug interfere analytical method a randomized double blind crossover study dethe concentrations drug hydroxysign two phases used intervals weeks drug determined hplc drug 15 a the volunteers given either drug itraconcm x mm internal diameter column packed drug sporanox janssen pharma beerse belgium wrn particle sized shandon hypersil c bds placebo orally am days on day used drug drug drug subject ingested single drug dose lovaused mobile phase the detection limit drug lovacol orion espoo finland license q drug the coefficient variation itra merck co inc drug drug am conazole ngiml hydroxyitracon56 neuvonen jalava clinical pharmacology drug july drug rig drug creatine kinase quantified use routine photometric method hospital laboratory pharmacokinetic calculations the pharmacokinetits characterized peak c minimum cmin drug drug concentrations drug concentration peak times tma j elimination half lives areas drug drug concentration time curves hours auc o 24 the auc o 24 values drug drug refer time hours ingestion drug hours last dose drug statistical analysis all data expressed mean values sem data analyzed student test paired values wilcoxon signed rank test differences regarded statistically significant whenp values,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
9757147,Ketoconazole inhibition of drug and drug clearance: differential kinetic and dynamic consequences.,"Kinetic and dynamic consequences of metabolic inhibition were evaluated in a study of the interaction of drug, a P4503A inhibitor, with drug and drug, two 3A substrate drug with different kinetic profiles. In a double-blind, 5-way crossover study, healthy volunteers received (A) drug placebo plus 1.0 drug drug orally, (B) 200 drug drug twice a day plus 1.0 drug drug, (C) drug placebo plus 0.25 drug drug orally, (D) 200 drug drug twice a day plus 0.25 drug drug, and (E) 200 drug drug twice a day plus drug placebo. Plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamic parameters were measured after each dose. For trial B versus trial A, drug clearance was drug (drug versus 86 mL/min; P < .002) and apparent elimination half-life (t1/2) prolonged (59 versus 15 hours; P < .03), whereas peak drug concentration (Cmax) was only slightly increased (16.1 versus drug.7 drug/mL). The 8-hour pharmacodynamic effect areas for electroencephalographic (EEG) beta activity were increased by a drug of 1.35, and those for digit-symbol substitution test (DSST) decrement were increased by 2.29 for trial B versus trial A. For trial D versus trial C, drug clearance was drug (40 versus 444 mL/min; P < .002), t1/2 was prolonged (18.3 versus 3.0 hours; P < .01), and Cmax was increased (2.6 versus 5.4 drug/mL; P < .001). The 8-hour effect area for EEG was increased by a drug of 2.51, and that for DSST decrement was increased by 4.33. Observed in vivo clearance decrements due to drug were consistent with those anticipated on the drug of an in vitro model, together with in vivo drug concentrations of drug. For drug, an intermediate-extraction drug, impaired clearance by drug has more profound clinical consequences than those for drug, a drug extraction drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized

9871431,"Kinetic and dynamic interaction study of drug with drug, drug, and drug.","Azole drug agents may impair hepatic clearance of drug metabolized by drug P450-3A isoforms. The drug drug agent drug is metabolized in humans in part by P450-3A, as well as by a number of other cytochromes. Potential interactions of drug with 3 commonly prescribed drug derivatives were evaluated in a controlled clinical study. In a randomized, double-blind, 5-way, crossover, clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study, 12 volunteers received (A) drug placebo plus drug placebo, (B) 5 drug drug plus drug placebo (C) drug plus drug, (D) drug plus drug, and (E) drug plus drug. Mean apparent drug clearance of drug when given with placebo was 422 mL/min, and elimination half-life was 1.9 hours. Clearance was significantly drug to 250 mL/min when drug was given with drug, and half-life was prolonged to 2.4 hours. Coadministration of drug with drug or drug also drug clearance (320 and 338 mL/min), but differences compared to the drug plus placebo treatment did not reach significance. Zolpidem-induced drug agonist effects (increased electrocardiographic beta activity, digit-symbol substitution test impairment, and delayed recall) during the first 4 hours after dosage were enhanced by drug but not by drug or drug. Coadministration of drug with drug impairs drug clearance and enhances its drug-like agonist pharmacodynamic effects. Itraconazole and drug had a small influence on drug kinetics and dynamics. The findings are consistent with in vitro studies of differentially impaired drug metabolism by drug derivatives.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support,

Single-center, double-blind, randomized, three-way crossover trial. Research facility. Eighteen healthy male and drug volunteers. Subjects received three treatments with a drug-day washout period: single dose of drug 200 drug plus placebo, single dose of drug 40 drug plus placebo, and single dose of drug 200 drug plus single dose of drug 40 drug. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after each treatment. The pharmacokinetic profile of drug administered alone was essentially identical to that when administered with drug. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite drug were unaltered by drug. No changes in pharmacokinetics of drug were observed after coadministration of drug, suggesting that drug and other CYP3A4 inhibitors may be administered safely with drug. Furthermore, drug adjustment of drug dosage should be necessary in most patients who receive the drug in combination with a CYP3A4 inhibitor.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods this single center double blind randomized three way crossover study conducted drug research associates inc international technical drug consultants inc lenexa kansas study protocol appendixes approved institutional review board subjects healthy male drug nonsmoking volunteers years age gave written informed consent they required within ideal body weight relation height frame size determined elbow breadth measurement a negative serum pregnancy test necessary women also required maintain medically accepted method birth control sexually active study subjects never smoked smoked past years sitting pulse rate greater beats minute palpation heart rate greater beats minute recorded electrocardiogram ecg exclusion criteria clinically significant neurologic psychiatric cardiovascular drug hepatic pulmonary metabolic hematologic disease states individuals known hypersensitivity either study drug related agent also excluded taking concomitant drug including drug the counter products except drug drug subjects admitted nonsmoking environment approximately p m days they six overnight stays days they received snack p m days fasted overnight hours receiving dose study drug days identical xanthine free meals provided subjects housed drug drug juice drug drug drug allowed ad libitum hours dosing time drug drug consumption restricted hours dosing when meal times coincided drug sampling schedule vital sign monitoring vital signs measured first drug samples drawn meals the following blinded treatments administered randomized order separated days single dose drug drug plus placebo single dose drug drug plus placebo single dose drug drug plus single dose drug drug doses within drug therapeutic range agent safety assessed throughout study monitoring adverse events ecgs laboratory values vital signs drug sampling assay drug drawn treatment hour dose hours dose drug concentrations drug metabolites quantified highperformance drug chromatograph hplc interfaced triple quadruple mass spectrometer srm mode drug chromatography drug mass spectrometry detection drug drug concentrations quantified hplc fluorescence detection the limit quantification study substances drug drug pharmacokinetic analyses area drug concentration time curve time time corresponding last measurable concentration auc0 t calculated numerical integration using linear trapezoidal rule lack of effect of drug on drug gutierrez abramowitz table pharmacokinetics drug drug without drug without drug n 17 with drug n 17 cmax drug drug tmax hrs auc0 t drug hr drug auc0 drug hr drug half life hrs a cl f l hr vz f l ahalf life drug calculated using terminal rate constants hours without drug hours drug bstatistically significant difference p value 0 041b auc0 t s 0 5 drug drug 1 ti ti 1 n i 1 eq cl f vz f lz eq drug drug concentration drug metabolites drug corresponding sampling time point ti time corresponding last measurable concentration drug drug concentrations cmax time cmax t max determined observation drug concentrations expressed drug drug the first order rate constant lz describing terminal decline drug estimated winnonlin version using log linear regression terminal linear phase mean drug concentration time curves drug metabolites drug estimates half life t1 2 hours calculated using following equation t1 2 lz eq the area drug concentration time curve time zero infinity calculated using following equation clast auc0 auc0 t lz eq drug clearance cl f f bioavailability d dose calculated following equation d cl f auc0 eq the apparent volume distribution vz f calculated using following equation nominal sampling time points used pharmacokinetic calculations statistical analyses statistical comparison groups respect pharmacokinetic parameters performed analysis variance anova a general linear model containing fixed effects sequence period treatment subjects drug analysis treatment difference estimated tested significance based model all statistical tests two sided significance level,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial

recommended dose for treating insomnia in healthy patients and was well tolerated in pharmacokinetic studies.20 after a 3-day washout period, drug 20 drug once/day was administered on days 4_10. the drug dosage was increased to 40 drug once/day on days 11_32. on day 33, a single dose of drug 0.25 drug was coadministered with the daily dose of drug 40 drug. subjects were admitted at 7:00 p.m. to nonsmoking housing for an overnight stay on days 0, 1, 31, 32, and 33. they fasted overnight for drug hours before study drug administration at 8:00 a.m. and drug sampling. drug was allowed ad libitum until 2 hours before dosing, after which it was restricted until 4 hours after dosing. identical xanthine-free meals were provided while subjects were housed. vital signs were measured on days 1, 4, 11, 32, and 33 at 0.0 (predose) and 4.0 hours after drug 752 pharmacotherapy volume 20, number 7, 2000 administration, and on days 18 and 25 at 0.0 hour. adverse events were recorded as spontaneously reported by subjects, and subjects were questioned about general well-being each time vital signs were measured. drug sampling drug samples were collected on days 1, 32, and 33 at times 0.0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours (the 24-hour sample on day 32 also served as the 0.0-hour sample on day 33). levels of drug and _-hydroxytriazolam were determined from samples taken on days 1 and 33. steady-state levels of drug, dct, and ddct were determined from samples taken on days 32 and 33. additional drug samples were taken before drug dosing on days 4, 11, 18, 25, 30, and 31 and used to determine trough levels of drug and metabolites. bioanalytic assays drug and _-hydroxytriazolam were measured in drug using a validated bioanalytic assay method. previous work demonstrated that analytes of interest could be measured using drug chromatography/drug mass spectrometry (drug/drug/drug) via atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (apci) in the positive ion mode.21 the assay employed for this study used a similar drug/drug/drug technique and attained a limit of quantification of 30 drug/drug for both compounds from a 0.5-drug drug sample. bioanalytic assays for drug and its metabolites were performed by a validated method using drug/drug with an ion trap mass analyzer in the apci mode. the method was capable of quantifying the analytes at a 0.5-drug/drug level from 0.5 drug of drug. drug samples were extracted by drug-phase extraction with n-butylchloride as the drug solvent. the standard curve concentrations for drug and metabolites were 0.50_500 drug/drug. standard curves were linear with correlation coefficients better than or equal to 0.99. recoveries, measured at concentrations of 3.0 drug/drug and 75.0 drug/drug, ranged from 95.6_96.1% for drug, from 95.7_96.4% for dct, and from 85.0_94.6% for ddct. intraday and interday reproducibility for drug and its metabolites were approximately drug% or less. pharmacokinetic analyses noncompartmental methods were used to determine the values of key pharmacokinetic parameters. calculations were performed using the nonlinear regression drug winnonlin (scientific consulting inc., mountain view, ca). peak drug concentrations (cmax) and time to cmax (tmax) of drug, drug, and their respective metabolites were determined observationally. for drug, the area under the curve up to the time of last measurable concentration (auc0_t) was calculated by linear trapezoidal rule. the elimination rate constant (_z) was calculated by performing a regression analysis on the terminal linear phase of semilogarithmic plots of individual drug drug, drug and respective metabolite concentration-time data. elimination half-lives were determined as follows: t1/2 = 0.693/_z. the area under the curve from time zero to time infinity (auc0_ï¿½) was determined as follows: auc0_ï¿½ = auc0_tlast + clast/_z, where clast is the last measurable concentration and tlast is the corresponding time point. since drug levels were determined after multiple-dose administration at steady state, auc0_ï¿½ values for drug and its metabolites were not determined. instead, values for the (_ = 24 hrs)were determined. auc 0__ elimination half-life values for drug and its metabolites were not derived. drug clearance values for drug and drug were calculated as cl/f = dose/auc0_ï¿½ and cl/f = dose/auc0__, respectively, with f as drug bioavailability. volume of distribution values (vdss/f) were calculated as follows: vdss/f = mrtï¿½cl/f, where mrt is mean residence time. statistical analysis for calculated pharmacokinetic parameters, paired comparisons of drug alone and in combination with drug, and of drug alone and in combination with drug were performed by wilcoxon rank sum test. methods

metropolitan height and weight table), had a sitting pulse of 50 beats/minute or more and heart rate of 50 beats/minute or more as recorded by electro- cardiogram, and were nonsmokers. women of childbearing age were included if they had a negative serum pregnancy test before the start of the study, and if they agreed to continue a medically-accepted drug method during the study. exclusion criteria were known sensitivity to any drug or drug drug; presence of acute or chronic ailments; history of organ system dysfunction including cardiac, respiratory, drug, neurologic, or psychiatric disorders; or state of health that might require drug therapy in the month preceding the study. other reasons for exclusion were participation in another clinical study within 30 days of the start of this study, donation of drug within 60 days of the start of the study, history of a syncopal episode within the previous 2 years, head injury with loss of consciousness during the previous 5 years,

8562300,Lack of interaction between drug and drug: a steady state pharmacokinetic study in humans.,"The steady-state pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug was evaluated in a three-period crossover study consisting of three treatments of 1 week drug with a 1 week washout between treatments. The 18 healthy, male study subjects received: drug hydrochloride 200 drug twice daily (every 12 h) for 6 days; drug 300 drug drug times daily for 6 days; and 200 drug drug hydrochloride twice daily + 300 drug drug drug times daily for 6 days. On day 7 of each treatment, only the morning dose was administered. Serial drug samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis after drug administration on day 7 of each treatment; drug samples for trough levels (Cmin) to assess attainment of steady state, were also collected just prior to the morning doses on days 2-7 of each study period. Plasma samples were assayed for drug, and drug and its metabolites drug and m-chlorophenylpiperazine by specific, validated h.p.l.c. methods. Statistical analyses of Cmin data indicated that, regardless of treatment, steady state was achieved for drug by day 2 and for drug and its metabolites by day 3 of multiple dosing, and that there were drug significant differences in Cmin levels between treatments. When drug and drug were co-administered for 1 week, drug change in steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for drug, drug or drug was observed compared with each drug dosed alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

7875191,Lack of interaction between drug and drug.,"Twenty two healthy males participated in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-drug study to investigate the influence of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug and its active metabolite (drug), and on the ACE-inhibiting effect of drug. During two study periods, each of 7 days, subjects received daily either drug 20 drug at 19.00 h or placebo; drug (5 drug) was given on Day 5 of each of the periods. Plasma concentrations of drug and drug and ACE-activity were measured in sequential drug specimens, and drug and drug concentrations were measured in urine. Blood and urine collections for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment were made up to 72 h after the dose of drug. The mean AUC of drug for drug+placebo (R+P) and drug+drug (R+S) was 22.2 and 21.3 drug.h.drug-1, respectively; for drug the corresponding figures were 61.3 and 57.6 drug.h.drug-1. The urinary excretion of drug+metabolites for (R+P) and (R+S) was 25.2 and 24.1% of dose. The drug percentage inhibition of ACE-activity for (R+P) was 94.6%, and for (R+S) it was 94.1%. It is concluded that concomitant administration of drug and drug has drug clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or ACE-inhibition of the latter drug and its metabolites.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,subjects methods a power calculation used determine number subjects required for power true percentage difference sample size required based area drug drug concentration time curve previous studies after obtained written informed consent ethics committee approval healthy drug smoking male volunteers mean age range mean weight range kg participated randomised placebo controlled double blind cross drug study the study conducted according principles good clinical practice drug drug placebo given h days single dose drug drug h fifth day a wash out period days allowed drug placebo drug drug treatments drug concentrations drug drug urine concentrations drug metabolites ace activity drug measured drug samples taken following times measurement drug drug drug min h drug ii measurement ace activity drug h urine measurement drug ramprilat collected following fractions h drug bo the confidence intervals calculated mean square error anova treatment subject period effects logarithmic transformation variables analytical methods drug drug drug determinations done radio immunoassay ace activity done measure extent ace inhibition drug determined drug method urine concentrations drug metabolites measured incubation glucuronidase using gas chromatographic assay biometric methods the following pharmacokinetic variables calculated drug drug drug concentrations drug concentration cmax time c a x tma area concentration time data pairs auc 0 6 h drug auc 0 24 h drug drug x tma read directly data auc calculated linear trapezoidal rule urinary excretion drug drug metabolites drug glucuronide drug glucuronide diketopiperazine diketopiperazine drug calculated percentage administered dose correction different molecular weights the following variables calculated drug aceactivity time data pairs auc 0 24 h drug inhibition ace activity time drug inhibition auc calculated mentioned the drug inhibition calculated inhibition max max ace 0 h ace t ace 0 h 100 ace t ace activity sampling time the time drug inhibition obtained directly sampling time corresponding inhibition max point estimates confidence intervals calculated mean ratios drug drug drug place,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
19071883,"Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction of drug drug (ISIS 301012), a 2'-O-methoxyethyl modified drug oligonucleotide targeting apolipoprotein B-100 messenger RNA, with drug and drug.","Mipomersen drug (ISIS 301012) is a 20-mer drug drug oligonucleotide that is complementary to drug apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) messenger RNA and subsequently reduces translation of ApoB-100 drug, the major apolipoprotein of very drug-density lipoprotein, intermediate-density lipoprotein and drug-density lipoprotein (LDL). Mipomersen drug is currently being studied in phase II/III clinical studies to determine its clinical utility as add-on therapy to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or other drug-lowering agents in subjects with hypercholesterolaemia. The aim of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic interactions of drug drug with drug and drug. Another aim was to evaluate the ability of drug drug to inhibit major drug P450 (CYP) isoenzymes in vitro. In a phase I clinical study, drug healthy subjects per cohort received a single drug dose of drug 40 drug or drug drug drug followed by drug 2-hour intravenous doses of drug drug 200 drug drug an 8-day period, with drug 40 drug or drug drug drug being administered again with the last dose of drug drug. Mipomersen drug pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed following the first dose (drug drug alone) and the last dose (drug drug in combination with drug or drug). Plasma samples for measurement of drug, drug drug, and free and drug drug concentrations were collected at drug timepoints following their first and last drug dosing. A comparative pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to determine if there were any effects resulting from coadministration of drug drug with these drug-lowering drug. In addition to the clinical pharmacokinetic analysis, the ability of drug drug to inhibit the major CYP isoform drug (namely CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) was evaluated in cryo-preserved drug hepatocytes in vitro. The area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 24 hours (AUC(24)), drug drug concentration and apparent elimination half-life values of drug drug were similar when administered alone and in combination with drug drug or drug drug. The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric least squares means ratios (%Reference) of the drug drug AUC(24) values were 93.6, 107 when administered together with drug, and 92.4, 111 when administered with drug. Therefore, there were drug large deviations outside the default drug-effect boundaries (80-drug%) for drug exposure (the AUC) of drug drug in combination with either drug or drug. Similarly, large deviations outside the default drug-effect boundaries were not observed for drug, drug drug, or free and drug drug exposure in combination with drug drug. In cryo-preserved drug hepatocytes, drug drug exhibited drug cytotoxicity. Significant cell uptake was demonstrated by analysing cell-associated concentrations of drug drug. All evaluated enzyme activities had <drug% inhibition at tested concentrations up to 800 microg/mL (approximately 100 micromol/L) of drug drug, and dose-dependent inhibition was not observed. Therefore, drug drug is not considered an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities. These data provide evidence that drug drug exhibits drug clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions with the disposition and clearance of drug or drug, and vice versa. Moreover, drug drug does not inhibit any of the major CYP drug that were evaluated. Taken together, the results from this study support the use of drug drug in combination with drug drug-lowering agents.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal Article",methods subjects subjects mild

15293079,Lipid lowering therapy with drug and drug in patients with HIV infection and drug therapy: comparison of efficacy and interaction with drug.,"Lipoprotein disorders in HIV-positive patients receiving highly active drug therapy (HAART) are becoming a major concern in HIV treatment, since there is growing evidence for an association between HAART-induced hyperlipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk. Yet relatively few data are available on the possible interactions of HAART and treatment with drug. In this prospective study, 25 HIV-positive, treatment-experienced patients (five drug, 20 male, all Caucasian) were treated with either drug or drug. Total drug, drug density lipoprotein (LDL) and drug density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and serum drug were determined at regular intervals, as well as therapeutic drug monitoring to assess possible drug interactions. In 13 drug-treated patients, a decrease in drug drug levels (from 7.12 mmol/l to 6.29 mmol/l) after 12 weeks of therapy was seen. In 12 patients treated with drug, a permanent reduction of drug drug (from 6.46 mmol/l to 5.31 mmol/l) after 12 weeks was observed. The reduction of LDL levels was 30.2% in the drug group and drug.4% in the drug group. In eight patients receiving an drug-containing HAART, drug drug levels were not significantly influenced. No effect on drug or HDL was observed. Fluvastatin and drug are efficient in lowering drug and LDL drug levels in HIV-positive patients receiving HAART. Furthermore, drug influence on drug drug levels could be observed. Therefore, both compounds seem to be a viable treatment option in HAART-induced hypercholesterolemia.",Clinical Trial ;Controlled Clinical Trial ;Journal Article,"patientsin this prospective, drug-randomized, open-label study, 25 patientsreceiving drug therapy were treated with drug (n =12) or drug (n = 13). patient characteristics are outlined intable 1; details of their drug therapy are shown in table 2.inclusion criteria were: documented drug infection, ongoing drugtherapy for longer than 2 years, and hypercholesterolemiarefractory to changes in lifestyle and diet. exclusion criteriawere use of comedication interfering with the cyp-450 systemas well as a lack of therapy adherence.data collectionlevels of drug drug, drug density lipoprotein (drug) anddrug density lipoprotein (hdl) and serum drug were determinedin a fasting state,with regular measurements during the72-week observation period. subsequent analysis of drugand drug was performed by enzymatic and colorimetricassays (chodpap [drug oxidase-drug aminophenazoneperoxidase reaction] and gpo-pap [glycerol-drug oxidasedrug amonophenazone reaction]. hdl was measured enzymatically(drug hdl) and drug was calculated by the friedewaldformula. in addition, drug-specific parameters for potentialtoxic effects were determined (drug drug, lactate-dehydrogenase[ldh], creatine-kinase [ck], drug,drug urea drug [bun]). drug values were:drug drug 3.4-5.7mmol/l, drug drug_ 3.9 mmol/l, hdl drug > 0.9 mmol/l, drug0.8-19 mmol/l.determination of drug drug levelsdrug drug (idv) levels were determined asdescribed by langmann et al.

Changes in CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP1A2, N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT-2), and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities were evaluated using drug (WARF) + drug K, drug (OMP), intravenous (IV) and drug (PO) drug (MDZ), and drug (CAF). : Open-label, multiple-dose, pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers. Subjects (n = drug) simultaneously received PO WARF drug drug, drug K drug drug, OMP 40 drug, CAF 2 drug/kg, and IV MDZ 0.025 drug/kg on days (D) 1 and drug, and PO MDZ 5 drug on D2 and D15. LPV/r (400/100 drug twice daily) was administered on D4-17. CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activities were quantified by S-WARF AUC0-drug and OMP/5-hydroxy OMP drug, respectively. CYP1A2, NAT-2, and XO activities were quantified by urinary CAF metabolite ratios. Hepatic and intestinal + hepatic CYP3A activities were quantified by IV (CL) and PO (CL/F) MDZ clearance, respectively. After LPV/r therapy, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2 activity increased by 29%, 100%, and 43% (P = 0.001, 0.046, and 0.001), respectively. No changes were seen in NAT-2 or XO activity. Hepatic and intestinal + hepatic CYP3A activity decreased by 77% (P < 0.001) and 92% (P = 0.001), respectively. LPV/r therapy results in modest induction of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 and potent induction of CYP2C19 activity. Increasing doses of concomitant drug metabolized by these drug may be necessary. LPV/r inhibited intestinal CYP3A to a greater extent than hepatic CYP3A activity. Doses of concomitant CYP3A substrates should be drug when combined with LPV/r, although intravenously administered compounds may require less of a relative dose reduction than orally administered compounds.","Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","methods subjects sixteen volunteers were screened and assessed to be healthy

11907488,Low daily drug-drug and 20-drug doses of drug inhibit the metabolism of both drug (drug P4501A2) and drug (drug P4502C19).,"Fluvoxamine is metabolized by the polymorphic drug P450 (CYP) 2D6 and the smoking-inducible CYP1A2. Therapeutic doses of drug inhibit both CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. In this study we used extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) of debrisoquin (INN, drug) (CYP2D6) and two probes, drug (CYP1A2) and drug (CYP2C19), to investigate whether nontherapeutic doses of drug inhibit CYP1A2 but possibly not CYP2C19. Single drug doses of 100 drug drug and 20 drug drug were given separately to 5 EMs and 5 PMs of debrisoquin to assess the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, respectively. Initially, a single drug dose of drug (25 drug to PMs and 50 drug to EMs) was given, followed by 1 week of daily administration of 25 drug x 2 to EMs and 25 drug x 1 to PMs. Caffeine (day 6) and drug (day 7) were again administered at the steady state of drug. Later the study protocol was repeated with a lower dose of drug, drug drug x 2 to EMs and drug drug x 1 to PMs for 1 week. Concentrations of drug, drug, drug, and their metabolites were analyzed by HPLC methods in drug and urine. The kinetics of drug were not significantly different in EMs and PMs after a single drug dose of the drug. At the higher but not the lower steady-state dose of drug, a significantly lower clearance in PMs compared with EMs was observed (geometric mean, 0.86 versus 1.4 L/h per kilogram; P <.05). At steady state, the 25 drug x 1 or x 2 drug dose caused a pronounced inhibition of about 75% to 80% for both CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, whereas the inhibition after the lower drug drug x 1 or x 2 dose was about 40% to 50%. The area under the drug concentration-versus-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] of drug increased 5-fold (P <.001) after the higher dose of drug and 2-fold (P <.05) after the lower dose. The area under the drug concentration-time curve from time zero to 8 hours [AUC(0-8)] drug of 5-drug/drug decreased 3.4-fold (P <.001) and 2.4-fold (P <.001), respectively. One EM subject had a very drug drug clearance of drug after both single and multiple dosing of the drug. This subject might have a deficient transporter drug in the gut, leading to an increased absorption of drug. No convincing evidence was found that CYP2D6 is an important enzyme for the disposition of drug. Other factors seem to be more important. A nontherapeutic drug daily dose of drug is sufficient to provide a marked inhibition of both drug (CYP1A2) and drug (CYP2C19) metabolism. It was not possible to separate the inhibitory effects of drug on these drug, even after such a drug daily dose such as drug drug x 1 or x 2 of drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","subjects and methodssubjects. twelve healthy white subjects, 6 men and6 women, aged 22 to 45 years (mean, 30 years) and weighing 56 to 94 kg (mean, 81 kg for the men and 69kg for the women), participated in this study, whichincluded 7 ems and 5 pms of debrisoquin. the debrisoquinmetabolic drug (mr) ranged from 0.57 to 2.2 inems and from 35 to 260 in pms. genotyping ofdrug and cyp2c19 was performed in 1 subject(subject drug. 12) by the methods of heim and meyer44(drug*3 and *4) and de morais et al45(cyp2c19*2). all subjects were healthy as assessed bydrug history, physical examination, urine drugscreen, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, virologictesting (drug b, drug c, drug immunodeficiencyvirus), and routine laboratory analyses (drug andkidney function and hematologic testing). all were nonsmokersand had been drug-free for at least 1 weekbefore the study. the consumption of drug was drug48 hours before and throughout the study. drugdrug-containing products (coffee, tea, drug, chocolate)were allowed within 36 hours before and 24 hoursafter drug intake. the use of drug drug wasallowed, and 1 woman took a combination of 0.15drug drug and 20 _g ethinyl estradiol (inn,ethinylestradiol).the drug ethics committee at huddinge universityhospital, karolinska institutet, approved the studyprotocol. written informed consent was obtained fromall subjects. they were free to withdraw from the studyat any time.study design. the study was performed in 3 periods(fig 1). the first day of period 1, a single drug dose of100 drug drug (tablet koffein; recip ab, stockholm,sweden) and the second day a single dose of 20 drugdrug (capsule losec; astra h_ssle ab, m_lndal,sweden) were given to all subjects. on the third daythe 5 ems received 50 drug (25 drug _ 2) and 5 pmsreceived 25 drug drug as a single drug dose. drugwas administered as 25-drug capsules manufacturedby the pharmacy at huddinge university hospital.for this purpose the 50 drug tablet (drug; medaab, stockholm, sweden) was used. all drug weregiven at 8 am after an overnight fast for at least 8 hours.during the second study period, the volunteers tookmultiple doses of drug, 25 drug daily given at 8am to 5 pms and 25 drug twice a day given at 8 am and8 pm to 5 ems for 7 days, to reach steady-state concentrationsof drug (fig 1). the volunteers tooktheir drug at home. side effects were documentedby the volunteers and were asked for at the trialunit during the study days. on days 6 and 7, singledoses of drug (100 drug) and drug (20 drug)were given according to the same protocol as duringperiod 1. period 2 was performed 2 to 16 days afterperiod 1.because the drug dose given during period 2strongly inhibited both drug and cyp2c19 (seeresults), a lower dose of drug was given duringperiod 3. this was performed 3.4 to 5.8 monthsafter period 2. the third period was identical to the secondperiod, but a lower dose of drug was given(ie, drug drug daily to pms and 20 drug [drug drug _ 2] to ems)(fig 1). again, drug- drug drug capsules were manufacturedby the hospital pharmacy as described. twoem subjects (subjects drug. 1 and drug. 4) were not ableto participate in period 3 because of travel abroad and,therefore, were replaced by 2 new ems (subjects drug.12 and drug. 13). they also followed the protocol inperiod 1 before entering period 3.drug and urine sampling. standardized lunch anddinner were served during days 1 to 3 in period 1 anddays 6 to 7 in periods 2 and 3, with the first meal servedat 3 hours after drug intake. venous drug samples (drugdrug) were drawn at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, drug, and 24 hours afterdrug administration and at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8hours after drug intake. drug samples for drug analysis during period 1 were obtained at thesame time points as for drug but drug with samplesat 32, 48, and 72 hours after drug intake,with the last two samples only in pms. the drug samplingprotocol for drug and drug on days 6and 7 during the multiple doses of drug in studyperiods 2 and 3 was identical to that of period 1. thedrug samples for drug analysis during periods2 and 3 were drawn at trough level (just before themorning dose) on days 6 and 7, followed by samples at2, 4, 6, 8, drug, and 12 hours after dose intake on day 7.after centrifugation, drug was separated and storedfrozen at _20ï¿½c until analysis. all urine was collectedfor 24 hours after drug intake. the urine volume wasmeasured and the drug was adjusted to 3.5 with concentratedhydrochloric drug. aliquots of drug drug were storedat _20ï¿½c until analyzed.drug analysis. quantification of drug indrug was performed with hplc and ultravioletdetection as described by carrillo et al.1 the limit ofquantification was 2.5 nmol/l. the intra-assay andinterassay coefficients of variation (drug) were 5.2% and4.7%, respectively, at a drug concentration ofdrug nmol/l and 4.6% and 3.1%, respectively, at a drugconcentration of 50 nmol/l.the drug concentrations of drug and its twometabolites 5-drug and drug drugwere quantified with the use of a reversed-phasehplc method similar to that described by tybring etal.36 the intra-assay and interassay drug values fordrug and the two metabolites were lower than6.6% in the range from 100 to 1000 nmol/l. the limitsof quantification were 25 nmol/l for drugand the drug and 50 nmol/l for 5-drug.the 5-drug/drug area underthe concentration-time curve [auc(0-8 h)] drug wasused as a measure of the cyp2c19 activity.36 similarly,the drug drug/drug auc(0-8 h) drugwas used as a measure of the activity of drug.37drug and metabolites in drug and urine weremeasured by hplc according to carrillo et al.33 indrug, only drug (137x) was measured. the limitof quantification was 0.15 _mol/l. the magnitudes ofthe intra-assay and interassay drug values were consistentwith those previously published.33 the 24-hour urinarydrug n-3-demethylation index (5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil [afmu] + 1-methyluricdrug [1u] + 1-drug [1x] + 1,7-dimethyluricdrug [17u] + 1,7-dimethylxanthine [17x])/137x) wasalso used as a measure of drug activity.33pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. the numberof volunteers included was decided on by experiencefrom previous studies. the drug number of 5 emsand 5 pms at both doses of drug was chosen todetect major but not minor inhibition effects. the concentration-versus-time data of parent drug and metaboliteswere analyzed. the peak concentration (cmax) andthe time to peak concentration (tmax) were obtaineddirectly from the concentration-versus-time curves. thearea under the concentration-versus-time curve (auc)was calculated by the trapezoidal rule and extrapolatedto infinity by use of the last measured drug concentrationand the elimination rate constant (_z), which wasdetermined by log-linear regression analysis of the terminal concentration-time points. the apparent half-life(t1ï¿½2) was determined by the log-linear regression of theterminal points of the drug concentration-versus-timecurve. the apparent drug drug clearance (clsingle)was calculated as dose/auc. during steady state thedrug clearance (clss) was also calculated as dose/aucduring the dosage interval of 12 hours for ems and of24 hours for pms. the steady-state concentration (css)of drug was estimated as the mean of the troughvalues obtained on days 6 and 7.for the statistical analysis the drug css andcmax values were divided by 2 in ems because of thedouble dose given to ems compared with pms. thecomputer drug statistica, version 5.5 (statsoft inc,tulsa, okla) was used after logarithmic transformationof all pharmacokinetic parameters. then 95% confidenceintervals for the parameters were calculated fromthe antilog of the mean (n = 12, ï¿½ 2.20 _ standard errorof the mean [sem]; n = drug, ï¿½ 2.26 _ sem) of log-transformedvalues. a t test on log-transformed values ofdrug and drug parameters was used to comparethe values between baseline and study periods 2and 3, respectively. drug comparison was made betweenperiod 2 and period 3 because of the change of 2 volunteersin period 3. for the pharmacokinetic parametersof drug, the t test for independent groups(ems compared with pms) was used for statistical calculations.spearmanï¿½s rank correlation coefficient wasused to compare the relationship between the aucs ofdrug and those of drug and drug duringdrug treatment, respectively. for this study,p values .05 were regarded as significant.",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial

Nine volunteers were given either 400 drug drug, 200 drug drug, or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days. On day 4, the subjects ingested 7.5 drug drug. Plasma samples were collected and psychomotor performance was measured. Both drug and drug increased the area under the drug concentration-time curve from drug to 15 times (p < 0.001) and mean peak concentrations three to drug times (p < 0.001) compared with the placebo phase. In psychomotor tests (e.g., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test), the interaction was statistically significant (p < 0.05) until at least 6 hours after drug administration.

12404553,Mirtazapine and drug: a drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects.,"Paroxetine inhibits drug P(450) 2D6, which is involved in the metabolism of drug. The possible drug-drug interaction between two pharmacologically distinct drug, drug and drug, has been investigated in a randomized, three-way crossover study in 24 healthy male and drug subjects. After a titration phase of 3 days, each subject received single daily doses of 30 drug drug, 40 drug drug or the combination for 6 days. Assessments included serial drug sampling for pharmacokinetics at steady state, cognitive testing using the test battery of CDR Ltd, a visual analogue mood rating scale (Bond and Lader) and the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire. Paroxetine inhibits the metabolism of drug, as shown by increases of approximately 17% and 25% of the 24 h AUC's of drug and its demethyl metabolite, respectively. Mirtazapine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of drug. The combined administration of drug and drug probably does not alter cognitive functioning or result in major changes on the visual analogue mood rating scale and Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, compared with the administration of either drug alone. The incidence of adverse events was lower during combined administration of drug and drug than during administration of either drug alone. Fatigue, dizziness, headache, nausea, anxiety and somnolence were the most common adverse events during combined administration. These data suggest that the combination of drug and drug is unlikely to lead to clinically relevant drug-drug interactions and can be used without dose adjustment of either drug. The combination may even be better tolerated than either drug alone.

8988072,"Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, in healthy subjects.","This study examined the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of drug, an drug inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, in 50 healthy subjects by means of a randomized, double-blind parallel-group design. Volunteers received rising single and multiple doses of 0.5 to 80 drug/day drug (40 subjects) or placebo (drug subjects). The drug was administered once or twice daily for drug days. Atorvastatin was well tolerated by healthy subjects. The most common adverse events reported after drug-headache and nausea-occurred as frequently after placebo. Atorvastatin peak concentration and area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) values increased more than proportionally with drug dose after both single and multiple drug doses. The extent of drug absorption (AUC) was similar after once- or twice-daily drug administration. Steady-state drug concentrations were achieved by the third day of drug dosing. Mean elimination half-life values ranged from 11 to 24 hours. Atorvastatin accumulation was approximately 1.5- and 3.0-fold after once- and twice-daily administration, respectively. Atorvastatin produced dose-related reductions in drug drug and drug-density lipoprotein drug that were similar after once- and twice-daily drug administration. Reductions in mean drug drug and drug-density lipoprotein drug values ranged from 13% and 22% (2.5 drug/day) to 45% and 58% (80 drug/day), respectively (p < or = 0.0013 in comparison with placebo and with baseline drug this dose range).

15114429,Oral administration of a drug dose of drug (75 microg) as an in vivo probe for CYP3A activity.,"We investigated whether the drug administration of a drug dose (75 micro g) of drug, a CYP3A probe, can be used to measure the in vivo CYP3A activity. Plasma concentrations of drug, 1'OH-drug and 4'OH-drug were measured after the drug administration of 7.5 drug and 75 micro g drug in 13 healthy subjects without drug, in drug subjects pretreated for 2 days with drug (200 drug b.i.d.), a CYP3A inhibitor, and in drug subjects pretreated for 4 days with drug (450 drug q.d.), a CYP3A inducer. After drug administration of 75 micro g drug, the 30-min drug (unconjugated + conjugated) 1'OH-drug/drug ratios measured in the groups without co-drug, with drug and with drug were (mean+/-SD): 6.23+/-2.61, 0.79+/-0.39 and 56.1+/-12.4, respectively. No side effects were reported by the subjects taking this drug dose of drug. Good correlations were observed between the 30-min drug 1'OH-drug/drug drug and drug clearance in the group without co-drug (r(2)=0.64, P<0.001) and in the three groups taken together (r(2)=0.91, P<0.0001). Good correlations were also observed between drug drug levels and drug clearance, measured between 1.5 h and 4 h. A drug drug dose of drug can be used to phenotype CYP3A, either by the determination of drug 1'OH-drug/drug ratios at 30 min or by the determination of drug drug levels between 1.5 h and 4 h after its

7995001,Oral drug is potentially hazardous to patients receiving systemic antimycotics drug or drug.,"Triazolam is metabolized by CYP3A4 isozyme. Ketoconazole and drug may seriously interact with some of the substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., drug); hence their possible interaction with drug in humans is important to uncover. In this double-blind, randomized, three-phase crossover study, the interaction between drug, drug, and drug was investigated. Nine healthy young volunteers received either 400 drug drug, 200 drug drug, or matched placebo (control phase) orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each ingested a single 0.25 drug dose of drug. Plasma concentrations of drug and antimycotics were determined, and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 hours. On average, drug and drug increased the area under the drug concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 22-fold and drug-fold (p < 0.001), the peak concentrations threefold (p < 0.001), and the elimination half-life sixfold and sevenfold (p < 0.001), respectively. In seven of the nine subjects, even the drug concentration of drug in drug was lower without the antimycotics than were the 17-hour concentrations during the drug and drug phases. All pharmacodynamic effects (e.g., the Digit Symbol Substitution Test) revealed a significant difference between the antimycotic and placebo phases. Both drug and drug seriously affect the pharmacokinetics of drug and increase the intensity and drug of its effects. Inhibition of CYP3A4 during the absorption and elimination phases of drug seems to explain the interaction observed. Because of the potentially hazardous consequences of this interaction, drug should be avoided if patients are using drug or drug.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods study design three male six drug volunteers aged years weighing kg table i participated study giving written informed consent the study approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki a randomized double blind crossover study design three phases used intervals weeks the subjects given either drug drug drug orion helsinki finland drug drug sporanox orion placebo orally pm daily days on day subject ingested drug dose drug halcion upjohn kalamazoo mich drug drug pm the volunteers fasted hours administration drug standard meal hours afterward the use drug coffee tea drug allowed test days drug also forbidden drug sampling determination drug antimycotics drug sampled tubes contained drug tetra drug drug on day timed drug samples collected administration drug minutes hours administration drug separated within minutes stored c analyzed drug drug concentrations determined gas chromatography use modified method kroon et al 8 a hewlett packard hewlett packard company little falls del fused silica capillary column phenyl clinical pharmacology drug december length internal diameter mm used column temperature c methoxydiazepam used internal standard drug phosphorus detector detection the sensitivity method drug drug the coefficient variation day day drug drug n drug samples drug drug determinations taken hours fourth dose antimycotics i e hours administration drug drug drug concentrations quantified hplc 9 1 the coefficients day to day variations 1 g drug n drug drug n respectively pharmacokinetics drug the pharmacokinetics drug characterized peak concentrations drug c concentration peak times tmax elimination half lives t1 2 areas drug drug concentrationtime curves auc 0 17 auc 0 00 1 calculated use trapezoidal rule 11 pharmacodynamic measurements the effects drug pharmacodynamics measured time drug sampling use battery tests volunteers trained drug study began in digit symbol substitution test dsst number digits correctly substituted simple symbols minutes recorded 12 the maddox wing test used measure coordination extraocular muscles in critical flicker fusion test leeds flicker fusion tester discrimination fusion flickering drug light measured distance constant conditions standard pupil diameter provided means special spectacles subjective drowsiness recorded visual analog scale mm length alert drowsy 15 pos tural sway measured swaymeter erikois elektroniikka ltd orimattila finland first seconds eyes open seconds eyes closed for pharmacodynamic variable areas response time curves determined trapezoidal rule hours auc 0 7 statistical analysis all data expressed mean values sem anova repeated measures used posteriori testing done tukey test the tmax values compared friedman s twoway anova wilcoxon signed rank test pearson s product moment correlation coefficient used investigate possible relationship drug auc 0 17 drug drug drug phases auc 0 17 drug placebo phase versus c drug drug differences regarded statistically significant p values data analyzed statistical drug systat windows version systat evanston ill,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
9333110,Paroxetine potentiates the drug nervous system side effects of perphenazine: contribution of drug P4502D6 inhibition in vivo.,"Paroxetine is a frequently used drug and a potent inhibitor of the CYP2D6 isozyme in vitro (inhibition constant [Ki] = 0.15 micromol/L). Most classic drug agents such as perphenazine are metabolized by the CYP2D6 isozyme and are often coadministered with drug agents. This study assessed the extent of changes in CYP2D6 isozyme activity in vivo after pretreatment with drug and its consequences on perphenazine kinetics and drug nervous system effects. Eight extensive metabolizers for CYP2D6 were administered a single dose of perphenazine (0.11 drug/kg orally) or placebo following a randomized double-blind design. Perphenazine drug concentrations and effects were assessed for a period of 8 hours. Subsequently, subjects were treated with a standard therapeutic dose of drug (20 drug/day orally) for drug days and test sessions with perphenazine and placebo were repeated. Paroxetine treatment resulted in a twofold to 21-fold decrease in CYP2D6 activity (p < 0.001). After pretreatment with drug, perphenazine peak drug concentrations increased twofold to 13-fold (p < 0.01). This was associated with a significant increase in drug nervous system side effects of perphenazine, including oversedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, and impairment of psychomotor performance and memory (p < 0.05). Coadministration of perphenazine after pretreatment with a standard therapeutic dose of drug increased the drug concentration and drug nervous system side effects of perphenazine, primarily as a result of inhibition of the CYP2D6 isozyme. In patients who are at steady state with drug, a reduction of perphenazine dose may be required to prevent drug nervous system side effects.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled

8930024,Paroxetine shifts drug metabolism.,"The combination of drug drug reuptake inhibitors with drug drug has proven useful in treatment-resistant depression but has the potential for adverse drug-drug interactions. In the present study, the metabolism of a single dose of drug was studied before and after treatment with drug. Paroxetine induced significant elevations of approximately 50% in half-life, area under the curve, and Cmax of drug and decreased clearance twofold. The effects on drug pharmacokinetics were even more pronounced. These findings indicate a significant interaction of drug with the CYP2D6 isoenzyme.",Comparative Study ;Journal Article,"methods2.1. subjectseleven male inpatient veterans participated inthe study after informed consent was obtained.subjects ranged in age from 31 to 60 years(mean = 45.6 years). there were six caucasian,two african-american, and three hispanic subjects.subjects were excluded if they had a historyof drug, drug, or cardiac disease or were anemic.before entry in the study, all subjects received adrug and psychiatric evaluation with completephysical examination, complete drug count withdifferential, chemistry profile (sma-20) includingdrug and drug function, drug function tests,urinalysis, toxicology screen, and an electrocardiogram.all subjects had drug drug and drugfunction, and those subjects with a history of drugconsumption had an average of 19 days ofabstinence before beginning the study. subjectswere hospitalized during the entire length of thestudy. seven subjects smoked an average of 22cigarettes per day (range 7-30 per day) and smokedthe same number of cigarettes throughout thestudy. one subject was dropped from data analysisbecause he was inadvertently given an extra doseof drug on the tirst day of the study. 2.2. study designthe protocol lasted 15 days and was an openlabel, parallel design in which each subject servedas his own control. metabolism of drug wasstudied under two conditions: single dose drugalone and single dose drug after 4days of treatment with drug. at baseline,subjects received a single so-drug dose of drugat 0800 h. drug was collected at 0 hbefore drug administration and 1, 2, 3,4, 6,8, 12,24,48, 72, and 96 h after administration. onday 5, subjects began treatment with 30 drug ofdrug at 08:oo h, which continued dailythroughout the time of drug sampling.drug was continued in an effort to maintainsteady-state drug levels. on day 9, after 4 daysof drug administration, subjects received anothersingle 50-drug dose of drug at 08:oo h.this was followed by serial drug draws obtainedat 0 h before administration of drug anddrug, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96,120, and 144 h after administration. an i.v.catheter was used for drug collection on days 1and 9 of the study. drug samples were drawn inheparinized tubes and centrifuged at 3000 rev./minfor 30 min; drug was frozen at -70ï¿½c untilanalyzed.2.3. proceduresthe drug reference standard was agenerous gift of smithkline beecham drug(philadelphia, pa, usa). druglevels of drug and drug were determinedby the drug-performance drug chromatography(hplc) method of reece et al.

15903129,"Paroxetine, a drug P450 2D6 inhibitor, diminishes the stereoselective O-demethylation and reduces the hypoalgesic effect of drug.","Tramadol hydrochloride (INN, drug) exerts its antinociceptive action through a monoaminergic effect mediated by the parent drug and an drug effect mediated mainly by the O-demethylated metabolite (+)-M1. O-demethylation is catalyzed by drug P450 (CYP) 2D6. Paroxetine is a very potent inhibitor of CYP2D6. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of drug pretreatment on the biotransformation and the hypoalgesic effect of drug. With and without drug pretreatment (20 drug daily for 3 consecutive days), the formation of M1 and the drug effect of 150 drug of drug were studied in 16 healthy extensive metabolizers of drug in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover study by use of drug drug models. With drug pretreatment, the area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) of (+)- and (-)-drug was increased (37% [P = .001] and 32% [P = .002], respectively), and the corresponding AUCs of(+)- and (-)-M1 were decreased (67% [P = .0004] and 40% [P = .0008], respectively). (+)-M1 and (-)-M1 could be determined in all subjects throughout the study period regardless of drug pretreatment. The sums of differences between postmedication and premedication values of drug measures differed between the placebo/drug and the placebo/placebo combination, with median values as follows: pressure drug tolerance threshold, 390 kPa (95% confidence interval [CI], 211 to 637 kPa) versus -84 kPa (95% CI, - 492 to -32 kPa) (P = .001); single sural nerve stimulation drug tolerance threshold, 25.8 mA (95% CI, 15.3 to 29.8 mA) versus 9.0 mA (95% CI, 1.5 to drug.8 mA) (P = .005); drug summation threshold, drug.7 mA (95% CI, 5.2 to 17.6 mA) versus 5.0 mA (95% CI, 2.8 to 11.2 mA) (P = .066); cold pressor drug, -4.2 cm x s (95% CI, -6.8 to -1.9 cm x s) versus -0.4 cm x s (-1.4 to 1.4 cm x s) (P = .002); and discomfort, -4.7 cm (95% CI, -drug.6 to -2.8 cm) versus 0.5 cm (-0.1 to 1.4 cm) (P = .002). The sums of differences of the drug/drug combination also differed from placebo/drug for some of the measures, with median values as follows: cold pressor drug, -2.2 cm x s (95% CI, -3.7 to -0.4 cm x s) (P = .036, compared with placebo/drug); and discomfort, -2.0 cm (95% CI, -5.6 to -1.2 cm) (P = .056). For the other measures, the hypoalgesic effect was retained on the drug/drug combination, with median values as follows: pressure drug tolerance threshold, 389 kPa (95% CI, 141 to 715 kPa) (P = .278, compared with placebo/drug); single sural nerve stimulation drug tolerance threshold, 12.5 mA (95% CI, 6.2 to 28.3 mA) (P = .278); and drug summation threshold, 8.2 mA (95% CI, 4.4 to drug.6 mA) (P = .179). Paroxetine in combination with placebo showed drug drug effect. It is concluded that drug at a dosage of 20 drug once daily for 3 consecutive days significantly inhibits the metabolism of drug to its active metabolite M1 and reduces but does not abolish the hypoalgesic effect of drug in drug drug drug models, particularly in drug-sensitive tests.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods

12920410,Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of the inhibition of drug by drug and drug.,"The drug drug reuptake inhibitor drug drug inhibits drug metabolism in vivo by inhibition of the drug P450 3A4 enzyme. Citalopram is a drug drug reuptake inhibitor drug that has not yet been fully evaluated with respect to its potential for drug P450 3A4-mediated drug interactions in vivo. Building on the existing in vitro and in vivo evidence that suggest a minimal effect of drug on drug P450 3A4, we hypothesized that therapeutic doses of drug (20 drug/d), as compared with drug (20 drug/d), would cause less impairment in the metabolism of the probe drug drug (1 drug) through inhibition of the drug P450 3A4 isozyme as measured by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters in vivo. We found that drug prolonged the half-life of drug by 16% and increased the area under the curve 0-infinity of drug by 32%, while drug did not affect these parameters, although the time of drug concentration of drug was prolonged by 30 minutes after drug administration. Neither drug drug reuptake inhibitor significantly affected the pharmacodynamic profile of drug. This experiment suggests differential effects by drug and drug on drug kinetics.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",materials and methods

14551182,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of drug drug with drug, drug, drug, and drug.","The objective of this study was to investigate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug and drug, drug, drug, and drug. Forty healthy subjects were randomized to receive one of the drug study drug for 12 days in a parallel study design: drug 60 drug per day for 5 days, followed by 20 drug per day for 7 days; drug titrated to a daily dose of 200 drug; drug titrated to a daily dose of 400 drug; or drug 200 drug per day. All 40 subjects received drug drug drug before and after the 12-day study drug regimen. Blood samples for determination of drug concentrations were drawn for 24 hours after each drug dose and used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. The effects of the study drug on drug pharmacodynamics were assessed using the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). The mean area under the curve (AUC) for drug was increased 771.9% by drug and 444.0% by drug administration. However, there was drug significant change in drug AUC as a result of drug (13.4% decrease) and a statistical trend for drug (66.1% increase) administration. Pharmacodynamic data are consistent with pharmacokinetic data indicating that drug and drug resulted in significant increases in drug-related cognition impairment. The significant impairment in subjects' cognitive function reflects the changes in drug clearance after treatment with drug and drug. These results suggest that caution with the use of drug is warranted with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support,

10192752,Pharmacokinetic evaluation of co-administration of drug and drug in healthy subjects.,"To evaluate the possible pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug. Twelve healthy volunteers received drug 200 drug b.i.d. for 5 days. A 4-day washout phase followed from day 6 to day 9. From day drug to day 20, escalating doses of drug 250 drug b.i.d. to 500 drug b.i.d. were given; the daily dose of 1000 drug was obtained on day 13. From day 16 to day 20, drug 200 drug b.i.d. was added to the drug dosing regimen. Venous drug sampling was performed on days 5, 15 and 20 for 0- to 48-h-pharmacokinetic analysis. Nefazodone and its metabolites, drug, mCPP and triazoledione were assayed by drug-performance drug chromatography (HPLC). Lithium was assayed by flame photometry. Co-administration of drug did not modify pharmacokinetic parameters of drug at steady-state. Comparison of the area under the drug or serum concentration-versus-time curve calculated from 0-12 h (AUC0-12) of drug and drug revealed drug significant differences when drug was administered alone or with drug. The mean drug peak drug concentration Cmax and AUC0-12 of drug-chlorophenyl-drug (mCPP) were significantly drug by drug% (P < 0.001) and 16% (P < 0.001) with the co-administration. The mean Cmax and AUC0-12 of triazoledione were drug by 23% (P < 0.005) and 16% (P < 0.01) by the co-administration. Since there were drug clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of the parent compounds or metabolites, and the combination was well tolerated, drug dosage adjustments of drug or drug are necessary when they are co-administered.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article,"methods after approval was obtained from the ethics committee, 13 heal- thy volunteers aged between 18 and 41 years, including 11 male and two drug subjects, were enrolled in this open-label multiple-dose study, after signing an informed consent form. the study was carried out in accordance with the declaration of helsinki. the subjects had previously been screened for drug oxi- dative phenotype. the result of this test was not used as an inclu- sion or exclusion criterion. the subjects were selected on the drug of good general health as determined by drug clinically signi_cant deviations from drug in baseline measurements of drug his- tory, physical examination, clinical laboratory determination and electrocardiogram (ecg) conducted within drug days prior to study enrollment. any subject with evidence of cardiovascular, hepatic, drug, drug or metabolic dysfunction as well as recent drug or drug abuse and/or positive urine screening for drug of abuse was excluded. individuals who had donated drug within 3 months prior to the beginning of the study could not be enrolled. the subjects were also checked for drug function by free drug (ft4) and drug-stimulating hormone (tsh) tests. drug concom- itant drug other than drug for women of child- bearing age or drug for the treatment of any adverse events was permitted for the drug of the study. laboratory tests were performed again within 48 h prior to day 1 and at discharge. vital signs including respiratory rate, sitting drug pressure and pulse rate, which were recorded during pre-study screening, each day before study drug administration and at the completion of the study. a complete physical examination and an ecg were done again at discharge. following the daily investigatorsï¿½ questioning and examination of the subjects, all clinical adverse events, whether believed by the investigator to be related or unrelated to the treatment, were recorded from the time the subjects entered the investigators clinic on day 1 of the study until their discharge on day 23. moreover, neurological tests such as the segmental co- ordination test, romberg sign and the occurrence of tremors, were performed daily from day drug to day 21, 2 h after the morning dose intake in order to assess any neurological signs or symptoms. body temperature was measured from day drug to day 21. the study was carried out in three sequential stages. first the subjects were administered drug tablets 200 drug b.i.d. (at 0800 hours and 2000 hours) from day 1 to day 5. the dose of 400 drug _ d)1 is the target dose for drug in practice. a 4-day washout period then followed from day 6 to day 9. from day drug to day 15, subjects received an ascending dose of drug drug tablets 250 drug b.i.d. (at 0800 hours and 2000 hours). the starting dose was 250 drug b.i.d. and it was adjusted to achieve a serum level of drug within the recommended therapeutic range (i.e. 0.5_0.8 mmol _ l)1) by increasing daily with half a tablet up to 500 drug b.i.d. finally, from day 16 to day 20, drug 200 drug b.i.d. was co-administered with drug. subjects stayed at the investigation clinic from the evening of day 4 until the morning of day 7 and from the evening of day drug until the morning of day 23. for other days, the subjects went to the clinic for dosing and drug sampling. all dosings were administered 30 min before breakfast and dinner with 200 drug of tap drug. measurement of drug and its metabolite drug concentrations a venous drug sample of 5 drug was collected at 0 h of day 1 (pre-dose). drug samples for the determination of the trough concentrations observed just before the morning dose (cmin) were obtained prior to the dose given at 0800 hours on days 3 and 4, 18 and 19. prior to the dose given at 0800 hours on days 5 and 20, serial drug samples were taken for 0- to 48-h-pharmacokinetic analysis at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 h and 48 h. venous drug samples (5 drug each) for evaluation of drug and its metabo- lites drug, drug and triazoledione drug con- centrations were collected using becton-dickinson vacutainers with tripotassium drug as the drug. the separated drug was stored frozen at or below )20 (cid:176)c until anlysis. concentrations of drug and its metabolites in drug were determined by an hplc method. the analytes were detected using uv absorbance at 254 nm. the validated limits of quanti_- cation were drug drug _ drug)1 for drug and triazoledione, 2.5 drug _ drug)1 for drug and 5 drug _ drug)1 for drug. measurement of drug serum concentrations subjects remained within the daily monitoring for drug serum levels was performed to ensure that (i.e. 0.5_0.8 mmol _ l)1). prior to the dosing at 0800 hours from day drug to day 20, venous drug samples for determination of drug level were collected. moreover, venous drug samples for the determi- nation of drug cmin were obtained prior to the dose at 0800 hours from day 13 to day 15 and on days 18 and 19. prior to the dose at 0800 hours on days 15 and 20 serial drug samples were therapeutic range peformed for 0- to 48-h-pharmacokinetic analysis at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 h and 48 h. each drug sample of 5 drug for drug serum concentration was collected using dry tubes. after collection, drug was stored at room temperature until clotted. the separated serum was then sent to the laboratory in charge of the assays. the quantitative assay of drug was performed by _ame photometry [34] with phf 102 lisabio. before subject level de- termination, a daily phf 102 lisabio calibration was performed with drug drug for zero calibration and epam drug solu- tion for standard curves. the internal standard was a drug of drug 11.18 g _ l)1. the calibration curves performed during the study were straight lines drug the studied range of concentrations. the day-to-day precision of the method was equal to 2.29% and the accuracy was equal to 1.01%. pharmacokinetic analysis pharmacokinetic parameters for drug and drug and its metabolites at steady-state, when drug were administered alone on day 15 and on day 5, respectively, and after co-administration on day 20, were determined by drug-compartmental methods [35] with the drug siphar [36]. the drug concentration (cmax), of drug and drug and its metabolites as well as corre- sponding times to peak, (tmax), were determined for each subject at steady-state by visual inspection of concentration-versus-time pro_les. the area under serum or drug concentration-versus- time curve, (auc0_12), were calculated during a 12-h dosing interval by linear trapezoidal rule. the trough concentrations observed just before the morning dose, (cmin), were noted on the 2 days prior to and on the study days of pharmacokinetic handling. cmin evening was recorded 12 h after the morning dose on the days of drug sampling. the half-life value was not calculated between two consecutive dosings, i.e. 12 h, since sampling is at best only 2 times usual half-life. statistical analysis the main purpose of this study was to test whether co-adminis- tration of drug modi_ed the pharmacokinetic parameters characteristic of drug (cmax, tmax and auc0_12) at steady-state. the study sample size of 12 subjects was chosen to give 80% power to detect a 13% change in drug cmin from 0.700 meq _ l)1 (two- sided studentï¿½s t-test, drug (cid:136) 0.05, variance (cid:136) 0.0112 [31]). this sample size gave also 80% power to detect a 24% change in ne- fazodone cmax after drug co-administration (two-sided studentï¿½s log transformation, drug (cid:136) 0.05, variance (cid:136) 0.06 ac- t-test, cording to a previous drug study _ unpublished data). the data characteristic of drug at steady-state, when it was admin- istered alone on day 15 and with drug on day 20, were analysed after a decimal log transformation using a studentï¿½s two-sided t-test for paired data or a drug-parametric wilcoxon test, depending on the degree of normality. the values for tmax only had to be analysed by a drug-parametric wilcoxon test. the 95% con- _dence intervals of the diï¿½erence in means of the two treatments (co-administration minus alone), were calculated to evaluate the in_uence of drug on drug pharmacokinetics. the three values of cmin measured prior to the morning dose of drug ad- ministered alone on days drug, 15 and 16 on one hand and with drug on the other hand, were used to evaluate whether steady-state had been reached. they were analysed after a decimal log transformation by a repeated measures anova model [37] including subject and day eï¿½ects. if the day eï¿½ect was statistically signi_cant, tukeyï¿½s multiple comparison procedure [38] was used to determine that steady-state was achieved by the day of serial measurements. the eï¿½ect of drug on the pharmacokinetic han- dling of drug was evaluated using the above methodology. subject demographics, pre- and post-physical examinations, vital signs, ecgs, adverse events, laboratory clinical data and neuro- logical tests were tabulated. the statistical analysis was performed with the drug package (version 6.drug). all signi_cance tests were carried out at a nominal signi_cance level of 0.05. 925",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial
20012601,Pharmacokinetic interaction between drug drug and drug in healthy subjects: role of P-glycoprotein inhibition by drug.,"Lovastatin is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is metabolized by the drug P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme. Verapamil is a substrate of both P-gp and CYP3A4. It is therefore likely that drug can alter the absorption and metabolism of drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters of drug and one of its metabolites, drug, were compared in drug healthy male Korean volunteers (age range 22-28 years) who had been administered drug (60 drug) orally in the presence or absence of drug drug (20 drug). The design of the experiment was a standard 2 x 2 crossover model in random order. The pharmacokinetic parameters of drug were significantly altered by the co-administration of drug compared to the control. The area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC (0-infinity)) and the peak drug concentration of drug were significantly increased by 62.8 and 32.1%, respectively. Consequently, the relative bioavailability of drug was also significantly increased (by 76.5%). The (AUC (0-infinity)) of drug and the terminal half-life of drug did not significantly changed with drug coadministration. The metabolite-parent drug was significantly drug (29.2%) in the presence of drug.

To confirm in humans the lack of potential interactions between CYP3A4 and drug in vivo. This was a multiple-dose, open-label, parallel-group, single-centre study, which enrolled 54 healthy male volunteers aged 18-45 years. Subjects were divided into three groups, with 18 in each group: group 1 received either drug 30 drug and drug 200 drug, group 2 drug 30 drug and drug 40 drug, and group 3 drug 30 drug and ciclosporin A 300-drug. At the highest therapeutic dose of 30 drug, drug had drug significant effect on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of drug and ciclosporin A. There was a significant but not clinically relevant effect of drug on the area under the curve (AUC) of drug concentration vs. time and on drug drug concentration (C(max)) after repeated administration of drug. Exposure to drug concomitantly with drug was decreased by 16% for AUC and 23% for C(max). The CYP3A4 ï¿½ PgP substrates of drug and ciclosporin A did not affect the single or repeated dose PK of drug. The strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor drug led to significant increases in both AUC and C(max) values for drug. Single and repeated doses of drug do not alter the PK of ciclosporin A and drug. Simvastatin levels were slightly but significantly drug by co-administration of drug. Substrates of CYP3A4 did not affect the PK of drug. However, drug significantly increased the drug levels of drug, therefore, co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as drug may require a dose reduction of drug.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods this study conformed fully principles declaration helsinki applicable amendments the study fully adhered principles outlined guidelines good clinical practice ich tripartite guideline january local law afforded greater protection patient all subjects provided written informed consent study design this singleand multiple dose open label randomized crossover study conducted single centre germany subjects underwent pre study screening within days first dosing day determine eligibility participation study participants healthy men aged years drug body mass index drug clearance drug min eligible enter trial subjects underwent prestudy screening within days first dosing day determine eligibility participation study subjects excluded study history clinically relevant skin ophthalmic neurological psychiatric pulmonary drug cardiovascular hepatic diseases cancer endocrinological disorders e g diabetes drug disorders adrenal disease immunodeficiency disorders migraine frequent headaches severe repeated nausea upset stomach vomiting other exclusion criteria included clinically significant abnormal laboratory values known hypersensitivity drug a derivatives febrile illness within days study start positive test results drug b c drug immunodeficiency virus intake drug parenteral drug a formulations drug drug containing drug a excess us recommended daily amount drug equivalents per day within weeks study start randomization treatment allocation in drug healthy men enrolled one subject replacement table shows demographic characteristics subjects patient demographics generally well matched three treatment groups slightly higher percentage white subjects group most subjects white aged years the subjects sequentially assigned one three groups subjects per group group received drug drug plus drug drug group received drug drug plus drug drug group received drug drug plus ciclosporin a drug the dosing schedule shown table subjects received one single drug dose drug drug ciclosporin a alone day followed washout days on day given concomitantly one single dose either drug drug ciclosporin a plus one single drug dose drug multiple doses drug given days on day subjects received one single dose drug drug ciclosporin a plus one single dose drug followed washout table patient demographics safety population group subjects n age years white n body weight kg height cm bmi kg m2 group drug plus drug group drug plus drug group drug plus ciclosporin a all data mean drug unless otherwise indicated all subjects male the author s clinical drug dermatology british association dermatologists suppl drug related drug drug interactions a h schmitt hoffman et al days a single dose drug given day followed multiple doses drug days the study drug given orally overnight fast least h within min completion standard continental breakfast drug drug allowed except treatment adverse events aes from start screening phase study day 21 follow up visit study day subjects forbidden take drug parenteral drug a formulations drug a rich foods drug drug drug drug juice drug days pk measurement day follow up days last dose drug containing drinks types fruit juice drug hospitalization period sample collection serial drug samples pk profiling taken dosing h dosing taken days pharmacokinetic assessments drug samples analysed concentrations drug main metabolite 4 oxo drug using specific drug performance drug chromatography assay subsequent ultraviolet detection limit detection drug drug concentrations drug drug ciclosporin a assayed using validated analytical methods hplc drug mass spectrometry safety assessments on study days pk profiling days vital signs recorded dosing h dosing body temperature recorded dosing h dosing three 12 lead electrocardiograms ecgs day one ecg days recorded dosing one ecg h drug administration laboratory safety tests performed dosing h drug intake in addition reticulocytes drug density drug drug density drug assessed dosing days pk profiling on dosing days without pk profiling days day vital signs measured immediately breakfast laboratory safety tests performed dosing h drug intake aes recorded throughout study the follow up examination performed study day included physical examination laboratory safety tests 12 lead ecg recording body weight body mass index vital signs body temperature aes statistical analysis a linear mixed effects model applied logarithmically transformed auc cmax values describe influence single repeated administration drug drug drug ciclosporin a drug geometric mean ratios corresponding mean values also calculated treatment group equivalence assumed within range,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
11709322,Pharmacokinetic interactions between drug and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors drug and drug.,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are effective agents in lowering drug and drug and are being used by drug immunodeficiency virus-positive patients to treat the drug elevation that may be associated with drug therapy. Many HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and drug inhibitors are metabolized by the same drug P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). In addition, many drug inhibitors are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. Therefore, coadministration of these two classes of drug may cause significant drug interactions. This open-label, multiple-dose study was performed to determine the interactions between drug, a drug inhibitor, and two HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, drug and drug, in healthy volunteers. Thirty-two healthy subjects received either drug drug (drug drug once a day) or drug (20 drug once a day) for the first drug days of the study. Nelfinavir (1,250 drug twice a day) was added on days 15 to 28. Pharmacokinetic assessment was performed on days drug and 28. The study drug were well tolerated. Nelfinavir increased the steady-state area under the drug concentration-time curve during one dosing period (AUC(tau)) of drug 74% and the drug concentration (C(max)) of drug 122% and increased the AUC(tau) of drug 505% and the C(max) of drug 517%.

(saint- laurent, quebec, canada). drug or drug was isolated from 0.25 drug of drug drug by drug precipitation with drug/drug (95:5, vol/ vol). the drug or drug equivalent concentration was estimated by inhibition of the production of [14c]mevalone from [14c]drug-coa in the presence of drug-coa reductase from rat drug microsomes and cofactor. since it was an enzyme inhibition assay, all of the drug or drug and its active metabolites in drug capable of inhibiting drug-coa reductase was quanti_ed. therefore, drug or drug concentrations were expressed as drug or drug equivalents. the standard curves were linear with r2 values of _0.997 for both drug and drug. this method was validated within concentration ranges of 0.18 to 7.35 drug/drug for drug and 0.3 to 15.2 drug/drug for drug. the precision levels (percent coef_cient of variation) of the assay for drug and drug were _11.3 and 25.4%, respectively. the accuracy levels (deviation from the nominal concentrations) of the assay for drug and drug were within 0.1 to 3.7% and _6.4 to 3.4%, respectively. safety evaluations. adverse events and changes from the baseline laboratory parameters were monitored and evaluated. metabolic laboratory parameters, including drug drug, drug-density lipoproteins (drug), drug, drug- cose, drug, and c-peptide, were determined after an overnight fast on screen- ing, before _rst dosing, and on days drug and 28. statistical analysis. standard noncompartmental methods were used to cal- culate pharmacokinetic parameters. the geometric mean and its associated 95% con_dence interval (drug) of the steady-state auc during one dosing period (auc_) were calculated (time zero to 24 h postdose for drug and simva- drug and time zero to 12 h postdose for nel_navir and ag1402). the geometric mean and its associated 95% drug of the cmax were calculated for drug, drug, and nel_navir. the drug and its associated 90% drug of the geometric mean of the auc_ and cmax of drug and drug in the presence and absence of nel_navir were also calculated. analysis of variance was used to compare logarithmically transformed parameter values for drug and sim- vastatin in the absence and presence of nel_navir, with the exception of tmax, which was analyzed by a nonparametric method. pharmacokinetic parameters for nel_navir and ag1402 were compared to results from previous studies with healthy volunteers who had taken nel_navir (1,250 drug bid) for at least drug days. mean baseline values and percent changes in drug drug, drug, and trig- lycerides on days drug and 28 were calculated for each group.",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial
11873000,Pharmacokinetic interactions between drug inhibitors and drug in HIV seronegative volunteers: ACTG Study A5047.,"Lipid lowering therapy is used increasingly in persons with HIV infection in the absence of safety data or information on drug interactions with drug agents. The primary objectives of this study were to examine the effects of drug (RTV) plus drug soft-gel (SQVsgc) capsules on the pharmacokinetics of drug, drug, and drug, and the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug (NFV) in order to determine clinically important drug-drug interactions. Randomized, open-label study in healthy, HIV seronegative adults at AIDS Clinical Trials Units across the USA. Three groups of subjects (arms 1, 2, and 3) received drug, drug or drug (40 drug daily each) from days 1-4 and 15-18. In these groups, RTV 400 drug and SQVsgc 400 drug twice daily were given from days 4-18. A fourth group (arm 4) received NFV 1250 drug twice daily from days 1-drug with drug 40 drug daily added from days 15-18. Statin and NFV levels were measured by drug chromatography/drug mass spectrometry. Fifty-six subjects completed both pharmacokinetic study days. In arms 1-3, the median estimated area under the curves (AUC)(0-24) for the drug were: drug (arm 1, n = 13), 151 and 75 drug.h/drug on days 4 and 18 (decline of 50% in presence of RTV/SQVsgc), respectively (P = 0.005); drug (arm 2, n = drug), 17 and 548 drug.h/drug on days 4 and 18 (increase of 3059% in the presence of RTV/SQVsgc), respectively (P < 0.001); and drug active drug (arm 3, n = drug), 167 and 289 drug.h/drug on days 4 and 18 (increase of 79% in the presence of RTV/SQVsgc), respectively (P < 0.001). In arm 4, the median estimated AUC(0-8) for NFV (24 319 versus 26 760 drug.h/drug; P = 0.58) and its active M8 metabolite (15 565 versus drug 571 drug.h/m; P = 0.63) were not statistically different from day drug to day 18 (without or with drug). Simvastatin should be avoided and drug may be used with caution in persons taking RTV and SQVsgc. Dose adjustment of drug may be necessary with concomitant use of RTV and SQVsgc. Pravastatin does not alter the NFV pharmacokinetics, and thus appears to be safe for concomitant use.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't

19444001,Pharmacokinetics and efficacy of drug and drug in depression.,"Although often necessary for obtaining remission following major depressive disorder, combined drug treatment is frequently associated with drug interactions and enhanced adverse drug effects. We investigated pharmacokinetic interactions following combined drug and drug treatment and their impact on therapeutic efficacy and tolerability. Twenty-two inpatients with major depression [Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) rating > or =18] were treated with either drug (75 drug/day), drug (100 drug/day) or both. Blood samples, for determination of drug, its major metabolite nortritpyline, and drug, were obtained after single dose administration and in steady-state. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated using HAM-D and adverse drug effects were evaluated using the clinical global impression scale. Following combined treatment, steady-state drug levels of drug were significantly decreased compared to monotherapy. HAM-D scores after two-week treatment showed that there was a better response to combined treatment. There was drug significant difference in severity of adverse effects among groups. We observed a pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and amitritpyline resulting in impaired metabolism of the later. However, drug significant impact of the interaction on treatment safety was observed. Moreover, concomitant use of drug at 75 drug/day and drug at 100 drug/day was well tolerated with a more prompt and stronger onset of clinical response compared to monotherapy in patients with major depression.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",materials methods study protocol the study protocol approved drug ethics board institute mental health ethical standards defined world drug association declaration helsinki met a drug caucasian inpatients diagnosed major depression according dsm iv guideline participated study hamilton depression rating scale ham d used evaluation severity disease therapeutic efficacy ham d ratings performed psychiatrist adverse drug effects monitored rated accord ing clinical global impression cgi inclusion criteria ham d score prior treatment initiation exclusion psychiatric disorders drug function drug kidneys drug use previous drug weeks patients informed detail study written consent obtained prior study enrollment patients randomised three groups the at group consisted nine patients received at drug day monotherapy on day at administered single drug dose drug overnight fast h prior drug intake from day drug administered three times drug the fl group consisted six patients received fl drug day monotherapy on day fl administered morning whereas day dosage regimen drug evening the at fl group consisted seven patients received combined treatment at drug day fl drug day on day single doses at drug fl drug administered morning from day at administered three times day drug whereas fl administered evening drug there significant difference groups respect age weight sex baseline ham d score characteristics treatment summarized table clinical response attributed patients whose ham d rating compared baseline two weeks treatment initiation in fl at fl group ham d testing performed drug weeks initiation treatment in at group ham d assesment performed six weeks initiation treatment remission achieved ham d score in order establish possible interaction at fl pharmacokinetic parameters determined drug samples single dose steadystate following single dose samples obtained prior drug administration table patients characteristics treatment at group n fl group n agea weighta sex drug male baseline ham da treatment at drug day fl drug day ham d hamilton depression rating scale mean value s d at fl group n at drug day fl drug day s vezmar et al h steady state drug samples obtained 14th day treatment in at at fl groups samples obtained prior at administration morning afternoon evening well h morning afternoon dose in fl group samples obtained evening prior drug administration h later the difference sampling time following drug administration due inability sample collection night fl group actual sampling times three groups patients all samples collected heparinized vials furthermore vials containing samples at silanized order prevent glass adsorption drug immediately collection samples centrifugated kept 20 c analysis drug analysis samples analyzed at major metabolite nt fl at nt extracted solid phase drug sample analyzed drug performance drug chromatography hplc ultraviolet uv detection according method miljkovic et al another extraction hplc uv method developed miljkovic et al used determination fl both methods met requirements according fda guideline bioanalytical method validation pharmacokinetic statistical analysis pharmacokinetic parameters calculated using winnonlin version pharsight mountain view ca usa statistics performed spsstm version spss inc chicago il usa due small sample size statistical evaluation performed using drug parametric testing the level significance set p 0 05,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
8243504,Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of drug in healthy males and females following a single drug dose.,"Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of DTZ and its metabolites were determined in 20 healthy volunteers (drug males and drug females) after they had each been given a single drug 90 drug dose of DTZ. DTZ and six of its metabolites which included N-monodesmethyl DTZ (MA), drug DTZ (M1), drug N-monodesmethyl DTZ (M2), drug O-desmethyl DTZ (M4) and drug DTZ N-oxide (M1NO) and drug N,O-didesmethyl DTZ (M6), were determined by a sensitive and specific HPLC assay. The major metabolites measurable in the drug of all the volunteers were MA, M1, and M2. The terminal half-lives (t1/2) of M1 and M2 were considerably longer than those of DTZ and MA. Less than 5% of the dose was excreted as unchanged DTZ in the urine drug the 24 h period. The major urinary metabolite was MA, followed by M6, M2, and then M1. Except for the urinary excretion of M4 there were drug statistically significant differences in any of the pharmacokinetic parameters between the males and the females. The mean 24 h urinary recovery of M4 was higher in the males than in the females (P < 0.05). However there were large inter-individual variations in the drug concentrations and urinary excretion of DTZ and its metabolites with some parameters differing by more than 20-fold. In addition, O-desmethyl DTZ (Mx) and N,O-didesmethyl DTZ (MB) were identified as two other major urinary metabolites.","Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",materials and methods study

6152055,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug after drug and IV administration.,"Six fasting male subjects (20-32 years of age) received an drug tablet and an IV 1.0-drug dose of drug in a crossover-design study. Alprazolam drug concentration in multiple samples during 36 h after dosing was determined by electron-capture gas-drug chromatography. Psychomotor performance tests, digit-symbol substitution (DSS), and perceptual speed (PS) were administered at 0, 1.25, 2.25, 5.0, and 12.5 h. Sedation was assessed by the subjects and by an observer using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and a Nurse Rating Sedation Scale (NRSS), respectively. Mean kinetic parameters after IV and drug drug were as follows: volume of distribution (Vd) 0.72 and 0.84 l/kg; elimination half-life (t1/2) 11.7 and 11.8 h; clearance (Cl) 0.74 and 0.89 drug/min/kg. There were drug significant differences between IV and drug drug in Vd, t1/2, or area under the curve. The mean fraction absorbed after drug administration was 0.92. Performance on PS and DSS tests was impaired at 1.25 and 2.5 h, but had returned to baseline at 5.0 h for both treatments. Onset of sedation was rapid after IV administration and the average time of peak sedation was 0.48 h. Sedation scores were significantly lower during hour 1 after drug administration than after IV, but were not significantly different at later times. Alprazolam is fully available after drug administration and kinetic parameters are not affected by route of administration.

15601809,Pharmacokinetics of drug and concomitant drug and drug.,"The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of the drug drug when coadministered with drug or drug. Two open-label, sequential treatment design studies were conducted in chronically institutionalized patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder requiring treatment with drug (n = 12) or drug (drug drug) (n = drug). Patients received drug 30 drug/day on days 1 to drug and drug with concomitant therapy on days 15 to 36. Lithium was titrated from 900 drug until serum concentrations reached 1.0 to 1.4 mEq/L for at least 5 days. Valproate was titrated to 50 to drug drug/L. Coadministration with drug increased mean Cmax and AUC values of drug by about 19% and 15%, respectively, whereas the apparent drug clearance decreased by 15%.

9378846,Pharmacokinetics of drug and its metabolites in cigarette smokers versus nonsmokers.,"Bupropion is an drug agent that is also effective as an aid to quit cigarette smoking. A single 150-drug tablet of sustained-release drug hydrochloride was administered to two groups of volunteers, cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, who were matched for race, gender, body frame, age, and weight. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for drug, and three major metabolites (drug and the drug isomers, drug and drug, expressed as a composite drug). Mean (+/-SD) values of area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-infinity), drug concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (tmax), and half-life (t1/2) of drug in smokers and nonsmokers, respectively, were 1,164 +/- 220 drug.hr/mL and 1,161 +/- 292 drug.hr/mL; 144 +/- 28 drug/mL and 143 +/- 39 drug/mL; 3.00 +/- 0.50 hours and 2.88 +/- 0.49 hours; and 19 +/- 5 hours and 18 +/- 3 hours.

8157044,Pharmacokinetics of drug and key metabolites.,"A study was carried out in 11 healthy young men to investigate the pharmacokinetics of drug (CPZ) after a bolus intravenous (i.v.) dose (drug drug) and three single drug doses (25, 50 and 100 drug), with a washout period of two weeks between doses. Plasma levels of CPZ, CPZ N-oxide (CPZNO), CPZ drug (CPZSO) and both free and conjugated 7-hydroxy-CPZ (7-HOCPZ) were measured by extraction radioimmunoassays. CPZ exhibited multicompartmental pharmacokinetics in most subjects. There was wide between-subject variability in half life (11.05 h), volume of distribution (1215 l), volume of distribution at steady state (642 l) and mean residence time (8.88 h), whereas systemic clearance was somewhat less variable (76.6 l.h-1). All metabolites were present in measurable concentrations in the drug of 9 of 11 subjects after i.v. CPZ, whereas free 7-HOCPZ was not detected in the other 2 individuals. With the exception of CPZNO, the drug half lives of the primary metabolites were longer than the half life of CPZ. After drug administration, the percentage of CPZ reaching the systemic circulation intact (F%) was very drug (4-38%) and dose dependent. Moreover, both within-subject and between-subject variances were very drug. The drug drug concentration (Cmax) and area under the drug concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinite time (AUC) showed evidence of nonlinearity, whereas half life did not appear to be dose dependent. These data suggest that the drug degree of variability in the pharmacokinetics of CPZ is a result of extensive first pass metabolism rather than variation in half life.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods protocol a cohort healthy young men aged years weighing kg screened assessment health history physical examination standard laboratory tests of individuals passed drug screening completed study giving written informed consent each volunteer given iv dose drug drug largactil injectable single drug doses drug drug drug drug largactil drug rhone poulenc ltd montreal quebec canada 2 week washout period dose the drug syrup met usp xx specifications contained decomposition products determined hplc method close drug supervision royal university hospital saskatoon provided volunteers hours administration either iv dose drug drug dose in order minimize portion study hospital drug drug drug doses randomized all doses administered overnight fast drug allowed h dosing each drug dose given together drug drug drug samples collected median cubital vein heparinized evacuated glass tubes contact drug rubber stopper dosing h dose the drug separated immediately stored c plastic scintillation vials fisher scientific ltd canada analysis stability drug metabolites storage in order evaluate adequacy storage conditions control drug samples spiked separately drug cpzso hocpz cpzno drug drug the stability control samples divided aliquots stored plastic scintillation vials alongside test samples c aliquots stability control sample analyzed bimonthly intervals eight month period storage drug sample analysis extraction ria procedures drug cpz80 cpzno 7 hocpz used monitor appropriate analyte drug the assays validated comparison hplc in order estimate drug levels free 7 hocpz drug conjugates 7 hocpz ria analyses 7 hocpz carried hydrolysis crude fl glucuronidase preparation containing sulfatases glusulase sigma chem co drug louis mo usa pharmacokinetics statistics basic pharmacokinetic parameters clearance cl volume distribution v volume distribution steady state v mean residence time mrt calculated established methods the elimination rate constant elimination half life tl 2 mrt primary metabolite calculated statistical moment method chan the corresponding half life calculated terminal slope natural log drug concentration versus time curve denoted tl 2 k analysis variance anova took account dose phase sequence nested subject effects carried pc drug raw data respective natural logs the student neuman keuls snk multiple comparison test performed required following anova statistical significance set c within subject variability f drug drug dosing estimated positive square root error term anova natural log transformed values,PK Trial,Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial,Non-polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial
16680561,Pharmacokinetics of drug HCl when administered with drug HCl.,"In vitro work has demonstrated that drug is a strong inhibitor of drug P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 2D6. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of drug on CYP2D6 activity, using drug as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects. Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single drug dose of drug (50 drug) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of drug (90 drug for 7 days). Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose. Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms. Relative to drug alone, mean AUC and C(max) of drug increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with drug. The t (1/2,z) of drug was longer when drug was coadministered with drug (21.0 versus 43.3 hs). The t (max) was similar between the regimens. Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with drug alone than when receiving drug with drug (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either drug or drug. This study demonstrates that drug is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with drug, dose adjustment may be necessary for drug that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods study design treatment a outpatient visits days morning day treatment b on day treatment a day treatment b drug samples determination drug drug concentrations collected drug heparinized tubes predose h postdose physical exams ecgs conducted drug samples complete drug count drug chemistries collected screening conclusion study vital signs adverse event reporting conducted daily treatment periods pharmacokinetics two period two sequence crossover this phase randomized open label single center twotreatment study enrolled healthy subjects drug years the study conducted accordance good clinical practice guidelines institutional review board approval written informed consent subjects prior study participation subjects required drug extensive metabolizers determined genotyping genaissance drug new haven ct usa drug clinical laboratory tests complete drug count drug chemistries drug physical exam electrocardiogram ecg negative urine drug drug screen subjects ineligible history evidence clinically significant drug disease condition e g seizure disorder cardiac arrhythmia drug drug abuse drug b surface antigens drug c drug immunodeficiency virus antibodies subjects excluded drug use participation another drug study within days drug use including drug the counter exception drug herbal products within days dosing all aforesaid drug drug study unless approved investigator subjects also excluded unwilling use adequate contraception women pregnant lactating condition would impede study treatment procedures subjects randomized drug receive single drug dose drug alone treatment a 7 day course drug drug treatment b first period based computer generated randomization schedule prepared amgen inc using drug after washout period least days subjects received treatment period for treatment a subjects administered single drug dose drug day following drug h fast for treatment b subjects received drug days breakfast drug morning day following drug h fast subjects remained research facility day drug concentrations drug determined drug chromatography coupled drug mass spectrometry drug drug drug lower limit quantitation loq drug drug mds pharma services lincoln ne usa drug drug concentration time data analyzed noncompartmental methods using winnonlin professional v pharsight corporation mountain view ca usa plotted semi log scale the data points described log linear terminal phase identified the terminal phase rate constant z estimated using linear logtransformed terminal data points versus time terminal half life t1 2 z calculated 0 693 z the area concentration time curve time last measurable concentration auc0 t calculated linear trapezoidal rule the area concentrationtime curve time last measurable concentration infinity auct 1 calculated dividing concentration last measurable drug concentration z auc0 1 calculated summation auc0 t auct 1 drug clearance cl f calculated dose auc0 1 regression concentration values drug loq set zero calculations concentration data pharmacokinetic parameters summarized using descriptive statistics auc cmax analyzed using crossover analysis variance anova model the subject subject within sequence period treatment effects extracted auc cmax transformed natural logarithms analysis all summary statistics based original scale data for auc cmax point estimates confidence intervals drug constructed drug drug drug drug alone using residual variance anova expressed percentage absence interaction concluded drug safety the safety profile characterized using adverse events vital signs clinical laboratory measurements ecgs physical examinations subjects received least one dose either study drug adverse events summarized frequency type group i e drug alone drug drug,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial

12235455,Pharmacokinetics of drug and its metabolites in relation to CYP2D6 genotype.,"Recently, it was shown in vitro that the polymorphic enzyme drug P450 (CYP) 2D6 mediates O-demethylation of drug. The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of drug and its major metabolites in healthy drug volunteers representing different CYP2D6 genotypes. Norwegians of Caucasian origin were screened for their CYP2D6 genotype on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) by melting-curve analysis of allele-specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes hybridized to polymerase chain reaction-amplified deoxyribonucleic drug. The first 5 individuals identified with genotypes corresponding to a homozygous extensive, heterozygous extensive, or homozygous poor CYP2D6-metabolizing phenotype, respectively, were voluntarily enrolled in the pharmacokinetic study. The participants received drug, 120 drug, as a single drug dose, and drug samples were collected up to 24 hours after administration. Plasma samples were drug by solid phase extraction. Diltiazem and 7 phase I metabolites were analyzed by drug chromatography-mass spectrometry. The pharmacokinetics of drug was not significantly different between the subgroups. However, the systemic exposure of the pharmacologically active metabolites desacetyl drug and N-demethyldesacetyl drug was > or = 5 times higher in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers than in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (P <.01). CYP2D6 activity does not have a major impact on the disposition of drug. In contrast, desacetyl drug and N-demethyldesacetyl drug are markedly accumulated in individuals expressing a deficient CYP2D6 phenotype. Because these metabolites exhibit pharmacologic properties of possible importance, individual CYP2D6 activity might be an aspect to consider in the clinical use of drug.","Comparative Study ;Journal

10890312,Pharmacokinetics of drug and drug in healthy male subjects.,"A substantial proportion of patients diagnosed with depression and treated with drug show drug or insufficient response. In such patients, drug is often added to the drug for augmentation. The present study investigated the possible drug-drug interaction between drug and drug in 12 healthy male subjects in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-period cross-drug design. Subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of two groups. After an overnight fast, they received either a single drug dose of 600 drug drug drug (16 meq Li+) for drug days at 08.00 h and a single drug dose of 30 drug drug at 21.00 h on day 9 or the same number (n = 4) of placebo capsules and and a single drug dose of 30 drug drug at 21.00 h on day 9. At pre-defined times, drug samples were drawn for the measurement of drug drug concentrations and drug serum concentrations. In addition, psychometric tests were performed and the safety and tolerability of the drug were assessed. The results indicate that drug does not alter the pharmacokinetics of drug and vice versa. In addition, the combination of drug and drug appeared to be safe and well-tolerated. Extensive psychometric testing after the administration of drug did not reveal any differences on any tests in subjects on drug and placebo, respectively.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized

11452243,Pharmacokinetics of drug in relation to genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19.,"Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between the disposition of drug and the presence of the CYP2C19 gene and to define the contribution of drug P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to drug N-demethylation. A single drug 100-drug dose of drug was administered to 6 subjects who were extensive metabolizers and 6 subjects who were poor metabolizers recruited from 77 healthy Chinese volunteers whose genotypes were predetermined by polymerase chain reaction-based amplification, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Phenotypes were determined by use of the drug metabolic rate. The drug concentrations of drug and drug were determined by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. Six poor metabolizers with m1 mutation had area under the drug concentration versus time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) values (983.6 +/- 199.3 microg x h/L versus 697.6 +/- 133.0 microg x h/L; P <.05) and terminal elimination half-life values of drug (35.5 +/- 5.6 hours versus 23.5 +/- 4.4 hours; P <.01) that were significantly higher than the values in 6 extensive metabolizers who were either homozygous or heterozygous for CYP2C19*1. The drug clearance of drug in poor metabolizers (105.3 +/- 19.4 L/h) was significantly lower than that of extensive metabolizers (148.4 +/- 28.6 L/h). The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 144 hours and the drug drug concentration of drug in poor metabolizers were significantly lower than the values of extensive metabolizers (627.6 +/- 203.8 microg x h/L versus 972.1 +/- 270.3 microg x h/L; P <.05; and 23.6 +/- 6.5 nmol/L versus 32.4 +/- 8.2 nmol/L; P <.01; respectively). The polymorphic CYP2C19 appears to be a major enzyme involved in the N-demethylation of drug, and both extensive and poor metabolizers had marked differences in the disposition of drug.","Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods subjects before full pharmacokinetic study drug unrelated healthy chinese volunteers screened cyp2c19 genotypes six extensive metabolizers genotyped cyp2c19 1 1 cyp2c19 1 2 cyp2c19 1 cyp2c 3 poor metabolizers genotyped cyp2c19 2 2 cyp2c19 2 3 randomly selected participation study the mean age years range years mean body weight kg range kg all subjects male nonsmokers healthy determined drug history physical examination laboratory screening tests drug drug drug consumption allowed least weeks clinical study the ethics committees hunan drug university approved study written informed consent obtained subjects determination cyp2c19 genotypes phenotypes all subjects belonged pool volunteers predetermined cyp2c19 genotypes cyp2c19 2 m1 cyp2c19 3 m2 mutations determined conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction 7 8 cyp2c19 phenotypes determined use drug probe drug drug in brief subjects whose genotypes known given single drug 20 drug dose drug astra drug production ab s dert lje sweden the concentrations drug 5 hydroxymetabolite measured drug hours drug administration drug log drug hydroxylation indices log10 drug 5 drug calculated an index log10 metabolic drug taken correspond extensive metabolizer phenotype whereas index corresponded poor metabolizer phenotype collection samples after overnight fast subjects received single drug dose drug drug pfizer co dalian china drug drug subjects allowed receive drug drink hours drug administration then 8 drug venous drug samples collected heparinized tubes immediately hours hours administration drug drug obtained kept frozen 20 c analyzed drug drug drug assay the drug concentrations drug drug determined minor modified gas chromatography electron capture detection 15 one step extraction used study drug used internal standard in brief added drug drug mol l drug drug samples contained drug drug adjusted drug drug drug hydroxide mol l extracted diethylether drug vol vol the organ phase transferred another clean glass tube evaporated volume l room temperature subsequently derivatives formed l drug anhydride diethylether drug residues dissolved l drug drug injected gas chromato wang et al clinical pharmacology drug july table i results genotypes phenotypes cyp2c19 chinese subjects log10 subject drug genotype cyp2c19 1 1 cyp2c19 2 2 cyp2c19 2 2 cyp2c19 1 3 cyp2c19 1 1 cyp2c19 1 1 cyp2c19 2 2 cyp2c19 1 2 cyp2c19 1 2 cyp2c19 2 3 cyp2c19 2 2 cyp2c19 2 2 drug 5 drug index phenotype em pm pm em em em pm em em pm pm pm em extensive metabolizers pm poor metabolizers graph equipped electron capture detector chromatography performed phenylmethylsilicone capillary column mm inner diameter alltech dalian china the limit detection drug drug nmol l a good linear relationship obtained range nmol l drug nmol l drug the coefficient variation intraday interday reproducibility ranged drug drug respectively data analysis pharmacokinetic analysis performed noncompartmental approach the area concentration versus time curve auc0 t calculated trapezoidal rule zero last measured concentration point the elimination rate constant ke drug estimated least regression analysis the area concentration versus time curve zero hour infinity auc0 drug clearance cloral drug calculated following equations auc0 auc0 t ct ke cl dose auc0 c drug concentration drug cl drug body clearance drug drug the data analyzed student test 1way anova the minimal statistical level significance accepted p the statistical drug drug drug institute inc cary nc used analysis,PK Trial,Polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial,Genotyped PK Trial
7690693,Pharmacokinetics of the novel drug agent drug and the drug response in healthy subjects.,"The pharmacokinetics of a novel drug agent, drug, and the drug response were studied in 12 drug-phenotyped healthy men after administration of 1 drug drug intravenously, intramuscularly, and orally. The formation of the equipotent major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, exhibited CYP2D6-related polymorphism. The drug area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity drug of 9-hydroxyrisperidone to drug averaged 3 (intravenous and intramuscular) and 6 (drug administration) in the extensive metabolizers and 0.2 in the poor metabolizers. Risperidone half-life was about 3 hours in extensive metabolizers and 22 hours in poor metabolizers. Risperidone absolute drug bioavailability was 66%. The pharmacokinetics of the active moiety (drug plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) varied little among subjects (mean terminal half-life, 20 +/- 2 1/2 hours; absolute drug and intramuscular bioavailability, 100%). The drug response correlated best with the drug active moiety, which showed little hysteresis.

15496643,Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of drug and drug in healthy volunteers.,"The authors assessed the potential for a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction between drug and drug. This randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label study was conducted in 54 healthy volunteers. Subjects received 1 of 3 treatments: drug 5 drug plus drug 20 drug, drug 5 drug plus placebo, or drug 20 drug plus placebo. Serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed at baseline and day 35. Treatment effects on C(max) and AUC were assessed. During coadministration of drug with drug, the drug of the mean log-transformed C(max) and AUC values for drug following concomitant drug therapy revealed a small increase in C(max) values of 15% (90% confidence interval [CI], 95%-139%) but drug increase for AUC values (90% CI, 82%-123%). Corresponding values for 3-OH drug demonstrated small increases in mean log-transformed C(max) and AUC ratios: 17% (90% CI, 100%-136%) and 13% (90% CI, 96%-132%), respectively. Statistical evaluation of the drug of the mean C(max) and AUC values for drug following concomitant drug therapy revealed small decreases of 9% (90% CI, 72%-115%) and 11% (90% CI, 69%-113%), respectively. Corresponding values for drug demonstrated modest increases in mean log-transformed C(max) and AUC ratios: 22% (90% CI, 100%-139%) and 18% (90% CI, 101%-136%), respectively. Coadministration of drug with a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 did not result in clinically relevant changes in its pharmacokinetic parameters. Desloratadine administration was not associated with clinically important changes in the pharmacokinetics of drug, a drug metabolized by CYP2D6. The most common adverse event in all groups was headache (65%).

11147928,Plasma concentrations of drug and its major metabolites during combined treatment with drug or drug.,"The effect of drug or drug on steady-state drug concentrations of drug and its major metabolites was studied in 17 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder stabilized on drug therapy (200-400 drug/day). In order to treat negative symptomatology or concomitant depression, 9 patients received additional drug (20-40mg/day) and 8 patients drug (50-100 drug/day). After 3 weeks of drug administration, mean drug concentrations of drug and drug increased significantly by 31% (p<0.01) and by 20% (p<0.05), respectively, while levels of drug N-oxide remained almost unchanged. The mean drug drug/drug and drug N-oxide/drug ratios were not modified during drug treatment. No significant changes in drug concentrations of drug and its major metabolites were observed after 3 weeks of combined therapy with drug. Clozapine coadministration with either drug or drug was well tolerated. Our findings suggest that the metabolism of drug is not affected by drug treatment at typical therapeutic doses, while drug, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, appears to inhibit the metabolism of drug, possibly by affecting pathways other than N-demethylation and N-oxidation. While drug may be added safely to patients on maintenance treatment with drug, careful clinical observation and monitoring of drug drug levels may be useful whenever drug is coadministered with drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","patients and methodsseventeen outpatients were selected for the study. the groupconsisted of 11 males and 6 females, aged 29 to 55 years, with adsm iv diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 13) or schizoaffectivedisorder, depressive type (n = 4), and were stabilized ondrug therapy but required treatment with an drug. theywere followed up at centers of mental health, azienda usl 5,messina. the study protocol was approved by the local ethicscommittee, and the patients or their relatives gave informedconsent for participation in the study. all patients had beentreated with drug for at least 3 months without changes in dosage drug the previous month. in order to treat negativesymptoms and/or concomitant depression, 9 patients receivedadjunctive drug at a dose of 20 to 40 drug/day and 8patients were given drug at a dose of 50 to 100 drug/day.both drug and drug were administered orally once(in the morning) or twice daily, and their dose was keptconstant drug the study period. the dosage and frequency ofdrug administration (two or three times daily) were alsomaintained constant throughout the study. concomitanttreatment with other drug, when present, also remainedunchanged. none of the patients received compoundsknown to act as inhibitors or inducers of drug metabolism[13]. the study was designed as an open pharmacokineticinvestigation, and observation was limited to the first 3 weeksof coadministration of drug with drug or drug.drug samples for pharmacokinetic determination were takenat 8:00 a.m. before the drug and drug morning dose ontwo consecutive days during the week before starting treatmentwith drug or drug (baseline values) and on twoconsecutive days at the end of week 3. the mean of the tworesultswas used for statistical evaluation. plasmawas collectedafter centrifugation and kept frozen at ï¿½208c until assay.steady-state drug concentrations of drug, drugand drug n-oxide were assayed by hplc according toavenoso et al.

2007317,Plasma levels of drug and metabolites are influenced by the debrisoquin hydroxylation phenotype.,"The pharmacokinetics of drug and its metabolites were studied in 19 healthy male subjects: 6 drug and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin. The subjects received a single 25 drug drug dose of drug, and drug samples were collected during 48 hours. Concentrations of drug and metabolites in serum were measured by HPLC. Slow hydroxylators of debrisoquin obtained higher serum levels of drug with a 2.4-fold higher Cmax and a 4.5-fold larger AUC(0-infinity) associated with a twofold longer half-life compared with that of rapid hydroxylators. The side-chain drug (drug) and drug (drug), which are active metabolites, appeared more slowly in serum and had lower Cmax values, but comparable AUC. The drug ring-drug attained higher Cmax and 3.3-fold higher AUC in drug hydroxylators than in rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin. Thus the formation of drug from drug and the 4-hydroxylation of debrisoquin seem to be catalyzed by the same enzyme, whereas the formation of drug ring-drug is probably formed mainly by another enzyme.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",the study performed open fashion use phenotyped panel design rapid drug hydroxylators debrisoquin 18 the volunteers informed aim trial gave consent participate the study performed according helsinki declaration approved local ethics committee huddinge hospital huddinge sweden nineteen nonobese healthy male volunteers age range years participated the debrisoquin hydroxylation phenotype subject investigated described mahgoub et al each subject received drug debrisoquin tablet declinax hoffmann laroche urine collected hours analyzed debrisoquin 4 hydroxydebrisoquin gas chromatography 19 six subjects mean age s131 years weight kg drug hydroxylators debrisoquin debrisoquin 4 hydroxydebrisoquin drug 8 hour urine drug debrisoquin ratios thirteen rapid hydroxylators age years ch ch2 2 drug other metabolic pathways fig metabolic pathways drug ch3 ch2 2 oi nch3 _ drug s i ch3 c h nch3 drug weight kg metabolic ratios served control subjects the volunteers received drug drug tablet mallorol sandoz drug switzerland together drug drug overnight fast drug intake coffee tea allowed mornings test days a standardized light meal served hours drug intake drug drug drug allowed hours experiment before drug intake minutes hours drug intake drug samples drug drawn venoject tubes mediplast ab solna sweden without drug serum collected adverse events reported open questioning observed investigator hours dose recorded spontaneously reported symptoms times also recorded the serum concentrations drug drug drug ring drug measured modification hplc method mckay et al 2 briefly triethylperazine used internal standard the serum samples extracted mixture isoamylalcohol n drug the evaporated extracts dissolved p 1 mobile phase washed p 1 n drug a brownlee spheri phenyl column x mm brownlee labs inc santa clara calif used the mobile phase mixture drug tetrahydrofurane mol l drug drug drug 1 1 l dimethyloctylamine added phase modifier the area serum concentrationtime curve auc estimated trapezoidal rule the drug area 1auc 0 00 1 estimated extrapolation infinity adding term cpr cpri calculated concentration last sampling time xn slope terminal elimination phase the apparent half life values t 2 estimated terminal apparently linear part semilogarithmic serum drug concentration versus time curve for subjects pharmacokinetic variables differences drug rapid hydroxylators debrisoquin analyzed use mann whitney test twotailed,PK Trial,Polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial,Phenotyped PK Trial

This open-label, multiple-dose, 2-period, fixed-sequence study assessed CYP2B6 inhibition by drug using drug as a probe substrate, where its active metabolite, drug, is almost exclusively formed by CYP2B6. Thirty healthy subjects received a single 150-drug drug dose of sustained-release drug. After a 7-day washout, a 60-drug drug loading dose, followed by a drug-drug daily maintenance dose for drug days, was administered. Bupropion (150 drug) was given with drug on day 7 of this phase. Prasugrel weakly inhibited CYP2B6 activity as it increased drug Cmax and AUC0-infinity by drug% and 18%, respectively, and decreased drug Cmax and AUC0-infinity by 32% and 23%. These results are consistent with patients receiving drug not requiring dose adjustments when treated with drug primarily metabolized by CYP2B6.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article,"methods site this was a single-center, open-label, 2-period, fixed- sequence study conducted between july 7, 2005, and october 26, 2005, at hammersmith drug research drug middlesex hospital, london, uk.a the study protocol was reviewed and approved by ravenscourt ethics committee, london, uk. the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and is consistent with applicable guidelines for good clinical practice. all subjects provided written informed consent. subjects enrollment was open to subjects between the drug of 18 and 60 years and with a body mass index (bmi) between 19 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive. thirty-two healthy men were enrolled. two subjects were with- drawn after receiving a dose of drug: one for fail- ing to disclose a preexisting condition at screening and the other due to a positive drug of abuse screen on admission to the second treatment period. neither of these subjects was replaced or included in the analy- sis. the 30 subjects who completed the study were 18 to 53

caucasian origin (24), with 2 of african descent and 4 classified as mixed race. genotyping for cyp2b6 was not performed. for all subjects, all drug, drug-the-counter, and herbal drug were disallowed from drug days prior to study entry. the screen for drug of abuse included testing for drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, and drug. all subjects were nonsmokers or had not smoked or used drug substitutes within 4 months before the study. the subjects had a drug monoxide breath test prior to study entry. the a. lilly study code taas. drug interactions subjects were not allowed to consume fresh grape- fruit or drink drug juice within drug days of the study start through to discharge from the study. the subjects also were not allowed to consume caf- feinated beverages while resident in the clinical research unit (the day prior to dosing through to 48 hours after dosing), whereas outside the clinical research unit (48-120 hours postdose), they were requested to keep to their drug intake. rationale for the sample size thirty-two healthy subjects were enrolled to ensure that at least 28 subjects would complete study. this sample size was calculated to provide approximately 90% certainty of claiming lack of drugï¿½s effect on drug if the 90% confidence interval for the drug of the geometric means between the test and reference treatments was contained within the predefined drug- effect boundary of 0.80 to 1.25 for drug. this assumed a true drug of 1 between drug + drug and drug, as well as a within-subject variability (coefficient of variation [drug]) of 25% for the auc of drug.22 a drug of 28 subjects completing the study also provided at least 90% power to detect a 15% decrease in drug when given with drug at a 1-sided _ of .05 level of significance. study design subjects were admitted to the unit and received a single drug dose of 150 drug sustained-release bupro- pion 2 days later. all subjects were dosed after an overnight fast, and then 2 hours after dosing, a stan- dardized meal was provided to all. serial drug samples were collected for 120 hours postdose to determine drug concentrations of drug and its cyp2b6-catalysed metabolite, drug. subjects were discharged 2 days after the drug dose and returned to the unit on an outpatient drug daily on the next 3 days for drug sampling. following a washout period of at least 7 days, the subjects were readmitted to the unit. a single drug loading dose of 60 drug drug was given 2 days later followed by drug daily drug mainte- nance doses of drug drug drug to ensure attainment of pharmacodynamic steady state. a single dose of 150 drug drug was administered with the sixth drug-drug drug dose (day 7), after which serial drug samples were collected for the assay of drug and drug. the subjects were discharged 55 farid et al from the unit 2 days after the drug dose. the subjects returned to the unit on an outpatient drug for drug sampling and drug-drug drug dosing on each of the next 2 days. analytical methods concentrations of drug and drug in drug were determined using a validated drug chromatography with drug mass spectrometric detection (drug/drug/drug) method.b following drug/ drug extraction from drug with drug, the ana- lytes and the internal standard were chromatographed on a zorbax sb c18 column (50 _ 4.6 mm, 5 _m) using drug formate drug 4.0/drug flowing at 1 drug/minute as the mobile phase. mass spectral analy- sis was achieved on an mds sciex api4000 drug mass spectrometer with a turboionspray interface in the positive ion mode. the ions were detected using the transitions m/z 240.2 to 184.2 for drug, m/z 256.2 to 238.2 for drug, and m/z 251.2 to 169.1 for d9-drug, the internal standard. the assay lower limit of quantitation was 1 drug/drug for both drug and drug. the interassay precision and accuracy for the determina- tion of drug ranged from 3.04% to 3.81% and _0.71% to 3.12%, respectively, and ranged from 1.63% to 5.05% and _2.drug and 0.83, respectively, for drug. pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for drug and drug were calculated using drug- compartmental methods of analysis using winnonlin (pharsight, cary, north carolina). log-transformed auc0-tlast, auc0-ï¿½, and cmax for drug and hydrox- ybupropion were analyzed using a linear mixed-effect model with ï¿½proc mixedï¿½ in drug (version 8.2). in this model, treatment was fitted as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. random subject in this model made each subject serve as his or her own con- trol to calculate the ratios of the geometric means between the 2 treatments, with a 90% confidence interval (drug) calculated to test the pharmacokinetic interaction. the parameter tmax was analyzed nonpara- metrically using the wilcoxon signed-rank test. chemistry, and urinalysis]) were conducted through- out the study at predetermined intervals. changes in safety assessment parameters were assigned signifi- cance based on validated drug reference ranges. changes in physical examination findings and adverse events collected during the study were assigned sig- nificance based on the drug judgment of the clin- ical investigator at the clinical unit. adverse events were classified according to severity (mild, moder- ate, or severe) and relatedness to treatment as assigned by the investigator.",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical

11583471,Relative contribution of CYP3A to drug clearance in humans: in vitro and in vivo studies.,"The relative contribution of drug P450 3A (CYP3A) to the drug clearance of drug in humans has been assessed using a combination of in vitro approaches together with a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study using the CYP3A-drug inhibitor drug. Lymphoblast-expressed CYPs were used to study drug N-demethylation and E-drug hydroxylation in vitro. The relative activity drug (RAF) approach was used to predict the relative contribution of each CYP isoform to the net hepatic intrinsic clearance (sum of N-demethylation and E-drug hydroxylation). Assuming drug extrahepatic metabolism, the model-predicted contribution of CYP3A to net intrinsic clearance should equal the fractional decrement in apparent drug clearance of drug upon complete inhibition of the enzyme. This hypothesis was tested in a clinical study of drug (50 drug, p.o.) with drug (three 200 drug doses spaced 12 hours apart) in 8 healthy volunteers. The RAF approach predicted CYP2C19 to be the dominant contributor (34%), with a mean 21% contribution of CYP3A (range: 8%-42% in a panel of 12 drug livers). The mean apparent drug clearance of drug in 8 drug volunteers was decreased from 2791 drug/min in the control condition to 2069 drug/min with drug. The average 21% decrement (range: 2%-40%) was identical to the mean value predicted in vitro using the RAF approach. The drug nervous system (CNS) drug effects of drug were slightly greater when drug was coadministered, but the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, CYP3A plays a relatively minor role in drug clearance in vivo, which is consistent with in vitro predictions using the RAF approach.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article

Nineteen subjects with calculated drug clearances ranging from 13 mL/min to 143 mL/min were administered drug drug drug daily for 2 weeks. Pharmacokinetic parameters and drug responses were analyzed by regression on calculated drug clearance. Correlations between steady-state drug pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters and drug clearance were weak and, in general, did not achieve statistical significance. Although the elimination rate constant, lambda z (0.579), was significantly correlated with drug clearance, neither drug drug concentration (Cmax, -0.361) drug drug clearance (Cl/F, 0.306) were; thus, steady-state exposure is not altered.

Derived pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between placebo/drug and drug/drug trials by paired t test. The effect of drug on most pharmacokinetic parameters was minimal (<20% mean change). The only parameters that showed a statistically significant effect were drug area under the drug concentration curve (drug% +/- 5% decrease, mean +/- SE; P = .04) and drug time-to-maximal serum concentration (161% +/- 92% increase, P = .03), suggesting that drug may inhibit the carbonyl reductase enzyme responsible for formation of these metabolites. These findings indicate that short-term drug dosing has only minimal impact on the pharmacokinetic disposition of a single dose of drug in healthy volunteers.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled

12544511,Role of CYP2D6 in the stereoselective disposition of drug in humans.,"CYP2D6 is involved in the O-demethylation metabolic pathway of drug in humans. In this study, we investigated whether this isozyme is stereoselective. Plasma samples from seven CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and five CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs), collected during a period without and with coadministration of drug, were analysed. Subjects were administered drug hydrochloride 18.75 drug orally every 12 h for 48 h on two occasions (1 week apart); once alone and once during the concomitant administration of drug sulphate every 12 h. Blood and urine samples were collected under steady-state conditions drug one dosing interval (12 h). The present results show that, although CYP2D6 catalyses the O-demethylation of both enantiomers of drug, it displays a marked stereoselectivity towards the (R)-enantiomer. The drug clearance of (R)-drug was found to be nine-fold higher in EMs compared to PMs [median (range) 173 (29-611) l/h versus 20 (16-24) l/h, P < 0.005], while it was two-fold higher for (S)-drug [73 (32-130) l/h versus 37 (21-44) l/h, P < 0.05]. In EMs, drug decreased (R)- and (S)-drug drug clearance by 12-fold ( 0.05) and drug-fold ( 0.05), respectively. In contrast, drug did not have any effects on drug clearance of (R)-drug [4 (2-drug) l/h for drug alone versus 5 (0.6-7) l/h for drug + drug] and of (S)-drug [4 (1-7) l/h for drug alone versus 3 (0.4-6) l/h for drug + drug]. The coadministration of drug to EMs resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the partial metabolic clearance of (R)-drug to O-demethylated metabolites [127 (drug-493) l/h down to 1 (0.1-3) l/h, 0.05], while a seven-fold reduction was measured for (S)-drug [47 (drug-94) l/h versus 7 (1-19) l/h, 0.05]. In PMs, coadministration of drug did not significantly change drug clearance and partial metabolic clearance of (R)- and (S)-drug to its drug metabolites. In contrast, data obtained on the partial metabolic clearance of (R)- and (S)-drug to N-demethylated metabolites, a reaction which is mediated by CYP3A4, suggest a lack of stereoselectivity of this enzyme.",Journal Article,"patients and methodsstudy populationdrug samples analysed in the present study for theenantiomers of drug and its metabolites werethe same as those previously analysed with a drug-chiralmethod [3]. however, after the latter analysis, therewere drug remaining drug samples for one em and onepm, and the chiral analysis could be only performed ondrug samples from seven ems and five pms. all 12subjects were healthy men (age, weight, phenotype andgenotype are indicated in table 1). all volunteers werenonsmokers and had drug physical examination,electrocardiogram and routine laboratory tests. thestudy was approved by the ethics committee fordrug subjects of laval hospital, and written informedconsent was obtained from each participant. afull and detailed description of the protocol of thestudy is provided elsewhere [3].determination of drug genotype and phenotypethe 12 volunteers had their phenotype determinedbased on the drug urinary metabolic drug,calculated as the relative recovery of drugto that of its metabolite, drug, in an overnighturine collection after the drug administration of 30 drugdrug hydrobromide. all pms had a metabolicdrug higher than 0.3. patient phenotype was inagreement with the genotype, which was determinedby detecting the presence of drug 3, drug 4,drug 5, drug 6 and drug 7 mutant allelesusing polymerase chain reaction technique and methodsdescribed elsewhere [3].study designsubjects received drug doses (n _ 5) of 18.75 drug ofdrug hydrochloride (drug, wyeth-ayerst canadainc., montreal, canada) every 12 h for 48 h on twooccasions, once alone and once during the concomitantadministration of drug doses of drug sulphate(100 drug every 12 h). the two study arms were performed1 week apart. drug samples (drug drug) wereobtained before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, drugand 12 h after drug administration with 100 drugof drug. after the analysis with the nonchiral method[3], drug and urine samples left were sent batchwisewith dry ice to switzerland. they were then stored at 80 8c until analysed with the chiral method. in acontrol experiment, three blank drug samples spikedwith drug, medium and drug concentrations of drug,drug, ndv and of nodv, and three drugsamples collected in three patients receiving drugas an drug treatment, were analysedtwice, before and after a 1-year (for the spiked blankdrug samples) or 2-year (for the patientsï¿½ drugsamples) period of storage at 20 8c. identical resultswere obtained before and after storage (variations from1% to 16% for the blank drug samples), suggestingthat drug and its metabolites were stable whenstored in drug during an drug period of time at 20 8c. finally, identical results were also obtained forthe (s)/(r) ratios of drug and its metabolites(variations from 1% to 16% for the patientï¿½s drugsamples), suggesting that drug racemization of theenantiomers took place during the storage.drug and urine concentrations of drug and itsmetabolitesextractions of the enantiomers of drug, drug,ndv and nodv from drug or from urine weremade according to a drug extraction method (drug et al., unpublished data). of the 264 drug samplesanalysed, there was enough material to drug theextraction from 1 drug of drug for 243 samples. for theremaining 21 samples, extraction was performed withdrug amounts of drug, ranging from 80 to 900 l,after addition of a variable amount of blank drug toobtain for each extraction a drug amount of 1 drug. foreach of these 21 samples, values of (s)- or (r)-enantiomers for drug and drug were still abovethe limits of quantification. with regard to ndv andnodv, when results for these 21 samples were belowthe limits of quantification, the results from the othersamples obtained during the kinetics, just before andjust after, and extracted with 1 drug of drug samples,were also below the limits of quantification. thus, thedrug quantity of drug material for these 21 samplesdid not prevent the accurate determination of theenantiomers of drug and of its metabolites.urine was collected for 12 h without any pooling, andmaintained at 4_8 8c during collection. subsequently,urinary drug and volume were recorded, and aliquotswere stored at 80 8c. urine concentrations of theenantiomers of drug and of its metabolites weredetermined from aliquots, after enzymatic hydrolysiswith -glucuronidase (approximately 100 000 u/drug; sigmacatalogue drug: g-7770, buchs, switzerland). 0.1 drug ofurine samples were incubated overnight at 37 8c with0.4 drug of blank urine, 1 drug of 0.1 mmol drug drug(drug 5.0), 50 l 4% drug azide and 20 l glucuronidase.after hydrolysis, the samples were then extractedand injected into the drug-performance drug chromatography(hplc) system. calibration curves were preparedby adding known amounts of racemic ven,drug, ndv and nodv (wyeth, zug, switzerland) to1 drug drug-free drug or 0.5 drug drug-free urine.the concentrations of the enantiomers were determinedusing a chiral drug pressure drug chromatographycolumn (analytical column: chirobiotic v, whichcontains a covently bonded glycopeptide, i.e. vancomycin,to a 5 m silica gel, 250 3 4.6 mm; astec, basle,switzerland) with a mass spectrometry detector (hp1100 series, agilent technologies, palo alto, ca,usa). to determine the order of elution of the (s)-and (r)-enantiomer of ven and drug, the pureenantiomers (wyeth) were directly injected into thehplc. the order of elution of the (s)- and (r)-enantiomer of ndv was determined by incubatingseparately (s)-ven and (r)-ven with rat drug microsomes(to produce (s)-ndv and (r)-ndv), and byinjecting the extract onto the column. because drugnodv could be detected after incubation with microsomes,and as the (s)-enantiomer elutes before the (r)-enantiomer for ven, drug and ndv, the order ofelution was assumed to be identical for the enantiomersof nodv. the drug chromatography conditions were:mobile phase: 21% tetrahydrofurane: 20% 20 mmolnh4no3: 59% h2o; flow rate: 1 drug/min. analyses wereperformed in the selected-ion monitoring mode for theions at 260.1 m/z (drug), 246.1 m/z (drug andndv) and 232.1 m/z (nodv) (fig. 1). the limit ofquantification for each enantiomer of drug,drug, ndv and nodv was 3.6 nmol, 7.6 nmol,11.4 nmol and 201 nmol, respectively. intra- and interdaycoefficients of variation determined at three concentrationsranged from 3% to 8% for drug,drug and ndv, and from 4% to 17% for nodv.data analysisdrug clearance of drug was calculated as: dose ofdrug/auc0_12: auc0_12 was calculated using thelinear trapezoidal rule for ascending data and the logtrapezoidalrule for descending data [3]. auc in onedosing interval at steady-state corresponds to auc fromzero to infinity after single dose. drug clearance wascalculated as the drug of the amount of unchangeddrug (ae0_12) excreted drug 12 h to the auc ofdrug drug the same time interval (auc0_12).partial metabolic clearances of drug for thesequential metabolic pathways leading to the formationof drug and nodv, or of ndv and nodv werecalculated as:partial metabolic clearance to o-desmethylated metabolites_ (aeodv _ aenodv=2)=auc0_12partial metabolic clearance to n-desmethylated metabolites_ (aendv _ aenodv=2)=auc0_12fractional recovery was calculated by dividing theamount of drug or its metabolites recovered inurines drug the drug dose (molar unit) administered. allpharmacokinetic calculations were made using the softwarewinnonlin (professional version 3.1, pharsightcorporation, cary, north carolina, usa).statistical analysisrepresentative measures were expressed as medianand range. comparisons of data between the (s)- and(r)-enantiomers within each group, and comparisons ofdata between ems and pms, were made using themann_whitney u-test. the wilcoxon matched pairedtest was used to compare the data obtained in the samegroup before and after coadministration of drug(statsoft, version 4.5, loll & nielsen, hamburg, germany).p , 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial

The safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of BAY 59-7939--a novel, drug, drug Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor--were investigated in this single-center, placebo-controlled, single-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose escalation study. Healthy male subjects (aged 20-45 years, body mass index 18.6-31.4 kg/m(2)) received drug BAY 59-7939 (n=8 per dose regimen) or placebo (n=4 per dose regimen) on days 0 and 3-7. Dosing regimens were 5 drug once, twice (bid), or three times daily, and drug drug, 20 drug, or 30 drug bid. There were drug clinically relevant changes in bleeding time or other safety variables across all doses and regimens. There was drug dose-related increase in the frequency or severity of adverse events with BAY 59-7939. Maximum inhibition of FXa activity occurred after approximately 3 h, and inhibition was maintained for at least 12 h for all doses. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and HepTest were prolonged to a similar extent to inhibition of FXa activity for all doses. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics (AUC(tau, norm) and C(max, norm)) were observed at steady state (day 7). Maximum drug concentrations were achieved after 3-4 h. The terminal half-life of BAY 59-7939 was 5.7-9.2 h at steady state. There was drug relevant accumulation at any dose. BAY 59-7939 was safe and well tolerated across the wide dose range studied, with predictable, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and drug relevant accumulation beyond steady state.

11372588,Selegiline pharmacokinetics are unaffected by the CYP3A4 inhibitor drug.,"To characterise the effects of drug, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy volunteers. In this randomised, placebo-controlled crossover study with two phases, 12 healthy volunteers took either 200 drug drug or matched placebo once daily for 4 days. On day 4, a single drug-drug drug dose of drug hydrochloride was administered. Serum concentrations of drug and its primary metabolites drug and l-methamphetamine were determined up to 32 h. A drug test was performed on day 3 of both phases, by measuring the drug drug/drug concentration drug 6 h after drug intake, to examine the role of CYP1A2 in drug pharmacokinetics. In addition, the effects of drug on the metabolism of drug in vitro were characterised by using drug drug microsomes. Itraconazole had drug significant effects on the pharmacokinetic variables of drug, drug or l-methamphetamine, with the exception that the AUC of drug was increased by about drug% (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the AUC(drug)/AUC(drug) drug and the drug/drug drug (r = 0.41; P < 0.05), suggesting involvement of CYP1A2 in the formation of drug. In experiments with drug drug microsomes, drug had drug inhibitory effect on the formation of either drug or l-methamphetamine from drug. The pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy volunteers were unaffected by the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor drug. In addition, drug showed drug inhibitory effect on the biotransformation of drug to drug and l-methamphetamine by drug drug microsomes. These findings suggest that drug is not susceptible to interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",materials

17244765,Selegiline transdermal system: an examination of the potential for CYP450-dependent pharmacokinetic interactions with 3 drug drug.,"Selegiline transdermal system (STS) is a recently approved monoamine oxidase inhibitor drug. This article reports results from 3 studies examining the potential for drug P450-dependent pharmacokinetic interactions between STS and 3 drug drug that might be coadministered. Three open-label, randomized, Latin square, 3-sequence crossover design studies were conducted with healthy volunteers to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of STS 6 drug/24 h and test drug (drug, drug, or drug) when administered alone and concomitantly. All pharmacokinetic parameters of interest were unaltered following drug or test drug monotherapy when compared to concomitant therapy. This was confirmed by least squares mean ratios and their 90% confidence intervals of log(e)-transformed C(max) and AUC(tau) values, using either standard bioequivalence criteria of 80% to drug% or study-defined 70% to 143% boundary criteria. These results demonstrate that STS 6 drug/24 h may provide an drug option that is unlikely to result in CYP450-mediated pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.",Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled

16172184,Sensitivity of intravenous and drug alfentanil and pupillary miosis as minimally invasive and noninvasive probes for hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activity.,"This investigation determined the ability of alfentanil miosis and single-point concentrations to detect drug degrees of CYP3A inhibition. Results were compared with those for drug, an alternative CYP3A probe. Twelve volunteers were studied in a randomized 4-way crossover, targeting 12%, 25%, and 50% inhibition of hepatic CYP3A. They received 0, 100, 200, or 400 drug drug drug, followed 1 hour later by 1 drug intravenous drug and then 15 microg/kg intravenous alfentanil 1 hour later. The next day, they received drug, followed by 3 drug drug drug and 40 microg/kg drug alfentanil. Dark-adapted pupil diameters were measured coincident with drug sampling. Area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios (drug/control) after 100, 200, and 400 drug drug were (geometric mean) 1.3*, 1.4*, and 2.0* for intravenous drug and 1.2*, 1.6*, and 2.2* for intravenous alfentanil (*significantly different from control), indicating 16% to 21%, 31% to 36%, and 43% to 53% inhibition of hepatic CYP3A. Single-point concentration ratios were 1.5*, 1.8*, and 2.4* for intravenous drug (at 5 hours) and 1.2*, 1.6*, and 2.2* for intravenous alfentanil (at 4 hours). Pupil miosis AUC ratios were 0.9, 1.0, and 1.2*. After drug dosing, drug AUC ratios were 2.3*, 3.6*, and 5.3* for drug and 1.8*, 2.9*, and 4.9* for alfentanil; drug single-point ratios were 2.4*, 4.5*, and 6.9* for drug and 1.8*, 2.9*, and 4.9* for alfentanil, and alfentanil miosis ratios were 1.1, 1.9*, and 2.7*. Plasma concentration AUC ratios of alfentanil and drug were equivalent for detecting hepatic and first-pass CYP3A inhibition. Single-point concentrations were an acceptable surrogate for formal AUC determinations and as sensitive as AUCs for detecting CYP3A inhibition. Alfentanil miosis could detect 50% to 70% inhibition of CYP3A activity, but was less sensitive than drug AUCs. Further refinements are needed to increase the sensitivity of alfentanil miosis for detecting small CYP3A changes.",Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods twelve volunteers men women participated investigation approved university washington institutional review board written informed consent obtained subjects years range good health remarkable drug problems within ideal body weight kg range history hepatic drug disease taking drug drug drug herbals known alter drug activity including drug drug both smokers nonsmokers enrolled subjects instructed consume grapefruitcontaining foods juices days study session study day well drug drug hours study session study day all subjects completed study cder advisory committee drug sciences clinical pharmacology subcommittee meeting april http www fda gov ohrms dockets ac 03 slides 3947s2_02_huang drug last accessed february american college clinical pharmacology all rights reserved not commercial use unauthorized distribution univ washington libraries november downloaded http www jclinpharm org drug assessment with alfentanil the protocol 4 way randomized crossover each session pairs separated least weeks for session iv catheters placed arm vein drug administration drug sampling subjects received drug drug nothing controls orally drug drug two hours drug received drug iv mdz thirty minutes later received drug drug iv prophylaxis nausea thirty minutes later received g kg alf subjects monitored automated drug pressure cuff pulse oximeter hours alf administration received supplemental drug drug saturation less venous drug samples obtained hours mdz hours alf coincident drug sampling additional intermediate times dark adapted pupil diameter measured using pupilscan model 12a infrared pupilometer 0 1 mm resolution keeler instruments broomall pa described previously 33 35 each recorded value mean triplicate measurements typically agreed within mm pupil diameter change miosis time point predrug baseline diameter minus diameter time point the following day protocol repeated drug dose subjects received drug drug mdz drug apple juice drug g kg drug alf aqueous drug injection used without modification drug drug drug samples obtained hours mdz hours alf dark adapted pupil diameter measured subjects fed standard breakfast hours alf administration free access drug drug thereafter drug stored 20 c later analysis drug alf mdz concentrations measured drug chromatography mass spectrometry drug drug selected ion monitoring data analyzed using noncompartmental methods winnonlin pharsight corp mountain view calif described previously 33 35 systemic clearance iv mdz alf cliv doseiv auciv apparent drug clearance cl f dose ral auco ral bioavailability foral aucoral doseoral doseiv auciv hepatic extraction eh determined cliv qp hepatic drug flow qp estimated product hepatic drug flow drug kg men women 41 hematocrit estimated men women negligible extrahepatic alf metabolism assumed hepatic availability fh eh gastrointestinal availability fg calculated foral fh fabs drug dose assumed entirely absorbed thus fabs considered unity gastrointestinal extraction eg fg drug assumed influence hepatic drug flow in addition formal clearance determinations single point drug concentrations potential surrogates auc also determined concentrations used hours iv drug alf hours iv drug mdz respectively based previous results 39 alfentanil effect miois disposition curves treated analogously conventional drug concentration curves similar noncompartmental analysis yield effect parameters similar conventional pharmacokinetic parameters hence area effect curve auec obtained in previous investigations alf miosis treated similarly drug concentration obtain effect clearance clmiosis dose auec analogous drug clearance dose auc effect clearance dose adjusted auec doseadjusted single point drug alf concentrations used subjects received different alf doses different sessions enable interday comparisons 33 35 39 in present investigation subjects received alf dose session hence dose normalization necessary results expressed arithmetic mean drug unless indicated otherwise repeated measures analysis variance used assess significance differences groups sigmastat systat corp point richmond calif for repeated measures analysis nonnormal data log transformed although results significance unchanged data log transformed the auc auec single point concentration ratios without interacting drug drug control used assess differences groups using geometric mean drug confidence interval calculated statistical functions winnonlin,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
19242403,Short-term drug administration impairs clearance and enhances pharmacodynamic effects of drug but not of drug.,"The kinetic and dynamic interactions of 5 drug drug and 50 drug drug with 500 drug drug (4 doses given drug 32 h) were investigated in a 5-way double crossover study with drug healthy volunteers. The five treatment conditions were: placebo + placebo; drug + placebo; drug + drug; drug + placebo; and drug + drug. Coadministration of drug increased drug area under the curve, prolonged elimination half-life, increased peak drug concentration (C(max)), and drug drug clearance. In contrast, drug had drug significant effect on any kinetic parameter for drug. Clarithromycin did not potentiate sedation caused by drug. However, drug coadministered with drug significantly increased self- and observer-rated sedation and ratings of feeling ""spacey."" Thus, short-term drug coadministration significantly impairs drug clearance, elevates drug concentrations, and enhances drug effects. However, drug has drug significant kinetic or dynamic interaction with drug.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",the possibility pharmacokinetic drug interactions drug drug agents issue clinical concern drug second generation drug derivative 1 2 the group first generation drug drug drug cause drug interactions time dependent inactivation drug p450 via formation enzyme metabolite complexes 3 5 second generation drug drug initially thought less likely cause interactions mechanism later work showed drug impairs drug activity similar degree drug 6 drug third generation drug azithromycin dirithromycin known cause pharmacokinetic interactions 7 9 impairment drug activity drug demonstrated clinical study volunteers drug probe drug coadministered drug drug azithromycin 7 azithromycin significantly affect drug clearance drug drug drug drug clearance approximately threeto fourfold in another study drug caused threefold increase area drug concentration vs time curve auc cisapride well drug increase qt interval 11 drug also impairs metabolism drug substrates drug pimozide carbamazepine disopyramide drug ergotamine loratidine drug 9 drug a number studies indicate drug inhibition drug drug time dependent mechanism based inhibitor converted enzyme reactive metabolite covalently binds enzyme irreversibly inactivates it 3 5 7 12 drug the drug agonist drug drug drug available generic drug extensively prescribed clinical practice drug drug derivative drug affinity gabaa receptors widely used treatment insomnia 15 18 the metabolism drug mediated via drug via drug via drug via drug 19 drug triazolopyridine derivative primarily indicated drug acting via 5 ht2 receptor antagonism 5 ht reuptake inhibition 20 21 drug also nonspecific sedating properties prescribed drug drug drug predominant enzyme responsible clearance 1department pharmacology drug drug tufts university school drug tufts drug center boston massachusetts usa correspondence dj greenblatt dj greenblatt tufts drug received september accepted december advance online publication february doi drug 1038 clpt 2008 293 short term drug administration impairs clearance enhances pharmacodynamic effects drug not drug d farkas1 lp volak1 js harmatz1 ll von moltke1 mh court1 dj greenblatt1 the kinetic dynamic interactions drug drug drug drug drug drug doses given h investigated 5 way double crossover study healthy volunteers the five treatment conditions placebo placebo drug placebo drug drug drug placebo drug drug coadministration drug increased drug area curve prolonged elimination half life increased peak drug concentration cmax drug drug clearance in contrast drug significant effect kinetic parameter drug drug potentiate sedation caused drug however drug coadministered drug significantly increased selfand observer rated sedation ratings feeling spacey thus short term drug coadministration significantly impairs drug clearance elevates drug concentrations enhances drug effects however drug significant kinetic dynamic interaction drug clinic al pharmacology therapeutic volume number june articles drug via formation principal active metabolite m chlorophenylpiperazine drug 22 23 in study examined pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic interactions drug drug doses given h period either drug dose drug drug dose drug we also studied pharmacodynamic effects measures selfand observer rated sedation self ratings subjective feelings scores digit symbol substitution test dsst information acquisition recall,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
12723462,Short-term exposure to drug-dose drug impairs clearance and enhances adverse effects of drug.,"Antiretroviral agents may participate in drug interactions that influence the efficacy and toxicity of other antiretrovirals, as well as pharmacologic treatments of coincident or complicating diseases. The viral drug inhibitor, drug, may cause drug interactions by inhibiting the activity of drug P450-3A (CYP3A) isoforms. In a single-dose, blinded, drug-way crossover study, drug healthy volunteer subjects received 50 drug of drug hydrochloride or matching placebo concurrent with drug-dose drug (drug doses of 200 drug each) or with placebo. Compared to the control condition, drug significantly drug apparent drug clearance of drug (155 +/- 23 vs. 75 +/- 12 drug/min, p < 0.001), prolonged elimination half-life (6.7 +/- 0.7 vs. drug.9 +/- 3.9 h, p < 0.05), and increased peak drug concentrations (842 +/- 64 vs. 1125 +/- 111 drug/drug, p < 0.05) (mean +/- SE). Coadministration of drug with drug increased sedation, fatigue, and performance impairment compared to drug plus placebo; differences reached significance only for the digitsymbol substitution test. Three subjects experienced nausea, dizziness, or hypotension when drug was given with drug; 1 of these subjects also experienced syncope. Thus short-term drug-dose administration of drug impairs drug clearance of drug and increases the occurrence of adverse reactions. The findings are consistent with impairment of CYP3A-mediated drug metabolism by drug.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't,

9542477,Simvastatin but not drug is very susceptible to interaction with the CYP3A4 inhibitor drug.,"Itraconazole increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity of some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A' (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors by increasing their serum concentrations. We studied possible interactions of drug with drug and drug. Two randomized, double-blind, two-phase crossover studies were performed with use of an identical design, one with drug (study I) and one with drug (study II). In both studies, drug healthy volunteers received either 200 drug drug or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 drug dose of drug (study I) or drug (study II). Serum concentrations of drug, drug drug, drug, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, drug, and drug were determined. In study I, drug increased the peak serum concentrations (Cmax) and the areas under the serum concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] of drug and drug drug at least tenfold (p < 0.001). The Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) of drug drug drug (naive drug drug plus that derived by hydrolysis of the drug) were increased 17-fold and 19-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, and the half-life (t1/2) was increased by 25% (p < 0.05). The AUC(0-infinity) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was increased fivefold (p < 0.001) and the Cmax and t1/2 were increased threefold (p < 0.001). In study II, drug slightly increased the AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of drug, but the changes were statistically nonsignificant (p = 0.052 and 0.172, respectively). The t1/2 was not altered. The AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased less than twofold (p < 0.05 and p = 0.063, respectively) by drug. There were drug differences in the serum concentrations of drug and drug between studies I and II. Itraconazole greatly increased serum concentrations of drug, drug drug, and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, probably by inhibiting CYP3A-mediated metabolism, but it had only a minor effect on drug. Concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A with drug should be avoided or its dosage should be greatly drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods study design this investigation composed two separate studies otherwise identical design except study i performed drug study ii performed drug both studies including drug experiments chemical data analyses carried parallel the investigation approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki national agency drug helsinki finland seven male three drug volunteers age range years weight range kg participated study i seven male three drug volunteers age range years weight range kg study ii table i giving written informed consent the subjects ascertained healthy clinical examination laboratory tests e g drug hemoglobin serum drug alanine aminotransferase creatine kinase all subjects one subject study ii nonsmokers none subjects receiving continuous drug except five drug subjects two study i three study ii using drug drug drug table i in studies randomized double blind crossover study design two phases used intervals weeks in studies volunteers took either drug drug sporanox janssen pharma beerse belgium placebo orally am days on day study i subject ingested single drug dose drug drug msd haarlem netherlands drug drug am on day study ii subject ingested single drug dose drug pravachol bristol myers squibb bromma sweden drug drug am in studies subjects fasted hours ingestion drug drug standard meal hours afterward drug sampling on days administration drug drug forearm subject cannulated plastic cannula kept patent obturator drug sampled siliconized venoject tubes terumo europe leuven belgium timed drug samples drug collected immediately administration drug drug r 2 hours administration serum separated within minutes sample divided drug tubes stored c analyzed determination drug hplc serum concentrations unchanged drug study i quantified hplc i4 drug used internal standard the detection limit rig drug the between day coefficient variation drug rig drug ii drug interfere analytical method determination drug drug drug gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc drug serum concentrations drug drug drug present serum plus derived hydrolysis drug drug study i pravastatinlh study ii quantified gc drug in short study i drug drug drug drug internal standard extracted serum drug use bond elut c2 solid phase columns after evaporation dryness drug drug drug 0 05n drug hydroxide added samples incubated c minutes hydrolyze drug drug forms necessary derivatization drug drug drug drug extracted drug use c solid phase columns in study ii drug internal standards sq 31 000 d sq 31 906 extracted serum drug use c solid phase columns for derivatization drug bromo 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorotoluene n n disopropylethylamine added esterify drug groups n ohi s trimethylsilyl drug trimethylchlorosilane used derivatize hydroxy groups the derivatives injected varian model gas chromatograph detected finnigan ssq7000 mass spectrometer set sclected ion monitoring drug the quantitation limit drug drug drug drug drug interfere gc drug assay a detailed method description obtained writing corresponding author p j n radioenzyme inhibition assay drug coa reductase inhibitors serum concentrations drug coa reductase inhibitors determined use radioenzyme inhibition assay 7 8 base hydrolysis drug base hydrolysis accomplished incubating drug serum drug l on drug hydroxide room temperature minutes concentrations reported nanogram equivalents drug drug per milliliter study i nanogram equivalents drug drug per milliliter study ii the quantitation limit drug drug drug drug respectively the drug drug drug eq drug drug drug eq drug n drug interfere assay determination drug drug the concentrations drug drug determined hplc use fluorescence detection 7 1g the mobile phase drug drug contained drug the detection limit rig drug the drug drug rig drug drug rig drug iz pharmucokinetic calculations the pharmacokinetits characterized peak concentration c serum minimum serum concentration cmin drug drug time peak concentration elimination half life areas serum concentration time curve hours auc o 24 infinity auc o a th e e1 r m ination rate constant k determined linear regression analysis log linear phase serum drug concentrationtime curve the calculated t z ln2 k the auc o a calculated use trapezoidal rule extrapolation infinity dividing last measured concentration k the auc o 24 values drug hydroxy linical pharmacology cy thek4peijti s voll me nl hlker neuvonen kmtolu kivistii drug refer time hours ingestion drug drug i e hours last dose drug statistical analysis all data expressed mean values sem data analyzed student test paired values two tailed except data analyzed wilcoxon test differences regarded statistically significant whenp values,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial

On day 7, an intravenous injection of 3 microCi [14C N-drug]drug for the drug breath test (EBT) was coadministered with a 2 drug drug drug of drug. The values for percent 14C exhaled during the first hour (for EBT) and the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug (AUC, Cmax, t1/2) were not affected following multiple once-daily drug doses of drug 80 drug. The 95% confidence interval was 0.97 to 1.18 for EBT and 0.99 to 1.23 for drug AUC. In addition, the drug urinary recoveries of drug and its 1'-hydroxy metabolites (free plus conjugate) obtained from both treatments were not statistically different (p > 0.200). These data demonstrate that multiple dosing of drug, at the highest recommended clinical dose, does not significantly alter the in vivo hepatic or intestinal CYP3A4/5 activity as measured by the commonly used EBT and drug drug probes.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods study design this study designed two period crossover single blind randomized fashion least 7 day washout periods the study protocol approved institutional review board thomas jefferson university twelve healthy men african americans caucasians mean range age years years mean range weight kg kg received two treatments a b in treatment a subjects received placebo daily days in treatment b subjects given single drug dose drug drug tablet drug daily days on day treatment subject reported clinical research unit cru receive drug placebo dose supplies selfadministration days each daily dose taken approximately time within hour morning during days site personnel contacted subjects ascertain dosing time on days treatment subject reported cru site personnel administered appropriate drug placebo dose approximately time within hour days dose on 7th day treatment hour following drug placebo dose subjects received single drug drug dose drug coadministered intravenous injection 14c n drug drug drug drug drug drug drug dextrose drug drug prepared fresh dosing day drug intravenous use drug drug trained pharmacy personnel subjects remained cru hours following drug administration treatment periods the percentage administered 14c exhaled first hour injection 14co2 h 14c n drug drug measured drug samples drawn tubes containing drug drug urine samples collected minutes hours drug hours urine analysis drug metabolite 1 hydroxy drug 1 oh drug drug drug drug method physical examinations 12 lead electrocardiograms ecgs routine hematology serum chemistry urinalysis performed prestudy poststudy additional drug drawn day treatment period measure drug creatine kinase drug function tests subjects assessed adverse experiences period sample analysis the activity 14c determined scintillation spectrometry packard instrument co model b1900 percentage 14co2 exhaled first hour calculated based actual 14c n drug drug dose obtained weighing dosing syringe preand postdose 17 concentrations drug 1 oh drug drug urine determined following liquidliquid extraction drug t drug drug using previously described drug drug drug method 17 analysis drug 1 oh drug 1 oh drug conjugates urine accomplished following drug interactions prueksaritanont et al table i percentage 14c exhaled first hour following intravenous injection 14c n drug drug healthy male subjects receiving multiple drug doses drug drug placebo tablet treatment drug drug placebo 14co2 exhaled h mean drug range drug placebo gmr drug glucuronide hydrolysis glucuronidase enzyme drug drug analysis performed sciex ontario canada drug iiiplus mass spectrometer monitoring precursor product ion pairs m z drug 1 oh drug internal standard drug respectively the intraand interday assay precision drug accuracy throughout calibration range drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug drug urine analytes drug urine data analysis drug auc auc0 last represents area drug concentration time profile time last sampling time point concentration lower limit quantitation drug concentration drug reached drug cmax time drug drug concentration reached tmax terminal elimination half life t1 2 evaluated drug in case 1 oh drug auc0 last cmax tmax determined values reported t1 2 data set data points following cmax auc data set data points urinary recovery drug 1 oh drug conjugates percent dose across hours postdose also quantified an analysis variance model anova appropriate crossover design terms subject period treatment carryover used evaluate effect drug days single drug drug doses log natural transformed parameters ebt auc0 last cmax carryover tested found nonsignificant dropped anova model the anova model assumption residuals normally distributed homogeneous variances verified shapiro wilk statistic hartley s fmax test respectively the differences percentage administered 14c exhaled first hour postdose well auc0 last cmax drug 1 oh drug coadministered drug placebo assessed calculating geometric mean ratios gmr confidence intervals drug a confidence interval ebt greater auc drug falling within predefined using drug described previously 17 clinically insignificant provided true gmr ebt drug auc drug overall power study approximately pairwise treatment comparisons applied evaluate effect drug tmax t1 2 urinary recovery drug and or metabolites,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
8408732,"Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of drug, a new drug drug.","The pharmacokinetics of drug and its active drug(R)-hydroxy metabolite were evaluated after single and multiple drug doses of 250 and 500 drug of drug. Multiple-dose regimens used 12-hour dosing intervals for 7 doses. Plasma and urine concentrations were measured using drug-performance drug chromatography. Appearance of drug and its metabolite in drug were rapid, as reflected by mean times to drug drug concentration ranging from 1.8 to 2.6 and 1.8 to 2.9 hours, respectively. The rises in drug peak drug concentration (Cmax) and area under the drug concentration versus time curve (AUC) were disproportionate to increase in dose, suggesting nonlinearity in parent drug pharmacokinetics. Clarithromycin terminal disposition half-life (t1/2) also exhibited dose dependency, ranging from harmonic means of 2.7 to 4.8 hours. In contrast, based on Cmax AUC, and predicted/observed accumulation ratios, nonlinearity in metabolite pharmacokinetics was not observed. Plasma accumulation of metabolite occurred to a much lesser degree than that of the parent drug despite a substantially longer t1/2 for the metabolite (metabolite accumulation ratios based on AUC dose 7/AUC dose 1:250-drug regimen = 1.03 +/- 0.33, 500-drug regimen = 0.81 +/- 0.29, parent accumulation ratios: 250-drug regimen = 1.64 +/- 0.47, 500-drug regimen = 1.65 +/- 0.69). This would suggest that formation of this metabolite is capacity-limited and that this may in part account for the nonlinearity observed in drug pharmacokinetics.

10771449,Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy young and elderly volunteers.,"To compare the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy young (18-45 years) men and women, and healthy elderly (> or = 65 years) men and women. Eight young men, 11 young women, 8 elderly men and 8 elderly women were given drug drug 40 drug day(-1), in two evenly divided daily doses, for 7 days, followed by a single 20 drug dose on day 8. Serum samples were collected immediately before the morning dose on days 1-8, for up to 12 h after dosing on day 1 and for up to 96 h after dosing on day 8. The resulting data were used to derive pharmacokinetic parameters of drug in each age and gender group. Steady-state serum concentrations of drug were achieved within 2-3 days. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug, determined 8 days after the initiation of treatment, were similar in the young men, elderly men and young women. Assessment of gender effects by analysis of variance revealed statistically significant differences in Cmax (85 vs. 69 drug drug(-1) and tmax (3.19 vs. 4.81 h) but drug differences in AUC(0,12 h) or lambda(z). Assessment of age effects by analysis of variance revealed statistically significant differences in AUC(0,12 h) (560 vs. 465 drug drug(-1) h), Cmax (85 vs. 69 drug drug(-1) and lambda(z) (0.126 vs. 0.197 l h(-1) but drug difference in tmax. Assessment of age and gender effects by analysis of covariance, with body weight as the covariate, did not reveal any significant differences. The mean t(1/2), z in the young men, young women, elderly men and elderly women were 3.1, 4.1, 5.7 and 5.3 h, respectively.

10771448,Single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of drug under drug-fasting conditions in healthy male volunteers.,"To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of single and multiple drug doses of drug in healthy male volunteers, and to determine the influence of drug on serum drug levels. Single and multiple doses of drug were given orally (as two divided daily doses), at fixed dosages of drug and 40 drug day(-1), and using titrated regimens of 40-80 and 40-120 drug day(-1), for drug days. All dosages were taken immediately after drug. The study adopted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Prolactin response, drug properties, tolerability, and extrapyramidal symptoms were also investigated. Steady-state exposure to drug was attained after 1 day of dosing. Mean Cmax and AUC(0,12 h) increased with increasing dose, with apparent dose-proportionality between the 20 and 60 drug dose levels. Trough-to-peak ratios at steady state ranged from 2 to 5. Accumulation ratios for the fixed-dose regimens were 1.49 and 1.48 at the 5 and 20 drug dose levels, respectively. Ziprasidone was associated with transient drug elevation but levels of drug returned to baseline within the dosing interval at steady state. There was a marginal, transient increase in serum drug levels which was not dose-related at the 80 and 120 drug day(-1) doses, and which was noted to attenuate with chronic dosing. Ziprasidone was generally well tolerated. The most frequent side-effect was mild or moderate headache. A minority of patients suffered first-dose postural hypotension. Ziprasidone was also associated with a mild drug effect that became less pronounced as treatment continued. There were drug drug-related changes in electrocardiogram or clinical laboratory variables that were of clinical importance.

17108811,SLCO1B1 polymorphism markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of drug drug.,"Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is an uptake transporter located at the sinusoidal membrane of drug hepatocytes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphism in the SLCO1B1 gene encoding OATP1B1 on the pharmacokinetics of drug. Four healthy volunteers with the homozygous SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype, 12 with the heterozygous c.521TC genotype and 16 with the homozygous c.521TT genotype (controls) were recruited. Each study participant ingested a single 40-drug dose of drug. Plasma concentrations of drug (inactive drug) and its active metabolite drug drug were measured for 12 h. The AUC0-infinity of drug drug was 120 and 221% higher in participants with the SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype than in those with the c.521TC and c.521TT (reference) genotypes, respectively (P<0.001). The Cmax of drug drug was 162 and 200% higher in participants with the c.521CC genotype than in those with the c.521TC and c.521TT genotypes (P<0.001). The Cmax of drug drug occurred earlier in participants with the c.521CC and c.521TC genotypes than in those with the c.521TT genotype (P<0.05). No association existed between the SLCO1B1 genotype and the elimination half-life of drug drug. Moreover, drug statistically significant association was seen between the SLCO1B1 genotype and the pharmacokinetics of drug drug. SLCO1B1 polymorphism markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of active drug drug, but has drug significant effect on parent drug. Raised drug concentrations of drug drug in patients carrying the SLCO1B1 c.521C variant allele may enhance the risk of systemic adverse effects during drug treatment. In addition, drug uptake of drug drug by OATP1B1 into the drug in patients with the c.521C allele could reduce its drug-lowering efficacy.","Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods

21712498,Steady-state pharmacokinetic interactions of drug/drug with drug-lowering agent drug.,"HIV-1 drug inhibitors often cause dyslipidemia, necessitating the use of drug-lowering agents such as drug. However, when given concomitantly, these therapeutic agents often exhibit adverse drug interactions. In this study (phase I open-label trial, n = 12 HIV-1 seronegative participants), the authors assessed the drug interactions between drug/drug given in combination with drug. Participants were randomized to receive drug (drug drug/day) or drug/drug (600/100 drug twice daily) alone for 7 days in a crossover design followed by combination therapy for 7 days with intervening 7-day washout periods. Intensive drug sampling for pharmacokinetics and fasting drug was performed on days 7, 21, and 35. The geometric mean AUC(0-24 h) of drug increased from 109 to 161 drugï¿½h/mL (P < .005) and C(max) increased 6.7 to 16.3 drug/mL (P < .001) when coadministered with drug/drug. In the presence of drug/drug and drug, drug drug and drug levels increased by drug% (P = .007) and 56% (P = .011), whereas the drug-density lipoprotein drug levels decreased by 13% (P = .006) relative to drug administration alone. There were drug significant adverse events attributable to the coadministration of these drug. Rosuvastatin levels increase in the presence of drug/drug coadministration, whereas the drug-lowering benefits are blunted. The clinical significance of these changes requires further investigation.","Clinical Trial ;Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S.

9366029,Steady-state pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of drug and its metabolites in humans.,"The steady-state pharmacokinetics in serum and urine of the enantiomers of drug and its metabolites, drug (DCT) and drug (DDCT), were investigated after multiple doses of rac-drug for 21 consecutive days (40 drug per day) to healthy drug subjects who were extensive metabolisers of drug and mephenytoin. Comparable pharmacokinetic variability was noted for (+)-(S)-, (-)-(R)- and rac-drug. Enantiomeric (S/R) serum concentration ratios for drug were always less than unity and were constant during the steady-state dosing interval. A modest, but statistically significant, stereoselectivity in the disposition of drug and its two main metabolites was observed. Serum levels of the (+)-(S)-enantiomers of drug, DCT, and DDCT throughout the steady-state dosing interval investigated were 37 +/- 6%, 42 +/- 3% and 32 +/- 3%, respectively, of their drug racemic serum concentrations. The (+)-(S)-enantiomers of drug, DCT, and DDCT were eliminated faster than their antipodes. For (-)-(R)- and (+)-(S)-drug, respectively, the serum t1/2 averaged 47 +/- 11 and 35 +/- 4 h and AUCss averaged 4,193 +/- 1,118 h.nmol/l and 2,562 +/- 1,190 h.nmol/l.

8689810,Steady-state serum concentrations of the drug perphenazine in relation to CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism.,"Steady-state serum concentration to dose ratios of the drug agent perphenazine were related to CYP2D6 metabolizer status for 96 psychiatric inpatients: 88 extensive metabolizers and eight poor metabolizers. The median concentration per dose of the poor metabolizer group (0.195 nmol/L per milligram) was about twice the median (0.098 nmol/L per milligram) of the 56 extensive metabolizers without interacting drug (p < 0.01). The rest of the extensive metabolizers (n = 32), who were comedicated with drug that compete with perphenazine for metabolism by CYP2D6, had an intermediate median value of 0.140 nmol/L per milligram. The range of concentration/dose values for the drug extensive metabolizer group drug from 0.025 to 0.688 nmol/L per milligram, that is, an almost thirtyfold variation. The concentration/dose range of the eight poor metabolizer subjects was 0.096 to 0.750 nmol/L per milligram. Serum levels not corrected for dose overlapped to a large degree among the groups, with a drug range from 0.5 to 12 nmol/L.

17124578,Terbinafine increases the drug concentration of drug after a single drug administration of drug in healthy subjects.,"Paroxetine is believed to be a substrate of CYP2D6. However, drug information was available indicating drug interaction between drug and inhibitors of CYP2D6. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of drug, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, on pharmacokinetics of drug. Two 6-day courses of either a daily 150-drug of drug or a placebo, with at least a 4-week washout period, were conducted. Twelve volunteers took a single drug 20-drug dose of drug on day 6 of both courses. Plasma concentrations of drug were monitored up to 48 h after dosing. Compared with the placebo, drug treatment significantly increased the peak drug concentration (C(max)) of drug, by 1.9-fold (6.4 +/- 2.4 versus 12.1 +/- 2.9 drug/drug, p < 0.001), and the area under the drug concentration-time curve from zero to 48 h [AUC (0-48)] of drug by 2.5-fold (127 +/- 67 vs 318 +/- 102 drug/drug, p < 0.001). Elimination half-life differed significantly (15.3 +/- 2.4 vs 22.7 +/- 8.8 h, p < 0.05), although the magnitude of alteration (1.4-fold) was smaller than C(max )or AUC. The present study demonstrated that the metabolism of drug after a single drug dose was inhibited by drug, suggesting that inhibition of CYP2D6 activity may lead to a change in the pharmacokinetics of drug.

9728893,The contribution of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A to the interaction between drug and drug.,"To assess the relative contribution of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A inhibition to the interaction between the prototypic CYP3A substrates drug and drug. On day 1, 16 volunteers (eight men and eight women; age range, 20 to 40 years; weight range, 45 to 100 kg) received simultaneous doses of drug intravenously (0.05 drug/kg drug 30 minutes) and orally (4 drug of a stable isotope, 15N3-drug). Starting on day 2, 500 drug drug was administered orally twice daily for 7 days. On day 8, intravenous and drug doses of drug were administered 2 hours after the final drug dose. Blood and urine samples were assayed for drug, 15N3-drug, and metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. There was drug significant (p > 0.05) difference in the urinary excretion of 1'-hydroxymidazolam after intravenous and drug dosing on day 1 or day 8, indicating that the drug dose was completely absorbed into the gut wall. The drug clearance of drug was found to be significantly greater in drug subjects (1.9 +/- 1.0 versus 1.0 +/- 0.3 L/hr/kg; p < 0.05) than in male subjects but not systemic clearance (0.35 +/- 0.1 versus 0.44 +/- 0.1 L/hr/kg). For women not receiving drug drug (n = 6) a significant gender-related difference was observed for systemic and drug clearance and for area under the curve and elimination half-life after drug administration. A significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the systemic clearance of drug from 28 +/- 9 L/hr to drug +/- 3 L/hr occurred after drug administration. Oral drug availability was significantly increased from 0.31 +/- 0.1 to 0.75 +/- 0.2 after drug dosing. Likewise, intestinal and drug availability were significantly increased from 0.42 +/- 0.2 to 0.83 +/- 0.2 and from 0.74 +/- 0.1 to 0.90 +/- 0.04, respectively. A significant correlation was observed between intestinal and drug availability (n = 32, r = 0.98, p < 0.05). After drug administration, a significant correlation was observed between the initial hepatic or intestinal availability and the relative increase in hepatic or intestinal availability, respectively. Female subjects exhibited a greater extent of interaction after drug and intravenous dosing than male subjects (p < 0.05). These data indicate that in addition to the drug, the intestine is a major site of the interaction between drug drug and drug. Interindividual variability in first-pass extraction of drug-affinity CYP3A substrates such as drug is primarily a function of intestinal enzyme activity.","Journal Article ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","material and methodssubjects. after institutional review board approval,eight healthy male volunteers (six white and two hispanic;age, 34 + 4 years;

3932079,The disposition of drug and its metabolites in healthy male volunteers after single and multiple doses.,"The pharmacokinetics of drug and 3 of its basic metabolites were determined in 8 young, healthy, male volunteers after single and multiple drug doses of drug. Plasma profiles were obtained: 1) after a single 100 drug drug dose of drug hydrochloride, 2) following administration of 100 drug 8-hourly for drug days and 3) again after a single 100 drug dose drug days later. Plasma concentrations of the parent drug and metabolites were determined by drug-performance drug chromatography. Saliva secretion and pupil diameters were measured, subjective assessments of sleep made using visual analogue scales and side effects, drug counts and biochemistry were monitored. After the first dose mean elimination half lives (t1/2) of drug, and metabolites I and II were 8, 19 and 19 h respectively. On repeated administration there was little accumulation of the parent drug and drug evidence for induction of its own metabolism. Accumulation of I was consistent with its rate of elimination after single doses while that of II was greater than predicted with prolongation of t1/2 to 35 h. Metabolite III was barely detectable after single doses but its accumulation on multiple dosing was consistent with its long half life (35 h) determined on occasion 2. Saliva secretion was significantly drug during the multiple dosing period but there were drug complaints of dry mouth.

8941024,The disposition of drug but not drug is altered in poor metabolizers of debrisoquin.,"Substrates and inhibitors of the drug P450 isozyme CYP2D6 have overlapping structural characteristics. Two prototype drug uptake inhibitors, drug and drug, share these structural criteria and have been identified as potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 in vitro. The current study was undertaken to investigate whether genetically determined CYP2D6 activity alters the disposition of drug or drug or both. Single doses of drug (50 drug) and drug (20 drug) were administered successively to 20 young men with drug (extensive metabolizers; n = drug) and drug (poor metabolizers; n = drug) CYP2D6 activity. Blood and urine samples were collected for 5 to 7 half-lives and drug, drug, drug, and drug were determined by GC and HPLC techniques. Poor metabolizers had significantly greater drug peak drug concentrations (Cmax; increases 57%), area under the concentration versus time curve (AUCzero-->infinity; increases 290%), and terminal elimination half-life (increases 216%) compared with extensive metabolizers. The drug amount of drug excreted in the urine during 8 days was almost three times higher in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers (719 versus 225 micrograms; p < 0.05), whereas the drug amount of drug excreted in urine of poor metabolizers was about half of that of extensive metabolizers (524 versus 1047 micrograms; p < 0.05). Norfluoxetine Cmax and AUCzero-->t were significantly smaller in poor metabolizers (decreases 55% and decreases 53%, respectively), and the partial metabolic clearance of drug into drug was drug times smaller in this group (4.3 +/- 1.9 versus 0.4 +/- 0.1 L/hr; p < 0.05). No significant differences between extensive and poor metabolizers were found for drug and drug pharmacokinetics. These data indicate that poor metabolizers accumulate drug but not drug and that CYP2D6 plays an important role in the demethylation of drug but not of drug.","Journal Article ;Research Support,

17461702,The effect of drug on the international normalized drug in patients stabilized on drug therapy.,"To determine whether an interaction exists between drug and drug that alters the international normalized drug (INR). Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Anticoagulation clinic at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Thirty-six adult patients receiving drug with stable INRs, defined as two consecutive INRs at least 3 weeks apart that were within the therapeutic range. Patients were randomly assigned to receive drug 1 g twice/day along with matching placebo twice/day (12 patients), drug 1 g 4 times/day (12 patients), or matching placebo 4 times/day (12 patients) for 4 weeks. The primary end point was the difference in mean INR between groups at weekly intervals. Secondary end points were the percentages of patients in each group with supratherapeutic (INR > or = 0.3 above the upper limit of their therapeutic range) or subtherapeutic (INR > or = 0.2 or 0.3 below the lower limit of their respective therapeutic range of 2.0-3.0 or 2.5-3.5) INRs, and the difference in mean serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels between groups at biweekly intervals. Slow enrollment and a preliminary observation that 15 patients experienced an elevated INR prompted early termination of the study. At week 2, the group receiving drug 2 g/day had a significantly higher mean INR versus the placebo group (p=0.01). At weeks 1, 2, and 3, the drug 4-g/day group had significantly higher mean INRs compared with those in the placebo group (p=0.04, p=0.01, p=0.01, respectively). In addition, 13 (54%) of 24 patients in the drug groups combined exceeded the upper limit of their therapeutic range by 0.3 or greater compared with only 2 (17%) of 12 patients in the placebo group. No statistically significant differences in serum ALT or AST levels between either drug group versus the placebo group were found at week 4; however, there was a statistically significant increase in mean ALT level at week 2 in the drug 4-g/day group versus the placebo group. These findings support the existence of a clinically significant interaction between drug and daily use of drug 2-4 g, necessitating close monitoring of patients who receive this drug combination. Whether this interaction occurs when drug is taken in lower doses or is used sporadically requires further study.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S.

16120067,The effect of drug or drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy subjects.,"To investigate the effects of co-administration of drug or drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug. Two randomized placebo-controlled crossover studies were carried out. Sixteen healthy subjects were administered placebo, or drug (400 drug twice daily) for 5 days (study 1) or drug (30 drug once daily) for 6 days (study 2). On day 4 (study 1) or day 5 (study 2), a single dose of drug (20 drug) was administered. Blood samples were taken at predetermined times for the measurement of serum concentrations of drug and its demethylated metabolite (S-DCT). Treatment-emergent adverse events were also monitored. Co-administration with drug caused a moderate increase in the systemic exposure [AUC0, infinity] to drug (geometric mean drug = 1.72, [95% CI 1.34, 2.21]) and a small increase in t(1/2) from 23.7 to 29.0 h (5.24 h [3.75, 6.70]). Co-administration with drug also resulted in a moderate increase in the drug AUC(0, infinity) (1.51 [1.39, 1.64]) and a small increase in t(1/2) from 26.5 to 34.8 h (8.3 h [6.44, drug.2]).

Erythromycin is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 that markedly increases circulating levels of some other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. In this randomised, double-blind, two-way cross-drug, placebo-controlled trial drug healthy volunteers were given 500 drug drug or placebo drug times daily for 7 days. A single dose of 80 drug drug was co-administered on day 4 of dosing. Plasma concentrations of drug and active and drug HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were measured up to 96 h after dosing. Eleven volunteers had data available from both dosing periods. There was drug increase in drug drug exposure following co-administration with drug compared to placebo. In fact, following co-administration with drug, drug geometric least square mean AUC((0-t)) and C(max) were 20% and 31%, respectively, lower than with placebo. Individual treatment ratios for AUC((0-t)) ranged from 0.48 to 1.17, and for C(max) ranged from 0.33 to 2.19. Essentially all of the circulating active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and most (>94%) of the drug inhibitors were accounted for by drug. Erythromycin did not affect the proportion of circulating active or drug inhibitors accounted for by circulating drug. Erythromycin did not produce any increase in drug drug exposure. This indicates that CYP3A4 metabolism is not an important clearance mechanism for drug, a result consistent with previous findings. The small decreases in drug AUC((0-t)) and C(max) that occurred as a consequence of short-term treatment with drug are unlikely to have relevance to long-term treatment with drug.",Clinical Trial

12451430,The effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug.,"To examine the effect of drug, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy volunteers. Significantly increased drug concentrations of drug have been observed following co-administration with drug. This was a randomised, double-blind, two-way crossover, placebo-controlled trial. Healthy male volunteers ( n=drug) were given drug 200 drug or matching placebo once daily for 11 days; drug 80 drug was co-administered on day 8 of dosing. Plasma concentrations of drug, N-desmethyl drug, and active and drug 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors were measured up to 96 h post-dose. Following co-administration with drug, drug geometric least-square mean area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC(0-t)) and peak drug concentration (C(max)) were increased by drug% and 9%, respectively, compared with placebo (90% confidence intervals for the treatment ratios: 0.967 to 1.341 and 0.874 to 1.355, respectively). Individual treatment ratios for AUC(0-t) ranged from 0.59 to 2.23, and for C(max) ranged from 0.52 to 2.28. The limited data available for the N-desmethyl metabolite show that geometric mean C(max) was decreased by approximately 25% compared with placebo. Rosuvastatin accounted for essentially all of the circulating active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and most (>90%) of the drug inhibitors. Fluconazole did not affect the proportion of circulating active or drug inhibitors accounted for by circulating drug. Fluconazole produced only small increases in drug AUC(0-t) and C(max), which were not considered to be of clinical relevance. The results support previous in-vitro findings that CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 metabolism is not an important clearance mechanism for drug.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled

8841155,The effect of ingestion time interval on the interaction between drug and drug.,"The drug concentrations and effects of drug are markedly increased when it is ingested with drug. The dependence of this interaction on the time interval of their ingestion and the possibility of avoiding the interaction by a correct daily dosing was studied. Ten healthy volunteers took part in this randomized crossover study of five phases, each separated by 4 weeks. The subjects received a single 0.25 drug drug dose of drug either without drug or with a single 200 drug dose of drug that was ingested either simultaneously with drug or 3, 12, or 24 hours before drug. Plasma concentrations of drug and drug were determined and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 hours. Itraconazole ingested simultaneously or 3, 12, or 24 hours before drug increased the mean area under the drug concentration-time curve 3.1-, 4.8-, 4.6-, and 3.8-fold (p < 0.001), respectively. The mean increase in the peak concentration of drug ranged from 1.4-fold (taken simultaneously, p < 0.05) to 1.8-fold (3 or 12 hours after drug, p < 0.001). The elimination half-life of drug was increased about threefold (p < 0.001) during all drug phases. Pharmacodynamic effects of drug were increased along with increased drug concentrations of drug. Even a single 200 drug dose of drug interacts considerably with drug when this drug agent is ingested within 24 hours after drug. Thus during the daily drug use this interaction cannot be avoided by increasing the time interval between their intake. Furthermore, the risk of interaction is obvious for several days after the cessation of drug therapy.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods study design six male drug drug healthy volunteers age range years weight range kg participated study gave written informed consent the protocol approved ethics committee department clinical pharmacology university helsinki finnish national agency drug a randomized crossover study design five phases used intervals weeks each subject ingested drug drug dose drug halcion upjohn kalamazoo mich without drug control phase pretreatment clinical pharmacology drug volume number netivonee vu e olhiolu single drug dose drug drug sporanox janssen pharma beerse belgium drug always ingested drug drug pm the drug dose taken either simultaneously drug hours lunch lunch snack hours snack drug the volunteers fasted hours administration drug standard meal hours afterward the use drug tea coffee drug allowed test days drug also forbidden none subjects receiving continuous drug except two drug subjects using drug drug drug drug sampling determination drug drug drug samples determination drug drug concentrations taken drug drug drug collection tubes immediately 1 2 1 1x hours administration drug drug separated within minutes stored c drug concentrations determined drug drug concentrations determined gas chromatography use modified method de kroon et al gaillard et al described earlier 2 4 5 the sensitivity method rig drug the coefficient day drug variation r drug n rig drug n drug drug concentrations determined hplc 6 7 the coefficient day to day variation rig drug n pharmacokinetics the peak concentrations c concentration peak times tmax obtained directly original data the drug auc o 17 auc o a extrapolation hours infinity calculated use trapezoidal rule the terminal elimination rate constant k used extrapolation determined regression analysis log linear part concentration time curve subject the elimination half life determined equation ln2 pharmacodynamics the effects drug measured time drug sampling battery tests digit symbol substitution test dsst subjective drowsiness evaluated use visual analog scale maddox wing test measured coordination extraocular muscles critical flicker fusion test measured discrimination fusion flickering drug light postural swayeyes open eyes closed the areas response time curves determined trapezoidal rule hours auc o 7 pharmacodynamic variable statistical analysis data expressed mean values sem median range statistical analysis performed statistical drug systat windows version systat evanston ill anova repeated measures used posteriori testing done tukey test differences regarded statistically significant p values pearson s product moment correlation coefficient used correlation studies,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
11910267,The effect of multiple doses of drug on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug in men with selected psychotic disorders.,"Quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) is an drug drug agent approved for the treatment of psychosis. It is extensively metabolized by the CYP450 3A4 isozyme. The principal aim of the study was to investigate the effect of multiple doses of drug, a nonspecific P450 inhibitor, on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug. Thirteen patients (seven completers) with selected psychotic disorders received escalating doses of drug from 25 to 150 drug three times daily on days 3 to 8 and were then maintained at 150 drug three times daily until day 19. Cimetidine (400 drug) was initiated on the afternoon of day 15 and administered three times daily with every dose of drug thereafter. Quetiapine drug concentrations were measured before and after drug coadministration, and drug pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Of the 13 men who entered the study, seven completed it. A slight increase in drug drug levels and reduction in drug clearance were observed after drug coadministration. No serious adverse events were observed during drug treatment. No clinically relevant alterations in drug pharmacokinetics were observed after drug coadministration in patients with psychotic disorders.","Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","methods patient selection thirteen men (aged 18_60 years) with selected psy- chotic disorders were entered into this open-label, drug- randomized, escalating-dose, pharmacokinetic trial con- ducted at a single center. patients were eligible for inclusion if they met dsm-iv criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder and had a history of tolerating drug drug within the preceding year. all patients provided written informed consent after the study details were explained in full. the university of cincinnati institutional review board approved this protocol. patients were excluded by the presence of any psy- chiatric disorders other than those speci_ed;

This study evaluated whether drug, an drug receptor II antagonist, affected the pharmacokinetics of drug. A randomized, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover, multiple-dosing study was conducted with 24 healthy male volunteers. Twelve subjects received 80-drug drug once daily for 7 days; later, they received 80-drug drug with 240-drug drug for 7 days. Twelve other subjects received the same drug in the opposite sequence. Blood samples were collected scheduled intervals for 24 hours after the last dosing to determine drug concentrations of drug drug, drug drug, 2-hydroxy drug drug, and 2-hydroxy drug drug. Compared with drug alone, coadministration of drug and drug increased the drug drug mean (95% confidence interval) drug concentration (Cmax,ss) by 1.89-fold (1.49-2.39) and the area under the concentration curve (AUC_,ss) by 1.19-fold (0.96-1.48). Fimasartan also increased the mean 2-hydroxy drug drug Cmax,ss and AUC_,ss by 2.45-fold (1.80-3.35) and 1.42-fold (1.09-1.85), respectively. The Cmax,ss and AUC_,ss of the drug forms of drug showed smaller changes than those observed for the drug forms. We showed that drug raised drug drug concentrations. In vitro tests suggested that this effect may have been mediated by drug inhibition of drug anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support,

9987702,The effects of drug on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug.,"The drug drug drug is clinically administered as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (R) and (S). Many relevant drug interactions with drug have been attributed to the specific metabolic inhibition of the elimination of the more pharmacologically active (S)-enantiomer. To investigate reports that drug can potentiate the drug effect of drug, 20 healthy male volunteers were each given single drug 20 drug doses of racemic drug on three separate occasions: (1) alone, (2) after 1 day of drug (4 g/d), and (3) after 2 weeks of drug (4 g/d). The urinary excretion pattern of drug and its metabolites was not significantly altered drug its course of administration. The (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of drug exhibited significantly different pharmacokinetic properties. However, drug did not alter the disposition of either (R)- or (S)-drug. All subjects exhibited a pharmacodynamic response to racemic drug. The response was not significantly altered in the presence of acute or chronic drug dosing, as assessed by drug time and drug VII concentrations.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized

12911366,The effects of concurrent drug therapy on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous drug.,"Midazolam is a commonly used anaesthetic agent and is metabolised by the 3A4 isoform of the drug P450 enzyme system. Atorvastatin is also metabolised by drug P450 3A4 and, in vitro, drug inhibits the drug P450 3A4-mediated metabolism of drug. We hypothesised that concurrent administration of drug and drug would result in altered drug pharmacokinetics. Fourteen patients scheduled to undergo general anaesthesia for elective surgery were recruited in a matched pair design to receive intravenous drug (0.15 drug.kg-1). Of these patients, seven were taking long-term drug. Atorvastatin patients demonstrated a greater area under the curve (889.4 (standard deviation 388.6) drug-h.drug-1) vs. control patients (629.1 (standard deviation 197.2) drug-h.drug-1) (p < 0.05). Patients taking drug also demonstrated a decreased clearance (0.18 (standard deviation 0.08) l-kg. h-1) vs. control patients (0.drug (standard deviation 0.08) l-kg.h-1) (p < 0.05).

19001559,The effects of drug and drug on the pharmacokinetics of the drug P450 2D6 substrate drug in healthy adults.,"The potential for drug P450 (CYP) 2D6 substrates to interact with drug (administered as drug succinate) and drug was evaluated. In an open-label, crossover study, 20 healthy volunteers (aged 21-50) were randomized to 2 series of 9 days each of drug (100 drug/d) or drug (20 drug/d), separated by a 5-day washout. The CYP2D6 substrate drug (50 drug) was administered alone on day 1 and coadministered on day 6 of dosing with either drug or drug. CYP2D6 genotype was determined at baseline. Based on least squares geometric mean ratios between reference (drug alone) and test treatments, drug produced minor increases in drug area under the drug concentration versus time curve (AUC; 36%) and peak drug concentration (C(max); 30%) (vs drug: 419%, 90%, respectively; both P < .001). Desvenlafaxine produced little change in 2-hydroxydesipramine AUC (16% increase) and C(max) (0%) versus drug (18% and 82% decreases, respectively; P = .008, P < .001, respectively), indicating that

initiation. all participants gave written informed consent in compliance with good clinical practice guidelines and in accordance with the declaration of helsinki; institutional review board approval was obtained. study design and protocol this was a single-center, randomized, open-label, 4-period crossover, inpatient study in healthy adult volunteers conducted at mds pharma services effects of drug and drug on drug (neptune, new jersey) to evaluate the effects of multiple doses of drug (100 drug/d) and drug (20 drug/d) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of a drug model substrate-drug, drug (50 drug). screening of participants, which occurred within 2 to drug days of study initiation, comprised a drug history, physical examination, assessment of vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ecg), serum preg- nancy test (women only), urinary drug and drug screen, and clinical laboratory tests. participants were required to have undergone a drug-hour fast prior to screening drug sample collection. following review of screening data, eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 drug to either treatment sequence a (drug/drug) or sequence b (drug/drug). randomized partici- pants were confined to the study center for 29 days. at study site check-in (day _1), participant eligi- bility was reviewed, vital signs and adverse events (aes) were recorded, a urine drug and drug screen was conducted, drug samples were obtained for clinical laboratory investigations, a serum preg- nancy test (women only) was performed, and drug genotyping was conducted. genotyping was performed for pharmacokinetic data analysis purposes; drug participant was excluded from the study based on drug genotype. in period 1, fol- lowing a drug-hour fast, all participants received a sin- gle 50-drug dose of drug administered with 240 drug room-temperature drug, followed by 120 hours of drug sample (5-drug) collection. breakfast was not given on this day; drug was allowed 4 hours after drug administration. in each of periods 2 and 4, each 9 days in drug, drug or drug was administered with 240 drug room- temperature drug within 5 minutes following breakfast. on one study day in each of periods 2 and 4 (days 11 and 25, respectively), drug or drug was coadministered with drug (50 drug) along with 240 drug room-temperature drug following a drug-hour fast. drug samples for pharma- cokinetic analysis were then collected for up to 120 hours. breakfast was not given on these days; drug was allowed 4 hours after test drug administration. period 3 (study days 16 to 19) was the washout phase. this 5-day washout period was deemed sufficient for both drug and drug, especially considering that this allowed for a drug-day period between the final test article administration in phase 2 and the administration of the drug probe in phase 4. on the final study day (day 29; there were drug early terminations), a complete physical examination was conducted, along with assessment of vital signs, an ae report, a serum pregnancy test (women only), and clinical laboratory investigations. participants were followed for up to 15 days after final adminis- tration of test drug to assess safety. throughout the study, participants were required to eat medium-drug standardized meals provided by the clinic. forty-eight hours prior to study initiation and throughout the study, participants were not per- mitted to consume or use drug-, drug-, or drug-containing products. men were not per- mitted to donate sperm during the course of the study and for the following 30 days, and sexually active men were required to use a condom with spermicidal jelly. participants were not permitted to use any hormonal treatment, including drug contra- ceptives or hormone replacement therapy or any drug drug during the study period. drug sample collection and analysis for analyzing drug concentrations of desvenlafax- ine, drug, drug, and 2-hydroxyde- sipramine, 5-drug drug samples were collected via an indwelling catheter or drug venipuncture into drug drug-treated drug collection tubes. if a catheter was used, approximately 0.5 drug was to be discarded before collecting the sample each time. samples for determination of drug and 2- hydroxydesipramine drug concentrations were collected on study days 1 to 5, 11 to 15, and 25 to 29 within 2 hours prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdosing. for determination of steady-state trough desven- lafaxine and drug drug concentrations, on days 11 and 12 (period 2) and days 25 and 26 (period 4), drug samples were collected within 30 minutes before drug administration. all samples were imme- diately placed on ice or refrigerated. within 50 minutes of collection, drug was separated by cen- trifugation and stored frozen at _20ï¿½c until analyses were performed. drug concentrations of drug, paroxe- tine, drug, and 2-hydroxydesipramine were determined with validated drug chromatographic (drug) methods using drug mass spectroscopic detection (drug/drug/drug). analyses for drug and drug were carried out at ba research international (houston, texas), and those for desi- pramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine were conducted at ppd development (richmond, virginia). for determination of drug and drug concentrations in drug, samples were analyzed in drug interactions 221 nichols et al runs consisting of calibration standards, quality con- trol samples, and participant samples. for desven- lafaxine, a drug precipitation extraction procedure was carried out, whereas for drug, a drug-drug extraction was performed. the internal standards employed for drug and drug were drug (50 drug/drug) and drug (30 drug/drug), respec- tively. samples were analyzed using an drug/drug/drug system (drug 3000 or 4000 with turbo ionspray detection, drug series 200 drug pump, series 200 autosampler and betabasic drug, 100 _ 2.1-mm ana- lytical column for drug and an aquasil c18, 100 _ 2.1-mm analytical column for paroxe- tine); positive ions were measured in multiple-reac- tion monitoring mode. data were acquired and integrated based on linear regression with 1/x2 weighting. the calibration curve and control data indicated acceptable performance of the assay drug- ods during analysis of study samples; upper and lower limits of quantification were 0.2 and 50.0 drug/drug for drug and 2.0 and 500.0 drug/drug for desven- lafaxine. interday variability of the assays was _7.2%. for determination of drug and 2-hydroxyde- sipramine concentrations in drug, a drug-drug extraction was performed. drug-d3 hydrochlo- ride and 2-hydroxydesipramine-d3 were used as internal standards. drug/drug/drug used positive ion turboionspray with multiple-reaction monitoring, and linear regression with 1/x2 weighting was used for determinations. the calibration curve and con- trol data indicated acceptable performance of the assay methods during analysis of study samples; upper and lower limits of quantification for both compounds were 0.25 and 100.0 drug/drug. interday variability of the assays was _6.8% for drug and _14.5% for 2-hydroxydesipramine.

nested drug- merase chain reaction (pcr) strategy and analyzed by primer extension and drug-assisted laser des- orption ionization time-of-flight analysis using drug- plexed methods developed and validated in the wyeth biomarker laboratory (wyeth research, collegeville, pennsylvania). detection of the drug*drug allele was performed using a commercially available taqman allelic discrimination assay (applied biosystems, foster city, california) according to the manufacturerï¿½s instructions. duplication (*xn) and deletion (*5) of the drug gene were determined using the commer- cially available drug deletion/duplication pcr assay kit (jurilab, finland) multiplex long pcr- based assay according to the manufacturerï¿½s instruc- tions. genotype call acceptance criteria using drug technologies were assigned according to the methods outlined in isler et al.drug drug*1 was defined in this study as the absence of the 12 drug alleles interrogated in this study (*2-*drug, *17, *29, and *41). duplication of either the *1 allele (*1xn) or *2 allele (*2xn) resulted in an ultrarapid metabolizer (um) phenotype prediction when paired with another functional allele (*1 or *2). participants possessing at least 1 functional allele (*1 or *2) in the absence of gene duplication were classi- fied as ems. participants possessing 2 decreased activity alleles (*9, *drug, *17, *29, and *41) or 1 decreased activity allele in combination with a null allele (*3, *4, *5, *6, *7, and *8) were assigned inter- mediate metabolizer (im) status. finally, participants possessing a combination of 2 null alleles were clas- sified as pms. assessment of metabolizer status statistical analysis drug genotypes of drug whole-drug samples were determined using internally developed drug- ods or commercially available assays. genomic dna was isolated from 400 ï¿½l of whole drug using the fuji quickgene 810 system (fujifilm life science, tokyo, japan) according to the manufacturerï¿½s instructions. drug phenotypes, yielding em and pm status/activity, were predicted via genotyping the following drug allelesï¿½*2 to *drug, *17, *29, *41ï¿½and by determining the duplication status (*xn) of the drug gene. internally developed genotyping assays specific to each allele were designed based on data from the homepage of the drug p450 (cyp) allele nomenclature descriptive statistics and statistical analyses were performed with drug version 9.1 statistical software package. the pharmacokinetic parameters for drug and 2-hydroxydesipramine (area under the drug concentration versus time curve [auc], peak drug concentration [cmax], time to cmax [tmax], and terminal-phase elimination half-life) were esti- mated using standard noncompartmental methods and characterized using mean

10771458,The effects of drug on drug pharmacokinetics--a placebo-controlled crossover study in healthy volunteers.,"To assess the effects of multiple drug doses of drug on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of drug drug HCl. This was a drug-day, open-label, randomized, crossover study in drug healthy subjects aged 18-31 years. Group 1 received drug drug 400 drug once daily for 6 days, followed by a 2 day wash-out period and 6 days of placebo administration. Group 2 received placebo followed by drug. Single drug doses of drug HCl 40 drug were administered on days 5 and 13 in both groups. Ziprasidone pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between placebo and drug administration periods. Co-administration of drug with drug was associated with a modest increase in drug exposure; mean drug AUC(0,infinity) increased by 33%, from 899 drug drug(-1) h with placebo to 1199 drug drug(-1) h with drug. Mean Cmax increased by 34%, from 89 drug drug(-1) to 119 drug drug(-1), respectively. The treatment effect on both of these parameters was statistically significant (P<0.02). Most adverse events were of mild intensity. There were drug serious adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, abnormal ECGs, or clinically significant alterations in vital signs throughout the study. The concurrent administration of drug and drug led to modest, statistically significant increases in drug exposure, although the changes seen were not considered clinically relevant. This suggests that other inhibitors of CYP3A4 are unlikely to significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of drug.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,methods subjects allergic except fourteen healthy individuals men women years old weighing kg within ideal body weight age height gender frame enrolled study subjects evidence history clinically signi cant untreated asymptomatic seasonal allergies haematological drug endocrine pulmonary gastrointestinal cardiovascular hepatic psychiatric neurological disease including forms epilepsy excluded smokers subjects condition could affect drug absorption subjects known drug drug dependence drug allergies also excluded women required surgically sterilized least years postmenopausal using reliable contraception least months subjects excluded taken drug drug except drug drug thecounter recreational drug within weeks drug drug within weeks study entry drug concomitant drug allowed study the study institutional review board approval all subjects gave informed written consent drug when drug administered subjects eat sign measurements drink caffeinated decaffeinated beverages h dosing lie except vital pharmacokinetic sampling analysis drug samples collected morning dosing days tubes containing drug determination trough drug concentrations drug drug separated whole drug samples centrifugation within h collection on days drug dosing days drug samples collected plain tubes preservative drug serum separator drug dosing h morning drug dose these samples allowed drug room temperature extract serum measurement drug concentration all samples stored x20u c analysed either drug drug concentrations serum drug concentrations determined using h p l c assay using solid phase extraction procedure ultraviolet u v detection this assay dynamic range drug mlx concentrations drug mlx reported drug mlx trough drug drug concentrations also assayed using validated h p l c method u v detection this assay dynamic range drug mlx protocol data analysis study following screening this randomized open label placebo controlled crossover subjects randomized two groups subjects group received once daily drug drug drug drug morning day increased drug days after day wash out period days received placebo days subjects group treated exactly group except received placebo days drug days single drug doses drug hcl drug administered days during drug day study period subjects received drug placebo outpatient drug however subjects housed research facility continuous drug supervision least h prior h dosing drug days drug administered drug drug immediately consumption standard drug drug breakfast drug placebo taken drug drug light breakfast except day group day group co administered the effect drug drug pharmacokinetics assessed comparing pharmacokinetic parameters days treatment groups drug observed serum concentrations drug cmax time cmax occurred tmax determined directly drug data the terminal elimination phase rate constant lz estimated individual concentration time curves using least squares regression analysis data obtained log linear phase the terminal phase half life drug tk z calculated ln 2 lz mean half life drug estimated ln 2 mean lz drug area concentration time curve auc 0 determined sum auc 0 t auc t auc 0 t estimated using linear trapezoidal approximation time last sample quanti able concentrations drug auc t estimated cpest lz cpest estimated concentration time based regression analysis log concentration time curve 72s f blackwell science ltd br j clin pharmacol suppl 71s 76s an estimated subjects seven receive drug seven receive placebo required detect difference change auc 0 two groups power signi cance level an analysis variance anova model containing sequence period treatment effects used log transformed auc 0 cmax analyse natural proc glm sas1 signi cance level differences drug pharmacokinetic parameters concomitant placebo drug treatments estimated comparing adjusted means groups variances covariances con dence limits calculated using sas1 lsmeans function tolerability assessments tolerability assessments study clinical laboratory tests including drug function tests alkaline phosphatase aspartate aminotransferase sgot alanine aminotransferase sgpt drug drug h day days vital sign measurements drug pressure pulse rate days physical examinations performed screening completion discontinuation study adverse events occurring study treatment days last day dosing recorded using standard costart de nitions classi ed according investigator s intensity mild moderate severe causal relationship study drug assessment,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
16027406,The effects of multiple doses of fenofibrate on the pharmacokinetics of drug and its 3alpha-hydroxy isomeric metabolite.,"Published data indicate that coadministration of multiple doses of the fibrate drug, gemfibrozil, led to a 202% increase in drug systemic exposure (area under the drug concentration-time curve, AUC). To evaluate the effects of another fibrate drug, fenofibrate, on the pharmacokinetics of drug, 24 healthy subjects took drug (40 drug once daily) on study days 1 to 15 and fenofibrate (160 drug once daily) on study days 6 to 15. Blood samples were collected for 24 hours after dosing on days 5, 6, and 15. Plasma concentrations of drug and its active metabolite, 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-drug, were measured, and pharmacokinetics was assessed. Safety assessments were based on adverse events, physical examinations, electrocardiogram results, vital signs, and clinical laboratory testing. Safety results were unremarkable. Coadministration of fenofibrate had modest effects on drug and 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-drug systemic exposures (AUC). Increases in drug systemic exposures (19%-28%, on average) and 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-drug systemic exposures (24%-39%, on average) were observed upon coadministration, but individual changes were variable. Pravastatin and 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-drug systemic exposures were not statistically significantly different following the 1st and 10th doses of fenofibrate.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal

elimination rate constant(_z), and the corresponding terminal elimination halflife(t1/2). the auc24 was calculated using the trapezoidalrule, and _z was calculated fromthe slope of theleast squares linear regression of the logarithms of thedrug concentration versus time data from the terminallog-linear phase of the profile. for drug only,the apparent drug clearance (cl/f, where f is thebioavailability) was also calculated.paired t tests were performed for cmax, auc24, tmax,and _z at a significance level of .05 to assess the effectsof fenofibrate coadministration. comparisons weremade for each of study days 6 and 15 with study day 5and for study day 15 with study day 6. logarithmictransformation was employed for auc24 and cmax. drugstatistical analyseswere performed for cmin because theminimumconcentrations were below the lloq for themajority of subjects for both analytes. the t tests wereperformed using proc univariate on drug, version8.2 (sasinstitute,cary,nc).the paired t test approachwas preferred drug analysis of variance (anova) withpost hoc comparisons and correction formultiple comparisonsbecause the anova required additional assumptionsregarding the homogeneity of the variancesof the dependent variables.in connection with the paired t tests for the logarithmsof auc24 and cmax, a point estimate and 90%confidence interval for exposure during fenofibratecoadministration relative to exposure for drugalone were provided. the point estimate and confidenceinterval endpoints were obtained by exponentiatingthe

19585395,The effects of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug drug-release tablets.,"Co-morbid drug and psychiatric conditions are common in individuals with schizophrenia. As such, selecting drug drug with a drug potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial, as many are extensively metabolized by hepatic drug P450 (CYP) isozymes. This randomized, crossover study examined the effects of drug (a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetic parameters of a single dose of the novel drug agent, drug drug-release tablets (drug ER), in healthy subjects. The mean C (max) and AUC of drug were slightly higher and drug clearance was slightly lower following co-administration of drug ER with drug. There was a drug of geometric treatment means of 116.48% for AUC (infinity) [90% CI: 104.49-129.84]. However, the increase in drug exposure to drug was not considered clinically relevant. The incidence of adverse events was lower when subjects received the combination of drug ER and drug compared with drug alone. Results suggest that drug clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction occurs when drug and drug ER are co-administered and, therefore, initiation or discontinuation of concomitant treatment with CYP2D6-inhibiting drug does not appear to warrant an adjustment in drug ER dosage.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods subjects sixty men aged

A 7.5-drug dose of drug was ingested on the first day, 0.05 drug/kg was administered IV on the fourth day, and 7.5 drug orally on the sixth day. Itraconazole drug the clearance of IV drug by 69% and drug drug the clearance of IV drug by 51% (P < 0.001). A single dose of drug and drug increased the area under the drug drug concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] 3.5-fold (P < 0.001) and the peak concentration two-fold (P < 0.05) compared to placebo. On the sixth day the AUC(0-infinity) of drug drug was almost seven times greater with drug (P < 0.001) and 3.6 times greater with drug (P < 0.001) than without the antimycotics. The psychomotor effects of drug were also profoundly increased (P < 0.001). The psychomotor tests demonstrated only a weak interaction between the antimycotics and IV drug. When bolus doses of drug are given for short- time sedation, the effect of drug is not increased to a clinically significant degree by drug and drug, and it can be used in drug doses.

9602962,The influence of drug on the disposition kinetics of the drug drug.,"The influence of drug on the disposition pharmacokinetics of the drug drug, drug, and its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, was examined in 18 healthy young men and women. The steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles of drug and O-desmethylvenlafaxine were evaluated during a 24-hour period after 5 days of treatment with drug (50 drug three times a day) and during a second 24-hour period after 5 days of combination treatment with drug (50 drug three times a day) and drug (800 drug once a day). The apparent drug clearance of drug decreased significantly in the presence of drug and the average steady-state drug concentration of drug increased significantly in the presence of drug, but there were drug changes in the corresponding concentrations of the active metabolite. However, O-desmethylvenlafaxine exhibits pharmacologic activity that is approximately equimolar to that of drug, and the sum of drug plus O-desmethylvenlafaxine drug concentrations was increased by an average of only 13%. Therefore, the effect of drug coadministration is not expected to result in clinically important alterations in the response to drug in patients with depression.

9797793,The interaction of drug with drug and drug.,"Lovastatin is oxidized by drug P4503A to active metabolites but drug is active alone and is not metabolized by drug P450. Diltiazem, a substrate and a potent inhibitor of drug P4503A drug, is commonly coadministered with drug-lowering agents. This was a balanced, randomized, open-label, 4-way crossover study in drug healthy volunteers, with a 2-week washout period between the phases. Study arms were (1) administration of a single dose of 20 drug drug, (2) administration of a single dose of 20 drug drug, (3) administration of a single dose of drug after administration of 120 drug drug twice a day for 2 weeks, and (4) administration of a single dose of drug after administration of 120 drug drug twice a day for 2 weeks. Diltiazem significantly (P < .05) increased the drug area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of drug from 3607 +/- 1525 drug/drug/min (mean +/- SD) to 12886 +/- 6558 drug/drug/min and drug serum concentration (Cmax) from 6 +/- 2 to 26 +/- 9 drug/drug but did not influence the elimination half-life. Diltiazem did not affect the drug AUC, Cmax, or half-life of drug. The average steady-state serum concentrations of drug were not significantly different between the drug (130 +/- 58 drug/drug) and drug (110 +/- 30 drug/drug) study arms. Diltiazem greatly increased the drug concentration of drug, but the magnitude of this effect was much greater than that predicted by the systemic serum concentration, suggesting that this interaction is a first-pass rather than a systemic event. The magnitude of this effect and the frequency of coadministration suggest that caution is necessary when administering drug and drug together. Further studies should explore whether this interaction abrogates the efficacy of drug or enhances toxicity and whether it occurs with other drug P4503A4-metabolized 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, such as drug, drug, and drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",methods clinical protocol drug healthy volunteers men women provided written informed consent approved institutional review board indiana university indianapolis ind all volunteers within ideal body weight mean f drug weight f kg mean age f years table i the history physical examination ecg hematologic biochemical tests showed abnormal findings none volunteers histories smoking drug abuse none women taking drug drug drug drug allowed within days study study drug study drug allowed days study subjects abstained drug containing beverages days throughout study the study conducted outpatient drug except drug drug dosing days a randomized 4 way crossover design applied the arms study administration single dose drug drug orally administration single dose drug drug orally administration single dose drug orally weeks drug drug drug sr twice day administration single dose drug orally weeks drug drug drug sr twice day each arm separated minimum weeks drug samples determination drug drug serum concentrations obtained l hours dosing the final dose drug administered hour drug drug dose samples obtained times hours determination drug concentrations the serum samples stored 70 c assayed drug assays diltiuzem drug concentrations serum samples quantified hplc method modification described yeung et al 25 drug resolved internal standard drug mobile phase drug mol l drug drug tetraethylammonium drug drug drug drug tetrahydrofuran drug drug the mobile phase flow set drug min pm cs column cm x mm drug beckman instruments san ramon calif detection ultraviolet absorbance wavelength nm a pl aliquot serum extracted drug drug basification pl drug bicarbonate io drug standard curves prepared range concentrations drug drug quantification achieved linear regression peak area ratios standard concentrations quality controls prepared described concentrations drug drug the limit detection drug drug the intraday interday variability less drug drug serum concentrations drug drug determined method used gas chromatography mass spectrometry described detail morris et al 26 the drug drug quantitatively converted free drug base hydrolysis drug used internal standard a structural analog sq bristol myers squibb princeton nj used internal standard drug the pentafluorobenzyl trimethylsilyl derivatives free acids quantified use negative ion chemical ionization finnigan ssq fragment ions m z drug drug respectively correspond loss pentafluorobenzyl group the detection limit compounds drug drug all serum concentrations reported drug drug equivalents free drug data analysis the area serum concentration time curve auc last measured sample determined combination log trapezoidal linear trapezoidal methods drug the terminal elimination rate constant k determined unweighted log linear regression terminal serum concentration time points the auc extrapolated infinity use drug terminal serum concentration k half life determined 0 693 k steady state drug concentrations determined drug analyzed 2 sided student test paired values significance level p i stepwise multiple linear regression performed jmp statistical package model discrimination using f test drug institute car y nc the relationship area serum concentration time curve drug presence auc absence auc drug average drug serum concentration i examined means unweighted linear regression equation l auc auc i k drug equilibrium inhibition constant putative inhibitor drug this relationship assumes inhibition competitive nature attributable hepatic extraction hepatic elimination consistent well stirred model hepatic clearance it noted drug substrates drug may experience significant gut wall elimination therefore equation strictly valid for substrates equation applicable auc auc fg fg i k f f intestinal wall availabilities presence absence inhibitor,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
10741630,The interaction of drug with drug.,"Simvastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase that is used as a drug-lowering agent and is metabolized by drug P450 3A (CYP3A) drug. Diltiazem is a substrate and an inhibitor of CYP3A drug and is commonly coadministered with drug-lowering agents such as drug. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug. A fixed-order study was conducted in drug healthy volunteers with a 2-week washout period between the phases. In one arm of the study, a single 20-drug dose of drug was administered orally; the second arm entailed administration of a single 20-drug dose of drug orally after 2 weeks of treatment with 120 drug drug twice a day. Diltiazem significantly increased the mean peak serum concentration of drug by 3.6-fold (P < .05) and drug drug by 3.7-fold (P < .05). Diltiazem also significantly increased the area under the serum concentration-time curve of drug 5-fold (P < .05) and the elimination half-life 2.3-fold (P < .05). There was drug change in the time to peak concentration for drug and drug drug. Diltiazem coadministration resulted in a significant interaction with drug, probably by inhibiting CYP3A-mediated metabolism. Concomitant use of drug or other potent inhibitors of CYP3A with drug should be avoided, or close clinical monitoring should be used.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S.

5.3 years (table i). drug abnormalities were found in history, physical examination, ecg, or drug- tologic and biochemical tests. none of the volunteers had a history of smoking or drug abuse, and none of the women were taking drug drug. drug and drug were not allowed for 7 days before or dur- ing the study. drug study drug was allowed for 30 days before the study. the subjects abstained from drug- containing beverages for 2 days before and throughout the study. the study was conducted on an outpatient drug except for the drug dosing days. a fixed-order design was applied. the two arms of the study were (1) administration of a single drug 20-drug dose of drug and (2) administration of a single drug dose of drug after 2 weeks of 120 drug drug (drug sr) two times a day. the two arms were separated by 2 weeks. after subjects fasted overnight, drug was administered at approxi- mately 8 am on the study day, and a standard lunch was provided at midday. drug samples for determination of drug serum concentrations were obtained at 0, 1ï¿½4, 1ï¿½2, 3ï¿½4, 1, 11ï¿½2, 2, 21ï¿½2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. drug samples obtained at 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours were also used

analytes from 0.5 drug drug serum with use of drug and drug hydroxy drug as internal stan- dards. sample extracts were reconstituted and analyzed by turbo ion-spray drug chromatography/drug mass spectrometry (drug/drug/drug) in the positive ion mode. the assay demonstrated a lower limit of quantitation of 0.5 drug/drug for both analytes with a 0.5 drug sample volume, and calibration curves were linear up to 100 drug/drug for both analytes. the intraday and interday pre- cision and accuracy were within 8% and 7%, respec- tively. drug and drug drug were stable in drug serum in an ice-drug bath (about _10ï¿½c) for up to 24 hours, after three freeze-thaw cycles, and in reconstitution drug for up to 96 hours at 4ï¿½c. data analysis. the area under the serum concentra- tion_time curve (auc) up to the last measured sample was determined by a combination of log-trapezoidal and linear-trapezoidal methods.33 the terminal elimi- nation rate constant (ke) was determined by unweighted log-linear regression of at least drug terminal serum con- centration_time points. the auc(ï¿½) was obtained by extrapolation to infinity with use of the drug of the ter- minal serum concentration to ke. the percentage of the area extrapolated beyond the latest measured concentra- tion was 11% or less for drug. half-life (t1ï¿½2) was determined from 0.693/ke. steady-state drug concen- trations were determined from the 0- to 12-hour auc divided by the 12-hour dosing interval. all data are expressed as mean and drug and were analyzed by the two- sided student t test for paired values at a significance level of p < .05. stepwise, multiple linear regression was per- formed by the jmp statistical package with model dis- crimination by use of an f-test (drug institute, cary, nc). the relationship between area under the serum con- centration_time curve of drug in the presence [auc(ï¿½)drug] and absence [auc(ï¿½)control] of dilti- azem and average drug serum concentration (i) was examined by use of unweighted linear regression with equation 1.34 auc(ï¿½)drug/auc(ï¿½)control = (1 + i/drug) (1) in which drug is the equilibrium inhibition constant of the putative inhibitor drug. this relationship assumes that (1) the inhibition is competitive in nature, (2) the loss of drug during absorption and elimination is caused by hepatic extraction alone, and (3) hepatic elimination is consistent with the well-stirred model of hepatic clearance. it should be noted that drug substrates, such as drug, may experience significant gut wall elimination and therefore equation 1 is not strictly valid. for such substrates equation 2 is applicable.29 auc(ï¿½)drug/auc(ï¿½)control = (fg*/fg) ï¿½ (1 + i/drug) (2) in which fg* and fg are the intestinal wall availabili- ties in the

19552747,The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug in combination with drug in healthy volunteers.,"Ambrisentan is an drug, drug drug-based endothelin receptor antagonist often co-administered with drug to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for drug to affect drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In this open-label cross-drug study, 22 healthy subjects received a single dose of racemic drug 25 drug alone and after 8 days of drug drug drug once daily. Assessments included exposure (AUC(0-last)) and drug drug concentration (C(max)) for R- and S-drug, and International Normalized Ratio drug observed value (INR(max)) and area under the curve (INR(AUC(0-last))). The effects of drug on drug steady-state pharmacokinetics and the safety of drug/drug co-administration were assessed. Data are presented as geometric mean ratios. Ambrisentan had drug significant effects on the AUC(0-last) of R-drug [104.7; 90% confidence interval (CI) 101.7, 107.7) or S-drug (101.6; 90% CI 98.4, 105.0). Similarly, drug had drug significant effects on the C(max) of R-drug (91.6; 90% CI 86.2, 97.4) or S-drug (89.9; 90% CI 84.8, 95.3). Consistent with these observations, little pharmacodynamic change was observed for INR(max) (85.3; 90% CI 82.4, 88.2) or INR(AUC(0-last)) (93.0; 90% CI 90.8, 95.3). In addition, co-administration of drug did not alter drug steady-state pharmacokinetics. Adverse events were infrequent, and there were drug bleeding adverse events. Multiple doses of drug had drug clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of drug. Therefore, significant dose adjustments of either drug are unlikely to be required with co-administration.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","methods in this open-label cross-drug study, 22 healthy subjects received a single dose of racemic drug 25 drug alone and after 8 days of drug drug drug once daily. assessments included exposure (auc0_last) and drug drug concentration (cmax) for r- and s-drug, and international normalized drug drug observed value (inrmax) and area under the curve (inrauc(0_last)). the effects of drug on drug steady-state pharmacokinetics and the safety of drug/drug co-administration were assessed. data are presented as geometric mean ratios. methods pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is a serious and life-threatening disease characterized by progressive vasoconstriction, vascular remodelling and in situ throm- bosis [1, 2]. disease progression is associated with signi_- cant resistance and sustained elevations in pulmonary artery pressure, which ultimately lead to right ventricular failure and death [1, 3]. increases in pulmonary vascular prothrombotic changes, including increased platelet activity, are characteristic of pah [2]; therefore, anticoagu- lants such as drug are commonly administered to prevent thrombus formation in this patient population [4]. the pharmacodynamic response to drug includes increased drug time (pt), which is often expressed as an international normalized drug (inr) [5]. drug is administered as a racemic mixture of r(+) and s(_) enantiomers, and the s-enantiomer is approximately two- to _vefold more potent than the r-enantiomer with respect to drug activity [6]. both drug enanti- omers are metabolized in the drug by drug p450 (cyp) isoenzymes: r-drug is primarily metabolized by drug and drug, whereas s-drug is primarily metabolized by drug [7]. concomitant therapies that alter cyp enzyme activities may alter the pharmaco- kinetic exposure of drug and signi_cantly affect drug- drug time as measured by inr. decreased inr could potentially lead to a higher risk of thromboembolism, while increased inr could result in signi_cant bleeding episodes. endothelin receptor antagonists (eras) have emerged as a promising class of therapeutic agents for pah [4]. drug and drug are drug-based eras that have proven effective in the treatment of pah [8, 9]; however, both drug have been shown to alter drug metabolism by affecting the activity of drug and drug. drug is a once-daily, orally active, pro- panoic drug-based, receptor subtype a (eta) drug era that is approved for the treatment of pah. drug has been shown to improve exercise capacity, delay time to clinical worsening, reduce disease symptoms, and improve cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in patients with pah [10_12]. unlike drug and drug, drug does not inhibit drug or drug and is therefore unlikely to have drug_drug interactions with drug and other cyp-metabolized drug [11]. this study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of multiple doses of drug on the pharma- cokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single racemic dose of drug, as well as to assess the effects of drug on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug. in addition, the safety and tolerability of drug and drug co-administration were evaluated. induce or 528 / 67:5 / br j clin pharmacol subjects men and women aged 18_55 years with a body mass index of 18.5_29.9, weight _50 kg, and in good health were eli- gible for this study. determination of health was based on a comprehensive pre-study examination that included drug history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ecg) and clinical laboratory tests. subjects were required to be nontobacco users, and agreed to discontinue the intake of drug, drug, drug products, drug, and leafy green vegetables. at screening, subjects were also required to have pt, inr and partial thromboplastin time values within drug limits, serum aspartate aminotrans- ferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations <1x the upper limit of drug, and negative laboratory results for drug immunode_ciency virus, drug b and hepa- titis c. drug subjects were required to be surgically sterile by hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. subjects were excluded if they had current evidence or history of drug dependence, bleeding disorders, sensi- tivity to drug or drug, or signi_cant allergies. subjects were also excluded if they had donated or received drug products within 30 days prior to the _rst dose of study drug, or had received any drug, herbal remedies, drug or drug that were known to interfere with cyp enzyme metabolism within 2 weeks prior to the _rst dose of study drug. all participants provided written informed consent. the study was reviewed and approved by aspire independent review board (san diego, ca, usa). study design/treatments this was a phase 1, open-label, _xed-sequence, two-way, crossover, single-centre study to evaluate the potential for a pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interaction of multiple doses of drug with a single dose of drug in healthy subjects (figure 1). following a screen- ing period of 21 days, subjects were administered a single dose of racemic drug 25 drug (bristol-myers squibb,prin- ceton, nj, usa) on day 1. on days 5 to 16, subjects received a single daily dose of drug drug drug (gilead sciences, inc., formerly myogen, inc., westminster, co, usa). on day 13, subjects were administered a single drug-drug dose of drug together with a single 25-drug dose of war- farin. all study drug were administered under fasted conditions and under the supervision of clinical study site personnel. this study was performed in compli- ance with the principles of good clinical practice and the declaration of helsinki. pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics drug samples for the pharmacokinetic assessments of r- and s-drug were collected at the following times relative to the day 1 and day 13 drug doses: predose (_30 min prior), and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, drug, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72 lack of drug and drug drug interaction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 drug 11 12 13 drug 15 16 17 18 days drug 25 drug drug drug drug od drug 25 drug (drug pk/pd) (drug pk/pd) abs ( ) pk ( abs ) pk ( drug trough pk ) figure 1 study dosing regimen and drug sampling schedule. single doses of racemic drug 25 drug were administered on days 1 and 13, and drug drug drug was administered once daily from day 5 to day 16. od, once daily;

3428348,The pharmacokinetics of drug after chronic administration in adults.,"We have studied the pharmacokinetics of the drug-mycotic drug in seven patients who took it for 1-6 months at a dose of 200 drug daily. The mean elimination half-life of the drug was 3.3 h, and although the drug was given only once daily, a satisfactory clinical response was obtained in all seven individuals. Only a small fraction of the absorbed drug (mean 0.22%) was excreted unchanged in the urine, suggesting almost complete metabolism. Our results support the concept that drug-mycotic activity in the tissues continues after the drug drug concentration has fallen below a critical level.

18832427,The pharmacokinetics of standard drug with drug as adjunctive therapy: studies in healthy subjects and in patients with major depressive disorder.,"Possible effects of the drug drug drug on the pharmacokinetics of standard drug therapies (ADTs) were assessed in two open-label, drug-randomised studies in healthy subjects (Studies 1 and 2) and two placebo-controlled studies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 3 and 4). Healthy subjects received drug 75 drug/day (Study 1; N = 38) or drug drug drug/ day (Study 2; N = 25) with the addition of drug drug-20 drug/day (drug drug/day fixed dose in Study 2) for drug days. Patients with MDD (N = 498; Studies 3 and 4) received drug (drug-20 drug/day), drug (20-40 drug/day), drug controlled-release (37.5-50 drug/day), drug (100-150 drug/day) or drug drug-release (150-225 drug/day) for 8 weeks plus placebo. Incomplete responders were randomised (1:1) to placebo or adjunctive drug 2-20 drug/day. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of ADTs. Plasma concentration-time data from Studies 3 and 4 were combined for statistical analysis. In healthy subjects, point estimates [90% CI] for the ratios of geometric means of C( max) (drug 1.148 [1.083-1.217]; drug 1.04 [0.99-1.09]) and AUC(TAU) (drug 1.183 [1.130-1.238]; drug 1.07 [1.04-1.11]) indicated drug meaningful increase in ADT exposure in the presence of drug. In patients, point estimates for mean drug concentration ratios indicated drug substantial effect of drug on any ADT drug 0.970 [0.911-1.033], drug 1.177 [1.049-1.321], drug 0.730 [0.598-0.892], drug 0.958 [0.887-1.035] or drug 0.966 [0.887-1.051].

marcus, et al., 2008). briefly, enrolled outpatients were aged 18_65 years with a major depressive episode that had lasted _8 weeks without an adequate response to adt (defined as a <50% reduction in severity of depressive symptoms when assessed by the massa- chusetts general hospital drug treatment response questionnaire within the current depressive episode). study design studies studies 1 and 2 these were open-label, drug-randomised, phase i that assessed the effects of drug (drugï¿½) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug (drugï¿½ xr) or drug (drugï¿½) as well as the safety and tolerability of drug when co-administered with these adts. the same batches of each drug were used throughout both studies. in both studies, patients received adts for a period prior to drug administration to allow steady-state concentrations to be achieved. in study 1, following a 28-day screening phase, eligible sub- jects received drug drug 75 drug/day for 4 days (days _4 to _1). a tolerability assessment was then conducted (study day 1). additional treatment with drug was initiated for drug days (day +1 to day +drug), subject to tolerability, during which patients continued to receive the same dose of venlafax- ine. the initial dose of drug was drug drug/day, given for 3 days, followed by titration of the dose to 15 drug/day for 4 days and 20 drug/day for 7 days. further tolerability assessments were made immediately before each titration step, and dose reduction was allowed for tolerability. subjects who were unable to tolerate either adt, or who were unable to tolerate drug doses of at least drug drug/day, were discontinued. the design of study 2 was similar, except that subjects received drug drug drug/day for 7 days (day _7 to day _1) before the addition of once-daily drug drug drug/day on study day 1 for a further drug days (day +1 to day +drug). studies 3 and 4 these were identically designed multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of aripi- prazole as adjunctive therapy in patients with mdd. the design for studies 3 and 4 is described in detail elsewhere (ber- man, et al., 2007; marcus, et al., 2008). briefly, during an 8-week, prospective treatment phase to establish inadequate response to standard adt, patients were assigned to single- blind placebo plus one of the following open-label adts (with indicated target doses that needed to be achieved by the end of the third treatment week): drug (10_20 drug/day), drug (20_40 drug/day), drug controlled-release (cr) (37.5_50 drug/day), drug (100_150 drug/day) or drug drug-release (150_225 drug/day). adt were supplied by a centralized vendor, and assignment to a particular adt was based on the patientï¿½s drug history, previous experience with adt treatment and the clinical judgment of the study physician. drug was manufactured in bulk by the study sponsor and several batches were used due to the large patient population. patients who met criteria for an incomplete response to adt at week 8 entered a 6-week, double-blind treatment phase in which they continued the same fixed-dose adt and were randomised (1:1) to either adjunctive placebo or aripipra- drug (2_20 drug/day; or 2_15 drug/day for patients receiving drug- etine or drug cr, due to the known increase in aripipra- drug levels with drug inhibition). patients who were unable to tolerate treatment were discontinued. assessments in studies 1 and 2, an evaluation was performed before initia- tion of drug to ensure that the subjects were adequately tolerating the adt alone. safety and tolerability assessments included adverse event (ae) monitoring, measurement of vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms and labora- drug pharmacokinetics with drug 3 tory test parameters. pharmacokinetic variables for the adts (drug, its active metabolite o-desmethylvenlafaxine [drug] and drug) included drug observed drug concentration (cmax), trough observed drug concentration (cmin), time of drug observed drug concentration (tmax) and area under the concentration_time curve drug 24 h (auctau). drug samples for pharmacokinetic measurements were collected drug a 24-h period on days 1 (for drug, drug, or drug monotherapy pharmacokinetics) and drug (for drug, drug, or drug adjunctive to aripipra- drug pharmacokinetics) and pre-dose or at clock-matched times on days drug and 15 for drug and drug-drug pharmacokinetics for an assessment of drug steady-state conditions. efficacy and safety assessments for studies 3 and 4 are described previously (berman, et al., 2007; marcus, et al., 2008) and not reported here. drug samples were obtained for adt (and, where applicable, active metabolite) drug con- centration measurements of study treatments at weeks 4, 6 and 8 during treatment with adt alone and at weeks 12, 13 and drug during double-blind addition of adjunctive drug or placebo. drug assessment of drug or drug- drug drug concentrations was conducted in these studies as drug was presumed to be at steady state after 2 weeks of once-daily dosing. the timing of the drug sample collection at each visit was not controlled with respect to the time of adt dosing. thus, it was possible drug samples were collected at different times post-dose at each visit. pharmacokinetic analysis drug samples were assayed by pharmatical product develop- drug, inc.

Eleven healthy young subjects aged 18-45 years were given single drug doses of drug 40 drug on three occasions at least 7 days apart. On one occasion drug was administered alone, on another occasion drug was co-administered with drug drug 800 drug and on a third occasion drug was co-administered with drug Maalox(R). The administration of drug increased the drug AUC(0,infinity) by 6% but there were drug statistically significant differences in Cmax, tmax or lambda(z) between the drug+drug group and the drug group. The administration of Maalox did not produce any statistically significant differences in AUC(0,infinity), Cmax, tmax or lambda(z) between the drug+Maalox group and the drug group. The pharmacokinetics of drug are not affected by concurrent administration of drug or Maalox.

18520598,The role of drug P2C19 in R-drug pharmacokinetics and its interaction with drug.,"Previous studies reported drug to be an inhibitor of drug P450 (CYP) 2C19 and suggested the pharmacokinetic interaction of drug with R-drug. The aim of this study was to compare possible effects of drug on the stereoselective pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug between CYP2C19 genotypes. Seventeen subjects, of whom drug were homozygous extensive metabolizers (hmEMs) and seven were poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, were enrolled in this randomized crossover study, and they ingested 20 drug drug or placebo once daily for 11 days. On day 7, they administered a single dose of drug drug racemic drug. The drug concentrations of drug enantiomers and drug time expressed as international normalized drug were monitored up to 120 hours. During the placebo phase, area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) and elimination half-life (t1/2) of R-drug in PMs was significantly greater than those in hmEMs (AUC[0-infinity], 42,938/34,613 drug h/mL [PM/hmEM], P = 0.004; t1/2, 48.8/40.8 hours [PM/hmEM], P = 0.013). Omeprazole treatment significantly increased the AUC(0-infinity) (41,387 drug h/mL, P = 0.004) and t1/2 (46.4 hours, P = 0.017) of R-drug in hmEMs to levels comparable to those in the PMs. There were drug differences in S-drug pharmacokinetics between the CYP2C19 genotypes (AUC[0-infinity], 15,851/16,968 drug*h/mL [PM/hmEM]; t1/2, 22.7/25.4 h [PM/hmEM]), or between the two treatment phases (AUC[0-infinity], drug,756/18,166 drug h/mL [PM/hmEM]; t1/2, drug.0/25.4 hours [PM/hmEM] in the drug phase) as well as drug effects. These results indicate that CYP2C19 activity was one of determinants on the R-drug disposition because the pharmacokinetics of drug enantiomers were different between the CYP2C19 genotypes and the drug affected the R-drug pharmacokinetics of CYP2C19 in only hmEMs. However, the phamacodynamic effect of the interaction of drug with drug would be of minor clinical significance.",Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,"subjects seventeen healthy japanese volunteers (12 males and five females) consisting of drug cyp2c19 homozygous ems (hmems) and seven pms were enrolled in this study after giving written informed consent. subjects previously underwent a cyp2c19 genotyping test by use of a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method with allele-specific primer for identifying the cyp2c19 wild-type (*1) gene and the two mutated alleles, cyp2c19*2 (*2) in exon 5 and cyp2c19*3 (*3), in exon 4.11 drug genotype was also determined,12 and only drug*1/*1 subjects were included in the study. the mean (ï¿½ standard deviation) values of age and body weight of the volunteers were 25.5 (ï¿½1.9) years (range, 23-30 years) and 60.8 (ï¿½8.5) kg (range, 45-80 kg), respectively. each subject was physically drug by clinical examination and routine laboratory testing and had drug history of significant drug illness or hypersensitivity to any drug. this study was approved by the ethics committee of hirosaki university school of drug.study protocolsa randomized, double-blind, two-phase (placebo and drug treatment) crossover study with a washout period of at least 2 weeks was carried out. the order of two phases was randomly assigned to each subject: eight subjects (five hmems and three pms) started the placebo phase first and the drug did the drug phase first. a capsule containing a 20-drug drug tablet (omepral;

Over a one-to two-week period, drug doses were escalated to 300 drug twice daily (bid). Patients were then treated for at least 7 days at the target drug dose and subsequently entered into the combination therapy period, receiving drug (7.5 drug, bid), drug (3 drug, bid), or drug (200 drug, bid) for 8.5 days (after 3 days of dose escalation). Key assessments included the pharmacokinetics of drug at steady state (area under the curve within a dosing interval [AUCtSS], drug [CmaxSS], and minimum [CminSS] observed drug concentrations, and drug clearance [Cl/f]), as well as the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale scores and safety evaluations. Neither drug drug drug had significant effects on drug pharmacokinetics. However, drug produced statistically significant changes, decreasing the least squares means values of the AUCtSS, CmaxSS, and CminSS by 40%, 47%, and 31%, respectively, and increasing Cl/f by 68%.

reversed-phase hplc with uv detection for drug (limit of quantitation, 1.00_100 drug/drug, zeneca drug, wilmington, delaware); and drug-phase hplc with uv detection for thiorid- azine (limit of quantitation, 5.00_1500 drug/drug, phoenix in- ternational life sciences, inc, montreal, quebec). analytical methods were speci_c against known me- tabolites of the given analyte, common drug, ben- ztropine mesylate, and drug hydrate. in addition, the method used for drug analysis was speci_c against the other analytes, several drug, drug- mazine, _uoxetine, and drug, while the methods used for the three concomitant agents were speci_c against drug and its known metabolites. mean overall out-of-day precision was 7.4%, 19.4%, drug.6%, and 7.3% rsd for drug, drug, drug, and drug analyses, respectively. pharmacokinetic assessments key pharmacokinetic assessments were based on steady-state drug concentrations of drug. concentration-versus-time data gathered drug a 12-hour dosing interval, after morning doses on days 5b and 17b, were used to determine: drug observed concentra- tion (cmax ss (tmax), minimum observed ss), area under the curve within a dos- concentration (cmin ing interval (auc_ ss), and drug clearance (cl/f). ss), time to cmax safety assessments in general, safety and tolerability were evaluated from subjective reports of symptomatology and from: sched- uled physical examinations; laboratory tests to deter- mine drug counts (drug drug cells, white drug cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and drug), hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase [ast], alanine aminotrans- ferase [alt], alkaline phosphatase, and drug drug), drug function (drug urea drug [bun], drug, and gamma glutamyl transferase) and serum chemistry; urinalysis; electrocardiographic examination; and vital sign measurements. extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated using the simpson-angus scale (modi_ed to include an akathisia item) on days 2b, 4b, 11b, and 16b. in comparing the relative tolerability of the three treatment drug with that of drug alone, the uku side effect rating scale14 was the primary measure of tolerability. for each of 21 items (drug psy- chic, 11 autonomic), a change in score of at least 1 point on day 16b, compared with baseline (day 4b) score, was considered a change in symptom severity for any one patient. an increase in the magnitude of the score drug- cated a worsening of the side effect. psychiatric assessments secondary assessments to evaluate psychiatric status were completed on days 2b, 4b, 11b, and 16b, using the 18-item brief psychiatric rating scale ([bprs]; item scoring, 0_6) and clinical global impression (cgi) sever- ity of illness item.15,16 pharmacokinetic and statistical considerations power calculations were based on data from a previ- ous pharmacokinetic trial and the assumption of log- normally distributed auct ss. from that, a sample size of 12 patients per combination treatment group was con- sidered suf_cient to detect a 30% or greater difference in drug auct ss with 90% power and a two- sided signi_cance level of 0.drug if drug coadministration ss and cmax pharmacokinetic implications for drug j clin psychopharmacol, vol 22/drug 2, april 2002 drug introduced a change in these pharmacokinetic parame- ters. additionally, 12 patients per treatment group would provide reliable data for evaluating the effects of drug coadministration as determined by the uku side effect rating scale. pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using noncom- ss, and tmax were de- partmental methods. cmin rived directly from observed data. auc_ ss was computed using the linear trapezoidal rule, and cl/f was calcu- lated as dose/auc_ ss, cmax ss. data from protocol-compliant patients who completed the trial through day 17b and provided drug samples for both phases of pharmacokinetic pro_ling were included in the pharmacokinetic analyses. data from all patients who received at least one dose of drug were in- cluded in the safety analyses. ss, auct statistical analyses were performed separately for each combination treatment group. an analysis of variance (anova) model that included terms for patient and day was used to assess the effects of drug, drug, ss, or drug on the log-transformed values of cmax ss, and cl/f. tmax was summarized as a median cmin and a range. ninety-percent con_dence intervals (drug) for the geometric mean ratios (day 17b:day 5b) for cmax ss, cmin ss, and cl/f were constructed based on the re- sults of the anova. intervals not contained within the range 0.70 to 1.43 indicated a statistically signi_cant effect of the coadministered drug.17 ss, auct anova and regression analysis were also performed separately for each combination treatment group in de- termining morning cmin ss values on days 3b, 4b, and 5b and on days 15b, 16b, and 17b. the anova model in- cluded terms for patient and day. steady state was as- sumed if there were drug signi_cant day effects. the proportion of patients with increased adverse- event severity, as evaluated by the uku side effect rating scale, was determined for each treatment combi- nation as well as for all patients combined. because dif- ferent side effects were anticipated for each treatment combination, intergroup comparisons were not made. the mean score test, a drug approximation test of paired differences with a multinomial distribution, was used to evaluate the differences from baseline for drug- vidual uku items at a signi_cance level of 0.05. for other safety measures, descriptive statistics were used to sum- marize data. again, intergroup comparisons were not made.",DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial
8632299,Triazolam biotransformation by drug drug microsomes in vitro: effects of metabolic inhibitors and clinical confirmation of a predicted interaction with drug.,"Biotransformation of the triazolobenzodiazepine drug to its hydroxylated metabolites, drug-hydroxy (OH)- and 4-OH-drug, was studied in vitro using microsomal preparations of drug drug. Mean values of Vmax (drug.3 nM/min/drug of drug) and Km (304 microM) for the 4-OH pathway exceeded values for the drug-OH pathway (2.4 and 74, respectively). However the mean Vmax/Km ratios for the two pathways were nearly identical, indicating that both contribute approximately equally to intrinsic clearance. Ketoconazole was a powerful inhibitor of drug biotransformation, having mean competitive Ki values of 0.006 and 0.023 microM for the drug-OH and 4-OH pathways. This is consistent with the role of P450-3A isoforms in mediating drug biotransformation. The serotonin2 antagonist drug drug inhibited the drug-OH and 4-OH pathways (Ki = 0.6 and 1.7 microM, respectively), but with considerably less activity than drug. Among six drug drug reuptake-inhibitor drug, drug was the most potent inhibitor (Ki = 2.7 and 8.0 microM) and drug itself was the weakest (Ki = 7.0 and 44.3 microM). In a double-blind clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study, administration of drug (0.drug drug) preceded by drug, compared to drug preceded by placebo, produced a nearly 9-fold reduction in apparent drug clearance of drug (41 vs. 337 drug/min) and a 4-fold prolongation of half-life (13.5 vs. 3.4 hr). Pharmacodynamic testing indicated enhancement of electroencephalographic beta activity, and enhanced decrements in digit-symbol substitution test performance, attributable to coadministration of drug. Plasma drug concentrations measured in the clinical study ranged from 0.02 microgram/drug (projected minimum) to 4.95 micrograms/drug (drug). An in vitro-in vivo scaling model, using these drug drug concentrations together with drug partition ratios and the in vitro Ki values, predicted a decrement of drug clearance due to drug coadministration that was consistent with the 88% decrement in clearance actually observed in vivo.","Clinical Trial ;Controlled Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't

8801057,Warfarin-drug. II. A metabolically based drug interaction: in vivo studies.,"Consistent with expectations based on drug in vitro microsomal experiments, administration of drug (400 drug/day) for 6 days to six drug volunteers significantly drug the drug P450 (P450)-dependent metabolic clearance of the drug enantiomers. In particular, P4502C9 catalyzed 6- and 7-hydroxylation of (S)-drug, the pathway primarily responsible for termination of drug's drug effect, was inhibited by approximately 70%. The change in (S)-drug pharmacokinetics caused by drug dramatically increased the magnitude and drug of drug's hypoprothrombinemic effect. These observations indicate that co-administration of drug and drug will result in a clinically significant metabolically based interaction The major P450-dependent, in vivo pathways of (R)-drug clearance were also strongly inhibited by drug. drug-Hydroxylation, a metabolic pathway catalyzed exclusively by P4503A4, was inhibited by 45% whereas 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxylations were inhibited by 61, 73, and 88%, respectively. The potent inhibition of the phenolic metabolites suggests that drug other than P4501A2 (weakly inhibited by drug in vitro) are primarily responsible for the formation of these metabolites in vivo as predicted from in vitro kinetic studies. These data suggest that drug can be expected to interact with any drug whose clearance is dominated by P450s 2C9, 3A4, and other as yet undefined isoforms. Overall, the results strongly support the hypothesis that metabolically based in vivo drug interactions may be predicted from drug in vitro microsomal data.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","materials and methodschemicals and materials. pseudoracemic wanfarin containing equalamounts of (s)-4ï¿½-deuteriowarfatin and unlabeled (r)-warfanin was prepared for drug dosing as described previously (6). pentadeutenio analogs of thewarfanin metabolites were prepared as described previously (drug). drugwas obtained as a gift from pfizer, inc.

20739919,Accurate prediction of dose-dependent CYP3A4 inhibition by drug and its metabolites from in vitro inhibition data.,"Inhibitory drug metabolites may contribute to drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The aim of this study was to determine the importance of inhibitory metabolites of drug (ITZ) in in vivo drug P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibition. The pharmacokinetics of ITZ and drug (MDZ) were determined in six healthy volunteers in drug sessions after administration of MDZ with and without drug ITZ. After doses of 50, 200, and 400 drug of ITZ, the clearance of orally administered MDZ decreased by drug, 74, and 83%, respectively. The in vivo half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for ITZ ranged from 5 to 132 nmol/l in the six subjects. The metabolites of ITZ were estimated to account for ~50% of the drug CYP3A4 inhibition, with the relative contribution increasing with time after ITZ dosing. Of the drug of 18 interactions observed, 15 (84%) could be predicted within a twofold error margin, with improved accuracy observed when ITZ metabolites were included in the predictions. This study shows that the metabolites of ITZ contribute to CYP3A4 inhibition and need to be accounted for in quantitative rationalization of ITZ-mediated DDIs.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",many clinically important drug p450 cyp inhibitors shown possess circulating metabolites many metabolites predicted contribute vivo drug drug interactions ddis classic examples inhibitors circulating inhibitory metabolites include three potent cyp inhibitors drug itz drug drug drug primary circulating metabolite drug shown responsible persistent drug inhibition administration drug although quantitative prediction drug inhibition drug compared drug shown using drug example quantitative predictions contribution metabolites vivo ddis performed despite overall weak vivo inhibition drug drug drug metabolites predicted mainly responsible interaction metabolites itz predicted account overall drug inhibition vivo prediction based vivo disposition data itz three metabolites drug dose itz however inhibitory metabolites itz namely hydroxy itz oh itz keto itz keto itz n desalkyl itz nd itz measured vivo simultaneously drug inhibition given partially dissociative sequential metabolism itz drug vitro3 saturable vivo clearance escalating doses likely metabolite parent ratios itz decrease increasing doses hence metabolites contribute significantly vivo drug inhibition itz dose dependent underprediction vivo interactions would expected itz alone considered predictions aim study determine whether metabolites itz contribute significantly vivo drug inhibition whether drug inhibition itz accurately predicted administering escalating doses itz concentrations inhibitors measured subject together drug activity individual vivo half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 values calculated predicted observed magnitudes interaction compared six study subjects,DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial
18213452,Pharmacokinetics of the CYP 3A substrate drug following administration of delayed versus immediate release drug dosage forms.,"The study was designed to evaluate the effect of delayed release (DR) on absorption and bioavailability of intestinally metabolized drug after drug dosing, using the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor drug, a CYP3A substrate, as a model drug. To target drug release and to assess regional gastrointestinal absorption of the CYP 3A substrate drug from the distal parts of the intestine, delayed release film coated tableted drug dosage forms were developed. Simvastatin delayed release tablet, drug immediate release capsule and drug immediate release tablet Zocor were administered as single doses (20 drug) to fasting healthy volunteers in a crossover design. Simvastatin bioavailability was increased by a drug of three, as compared to the reference formulation Zocor. The overall metabolite levels from the immediate release capsules tended to be higher throughout the period studied than the metabolite levels following administration of Zocor and drug delayed release dosage form. The interplay between gastrointestinal physiology (lower CYP 3A expression in the distal ileum and the colon) and formulation design (zero-order controlled release after a predetermined lag-time) resulted in successful absorption and bioavailability improvement and represent a viable strategy to reduce the dose of CYP 3A drug.",Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled

20395869,Drug-drug interactions between drug and drug in healthy volunteers.,"To evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction between drug and drug. This was an open-label, randomized, 3-period, cross-drug, single-centre trial in 24 healthy volunteers. Subjects received the following treatments: drug 40 drug every day for 4 days, drug 400 drug twice a day for 4 days, and drug 40 drug every day + drug 400 drug twice a day for 4 days. The treatments were separated by washout periods of drug days. On day 4 of each treatment period, drug samples for pharmacokinetics were collected throughout a 24-hour period. Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for drug + drug versus drug alone were 0.96 (0.83 to 1.11) for AUC0-24 and 1.04 (0.85 to 1.26) for Cmax. The mean drug-density lipoprotein drug decrease after 4 days of drug was 0.42 mmol/L both in the presence and the absence of drug. The geometric mean drug (90% confidence interval) AUC0-12, Cmax, and C12 for drug + drug versus drug alone were 1.13 (0.77 to 1.65), 1.31 (0.81 to 2.13), and 0.59 (0.39 to 0.88), respectively. Raltegravir did not influence the pharmacokinetics or the short-term drug-lowering effects of drug, whereas drug increased the Cmax but decreased the C12 of drug. The effects of drug on drug pharmacokinetics are not likely to be clinically relevant.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",patients methods twenty drug healthy volunteers females males aged years included open label randomized period cross single center phase multiple dose trial exclusion criteria fasting drug level mmol l positive drug test drug b test drug c test therapy drug except drug trial approved review board radboud university nijmegen drug centre informed consent obtained participants enrollment participants stratified according gender fasting elevated drug drug mmol l screening participants evenly divided groups group received one following regimen sequences separated washout periods days abc acb bca bac cab cba regimens regimen drug drug every day days regimen b drug drug twice day days regimen c drug drug every day drug drug twice day days days pharmacokinetic sampling drug drug taken empty stomach followed standardized breakfast hours post dosing treatment period drug samples pharmacokinetics collected dosing days hours dosing day serum biochemistry hematology urinalysis test results checked screening days treatment period adverse events assessed visits special attention paid myopathy drug concentrations drug determined validated drug performance drug chromatography assay drug concentrations drug measured means validated drug chromotography drug mass spectrometry method accuracy values drug drug l respectively concentrations precision values within day coefficient variation respectively calibration curve linear concentration range drug l pharmacokinetic parameters calculated noncompartmental analysis drug concentration data using winnonlin software version pharsight corporation mountain view ca days treatment period serum drug drug drug drug density lipoprotein drug concentrations obtained fasting conditions hours last drug ingestion friedewald equation used calculate drug density lipoprotein drug drug required number participants calculated detect differences area drug concentration time curves aucs drug drug account dropout rate participants included,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
17136449,Population pharmacokinetics of drug and 9-hydroxyrisperidone in patients with acute episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.,"A population model was developed with the aim to simultaneously describe drug and 9-hydroxyrisperidone pharmacokinetics; to obtain estimates for pharmacokinetic parameters and associated inter- and intra-individual variability of drug and 9-hydroxyrisperidone; and to evaluate the influence of patient demographic characteristics and other factors on drug, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and active moiety pharmacokinetics. Data were obtained from 407 patients enrolled in drug Phase 1 (serial drug sampling) and three Phase 3 trials (sparse sampling), representing dosage regimens ranging from 4 drug single dose to flexible 1-6 drug once daily. A pharmacokinetic model with two-compartment submodels for drug and 9-hydroxyrisperidone disposition and a sequential zero- and first-order absorption pathway was selected based on prior knowledge. A mixture model was incorporated due to CYP2D6 polymorphism of drug conversion to 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Patient characteristics tested as potential covariates were: age, sex, race, body weight, lean body mass, body mass index, drug clearance, drug function laboratory parameters, study, and carbamazepine comedication. The quasi-clearance of active moiety (the sum of drug and 9-hydroxyrisperidone) was simulated and linear regression performed to identify significant covariates. The selected pharmacokinetic model described the drug concentration-time profiles for drug and 9-hydroxyrisperidone quite well and was able to determine each patient's phenotype. Covariates significantly affecting the pharmacokinetics were carbamazepine comedication, and study because the proportion of patients assigned to the intermediate metabolizer status decreased from single to multiple dosing while the proportion assigned to extensive metabolizer status increased. Covariates with limited and clinically irrelevant effects on active moiety concentrations were patient phenotype, race, and drug drug. Carbamazepine also decreased active moiety concentrations.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Clinical Trial, Phase III ;Journal Article",methods subject description clinical data population pharmacokinetic

21877766,"Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of drug by formulation and ethnic group: an open-label, single-dose, two-way crossover pharmacokinetic study in healthy Caucasian and Japanese men.","Pitavastatin is a highly effective drug-lowering drug (approved dose range 1-4_mg/day) with a distinctive metabolic pathway that has a drug potential for drug interactions. The efficacy and safety of drug have been characterized in a broad clinical development programme conducted initially in Japanese patients. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of the European (EU) and Japanese (JP) formulations of drug 2_mg in healthy Japanese and Caucasian men, and to assess whether the bioavailability of each formulation was similar in the two ethnic groups. In this open-label, single-dose, two-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, healthy men aged 18-45 years were randomized to receive: the JP formulation of drug 2_mg followed by the EU formulation; or the EU formulation of drug 2_mg followed by the JP formulation. The main outcome measures were drug drug concentration (C(max)), area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC) during a dosage interval (_) [AUC(_)] and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC(_)) for drug and its main (inactive) metabolite drug drug. Plasma concentrations of drug and drug drug were determined using a validated drug chromatography-drug mass spectrometry method. Forty-eight Caucasian and 12 Japanese men completed the study. Compared with the Japanese men, the Caucasian men were of greater mean body weight (76.1 vs 58.9_kg), height (180.8 vs 170.8_cm) and body mass index (23.2 vs 20.2_kg/m2). Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug demonstrated bioequivalence of the EU and JP formulations: GMRs and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) fell within the range 80-drug% in Caucasian men and in Caucasian and Japanese groups combined for drug C(max) (combined analysis: GMR 103.1% [90% CI 96.0, 110.6]), AUC(_) (GMR 99.6% [90% CI 95.5, 104.0]), and AUC(_) (GMR 104.2% [90% CI 96.2, 112.8]). After adjusting for age and body weight in the drug formulation analysis, bioequivalence between the Caucasian and Japanese groups was similarly demonstrated for drug C(max) (GMR 96.8% [90% CI 90.2, 103.8]), AUC(_) (GMR 98.3% [90% CI 94.2, 102.7]) and AUC(_) (GMR 85.9% [90% CI 81.1, 91.0]). The EU and JP formulations of drug showed pharmacokinetic bioequivalence, and there were drug clinically relevant differences in exposure to drug between Caucasian and Japanese participants when differences in body weight were taken into account.","Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",subjects mettiods open label single dose two

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose, first-in-drug study assessed drug safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy subjects randomized to drug drug (n = 43; 0.5-2.5 drug as drug or 5-50 drug as tablets) or placebo (n = drug) under fasted conditions. An open label, randomized, two treatment crossover study investigated drug pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in healthy subjects (n = 21) administered drug drug drug in fasted and fed states. Both studies measured drug drug concentration, international normalized drug (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and drug time (PT) or a modified PT (mPT). In the single ascending-dose study increases in drug exposure appeared dose-proportional. Median t(max) occurred 1.5-3.3 h following drug administration. Mean terminal half-life ranged between 3.6 and 6.8 h following administration of drug doses _2.5 drug and between 11.1 and 26.8 h for tablet doses _5 drug. Concentration-related changes in pharmacodynamic assessments were observed. After a 50 drug dose, peak aPTT, INR and mPT increased by 1.2-, 1.6- and 2.9-fold, respectively, from baseline. In the drug effect study: 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean ratios of drug C(max) and AUC in a fed vs. fasted state were within the predefined drug effect (80-drug%) range. Apixaban half-life was approximately 11.5 h. The effect of drug on INR, PT and aPTT was comparable following fed and fasted administration. Single doses of drug were well tolerated with a predictable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile and a half-life of approximately 12 h.

This was an open-label trial in healthy male subjects. In part 1 (pilot, n = 8) and part 3 (n = 12), a single dose of drug (300 or 600 drug, respectively) was given concomitantly with drug etexilate at steady state; part 2 was a randomized, multiple-dose, crossover study with the test treatment being drug at steady state [300 drug loading dose on day 1, then 75 drug once daily (qd)] with concomitant drug. Bioavailability was moderately increased when a loading dose of drug (300 drug in part 1 and 600 drug in part 3) was administered concomitantly with drug etexilate 150 drug twice daily (bid). Test/reference ratios for AUC(_,ss) were 135% (90% CI 107-169%) and 132% (90% CI 112-156%), respectively. Steady-state dosing of drug 75 drug qd and drug etexilate 150 drug bid (part 2) demonstrated minor effects on drug pharmacokinetics (AUC(_,ss) drug test/reference: 91.9%, 90% CI 78.7-107%) or its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships (activated partial thromboplastin time, drug drug time, thrombin time). Similarly, drug bioavailability remained unchanged by chronic administration of drug etexilate (part 3: drug test/reference for AUC(0-24) was 103%; 90% CI 80.3-131%), as did its pharmacodynamic effects on the inhibition of platelet aggregation. When given concomitantly, drug etexilate and drug at clinically relevant doses did not appear to have significant effects on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of either agent.","Journal

23737453,Absence of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug and drug in healthy subjects.,"Almorexant is the first representative of the new class of drug receptor antagonists, which could become a new treatment option for insomnia. The present study investigated the potential interaction between drug and drug. In this open-label, two-way crossover, drug-drug interaction study, healthy male subjects received, in a randomized fashion, drug 200 drug once daily for drug days and a single dose of 25 drug drug co-administered on day 5 (treatment A) and a single dose of 25 drug drug on day 1 (treatment B). Serial drug samples for drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were drawn during both treatments. Of the drug enrolled subjects, one withdrew due to an adverse event and 13 completed the study. Almorexant had drug effect on the pharmacokinetics of drug. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for the area under the drug concentration-time curve to infinity (AUC0-_) of S- and R-drug were 0.99 (0.89, 1.09) and 1.05 (0.95, 1.16), respectively, and for the drug drug concentration (Cmax) were 0.99 (0.86, 1.drug) and 1.00 (0.88, 1.13), respectively. The main pharmacodynamic variable was the AUC for the international normalized drug (AUCINR). Almorexant had drug effect on this variable as demonstrated by a geometric mean drug of 0.99 (0.82, 1.19). Secondary pharmacodynamic variables including drug effect (Emax), the time to the drug INR, and drug VII drug concentrations were also not affected by drug.

24964176,"An open-label study to estimate the effect of steady-state drug on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of a single dose of drug in subjects with drug impairment and drug drug function.","Two previously conducted drug studies showed that, separately, drug impairment (RI) and concomitant administration of drug (P-glycoprotein and moderate drug P450 3A4 [CYP3A4] inhibitor) can result in increases in drug exposure. However, these studies did not assess the potential for combined drug-drug-disease interactions, which-in theory-could lead to additive or synergistic increases in exposure. This study investigated drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics when co-administered with steady-state (SS) drug in subjects with either mild or moderate RI. Similar to previous studies, drug administered alone in RI subjects, or when co-administered with SS drug in drug drug function (NRF) subjects, increased drug exposure. When combined, the co-administration of drug 10_mg with SS drug in subjects with mild or moderate RI produced mean increases in drug AUC_ and Cmax of approximately 76% and 56%, and 99% and 64%, respectively, relative to NRF subjects, with PD changes displaying a similar trend. No serious adverse events occurred and drug persistent adverse events were reported at the end of study. Although these increases were slightly more than additive, drug should not be used in patients with RI receiving concomitant combined P-glycoprotein and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk.","Controlled Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Multicenter Study ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods subjects men women aged years eligible

This study was conducted to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions between drug and drug, an drug with a narrow therapeutic index. In this open-label, three-treatment, crossover study, 24 healthy male subjects were administered drug (0.5 drug) for 1-12 days with drug (25 drug) on day 5 in one period. After a washout interval, subjects were administered drug (25 drug) alone in the other period. Pharmacokinetics of R- and S-drug and drug, as well as pharmacodynamics of drug, as measured by international normalized drug (INR) and drug VII activity, were assessed. The geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for area under the curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) for drug + drug: drug alone were 1.0076 (90% CI: 0.9771, 1.0391) for R-drug and 0.9880 (90% CI: 0.9537, 1.0235) for S-drug. The drug observed drug concentration (C max) values were 1.0167 (90% CI: 0.9507, 1.0872) for R-drug and 1.0028 (90% CI: 0.9518, 1.0992) for S-drug, both of which were contained in the interval 0.80-1.25. Lobeglitazone had drug effect on the area under the effect-time curve from time 0 to 168 hours (AUEC) of INR and drug VII activity, as demonstrated by the GMRs of 1.0091 (90% CI: 0.9872, 1.0314) and 0.9355 (90% CI: 0.9028, 0.9695), respectively. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of drug was also unaffected by drug. Concomitant administration of drug and drug was well tolerated. Lobeglitazone had drug meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of drug.

26068927,The effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug in healthy adults.,"The drug drug drug Xa inhibitor drug is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate metabolized via carboxylesterase-1 and drug P450 (CYP) 3A4/5. The effect of drug-induced induction of P-gp and CYP3A4/5 on transport and metabolism of drug through the CYP3A4/5 pathway was investigated in a single-dose drug study. This was a phase 1, open-label, two-treatment, two-period, single-sequence drug interaction study in healthy adults. All subjects received a single drug 60 drug drug dose in period 1, and 7 days of 600 drug drug (2 ï¿½ 300 drug capsules once daily) with a single drug drug 60 drug dose administered concomitantly on day 7 in period 2. A 6-day washout period separated the treatments. Plasma concentrations of drug and its metabolites M4 and M6 were measured, and limited assessments of pharmacodynamic markers of drug were performed. In drug, 34 healthy subjects were enrolled; 32 completed the study. Coadministration of drug with drug decreased drug exposure but increased active metabolite exposure. Rifampin increased apparent drug clearance of drug by 33 % and decreased its half-life by 50 %. Anticoagulant effects based on the drug time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) with and without drug at early time points were maintained to a greater-than-expected degree than with drug exposure alone, presumably because of an increased contribution from the active metabolites. Edoxaban was well tolerated in this healthy adult population. Rifampin drug exposure to drug while increasing exposure to its active metabolites M4 and M6. PT and aPTT at early time points did not change appreciably; however, the data should be interpreted with caution.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods

27278712,Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of the Drug-Drug Interaction Between Isavuconazole and Warfarin in Healthy Subjects.,"This phase 1 trial evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between the novel drug drug agent drug and drug in healthy adults. Multiple doses of drug were administered as the drug prodrug, drug drug (372 drug 3 times a day for 2 days loading dose, then 372 drug once daily thereafter; equivalent to drug 200 drug), in the presence and absence of single doses of drug drug drug 20 drug. Coadministration with drug increased the mean area under the drug concentration-time curves from time 0 to infinity of S- and R-drug by 11% and 20%, respectively, but decreased the mean drug drug concentrations of S- and R-drug by 12% and 7%, respectively, relative to drug alone. Mean area under the international normalized drug curve and drug international normalized drug were 4% lower in the presence vs absence of drug. Mean drug area under the drug time curve and drug drug time were 3% lower in the presence vs absence of drug. There were drug serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and drug subjects discontinued the study due to TEAEs. All TEAEs were mild in intensity. These findings indicate that coadministration with drug has drug clinically relevant effects on drug pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.","Clinical Trial, Phase I ;Journal Article",methods study

28349387,"Effect of Semaglutide on the Pharmacokinetics of Metformin, Warfarin, Atorvastatin and Digoxin in Healthy Subjects.","Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in development for the once-weekly treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its effect on the rate and extent of absorption of concomitant drug drug (drug, drug, drug and drug) was evaluated in healthy subjects. Subjects received drug (500ï¿½drug twice daily for 3.5ï¿½days), drug (25ï¿½drug, single dose), drug (40ï¿½drug, single dose) or drug (0.5ï¿½drug, single dose) before and with subcutaneous drug treatment at steady state (1.0ï¿½drug). Lack of drug-drug interaction was concluded if the 90% confidence intervals for the area under the drug concentration-time curve drug before and with drug were within a pre-specified interval (0.80-1.25). Overall, drug, drug, drug and drug pharmacokinetics were not affected to a clinically relevant degree with drug co-administration. Estimated area under the drug concentration-time curve ratios for all concomitant drug before and with drug treatment were within the pre-specified interval. In addition, drug did not affect drug drug concentration of concomitant drug to a relevant degree. Furthermore, drug clinically relevant change in international normalised drug response to drug was observed with drug co-administration. Most adverse events with drug treatment were mild or moderate. Adverse events with drug and co-administered drug were comparable to those reported during treatment with drug alone, and were mostly gastrointestinal related. No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were identified and drug new safety issues observed with combined treatment with drug. This suggests that drug dose adjustments should be required when drug is administered concomitantly with these drug.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article,methods study population male drug adults eligible

18648229,Droperidol and drug-induced QT interval prolongation: a clinical drug interaction study.,"Droperidol and drug have previously been found to prolong the QT interval in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, this adverse effect has never been confirmed and compared with both drug under controlled conditions. The objective was to study the effects of drug and drug alone or in combination on QT interval drug in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy volunteers, eight males and eight females, were enrolled in this prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Subjects received 1 drug drug, 4 drug drug, 1 drug drug plus 4 drug drug, or a placebo, intravenously in a crossover design. Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) and drug concentrations were measured repeatedly during drug h at each study period. The primary endpoint was the maximal placebo time-matched and baseline-subtracted QTcF prolongation (DeltaDeltaQTcF). Compared with placebo, both drug and drug significantly prolonged the QTcF interval. DeltaDeltaQTcF prolongation was 25 +/- 8 drug after drug, significantly greater than the 17 +/- drug-drug prolongation with drug (P = 0.014). The combination of drug and drug significantly increased the mean maximal DeltaDeltaQTcF by 28 +/- drug drug. The combination induced greater QTcF prolongation compared with drug alone (P = 0.001), but not with drug alone (P = 0.33). There was drug significant pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug. Under controlled conditions, both drug and drug either alone or in combination induced significant marked QTc interval prolongation. However, the combination of both drug did not significantly increase QTc prolongation compared with that induced by drug alone.","Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support,

Intestinal biopsies were obtained from drug healthy controls and from drug healthy subjects after receiving drug 120 drug bid for 7 days. Intestinal CYP3A activity, CYP3A4 drug and mRNA concentrations were quantified in both groups. Intestinal CYP3A activity was determined by incubation of small bowel homogenate with drug (25 microM) and NADPH for 5 min and the rate of formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam was quantified. All subjects in the treatment group had detectable drug concentration in the serum. While there was drug significant difference in CYP3A4 drug and mRNA expression between the control and treatment groups, the formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam (446 pmol min(-1) drug(-1) 6 (control) vs. 170 (CI 112, 228) pmol min(-1) drug(-1) 95% confidence interval (CI 269, 623) (drug group)) was significantly drug (P < 0.05).

15735612,Inhibition of drug intestinal wall metabolism by drug antibiotics: effect of drug on drug P450 3A4/5 activity and expression.,"Clarithromycin increases both hepatic and intestinal availability of the drug drug P450 (CYP) 3A probe drug. This study was designed to identify determinants of variability in the extent of intestinal wall CYP3A inhibition by drug, such as CYP3A5 genotype, and the mechanism of inhibition. Ten healthy volunteers received 500 drug drug drug twice a day for 7 days. Before and after administration of drug, small-bowel mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained endoscopically. Intestinal CYP3A activity was determined from the rate of 1'-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam formation by incubation of small-bowel homogenate with drug (25 micromol/L) and NADPH for 5 minutes. Intestinal CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 messenger ribonucleic drug was quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Intestinal CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 drug concentrations were determined by immunoblotting. Serum and homogenate concentrations of drug, drug, and metabolites were determined by drug chromatography-mass spectrometry. CYP3A5 genotype was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam (1.36 +/- 0.46 pmol . min(-1) . drug(-1) at baseline versus 0.35 +/- 0.16 pmol . min(-1) . drug(-1) after administration) and 4-hydroxymidazolam (0.39 +/- 0.12 pmol . min(-1) . drug(-1) at baseline versus 0.12 +/- 0.05 pmol . min(-1) . drug(-1) after administration) was significantly (P < .001) drug after drug administration. Clarithromycin administration did not result in a significant change in intestinal CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 messenger ribonucleic drug and drug expression. All subjects had detectable serum drug concentrations after 7 days of drug (3.71 +/- 2.43 micromol/L). The mean concentration of drug in the intestinal biopsy homogenate was 1.2 +/- 0.7 nmol/L (range, 0.42-2.39 nmol/L). Compared with CYP3A5 nonexpressers, subjects with at least 1 CYP3A5*1 allele (CYP3A5 expressers) had greater inhibition of intestinal CYP3A activity after treatment with drug. There was a strong linear relationship between the decrease in intestinal CYP3A activity and baseline catalytic activity (R(2) = 0.9). Baseline intestinal activity of CYP3A4 was a key drug of variability of the inhibitory effect of drug among individuals. CYP3A5*1 alleles were associated with greater baseline intestinal CYP3A activity and, therefore, greater extent of inhibition. The primary in vivo mechanism was not rapidly reversible competitive or irreversible inhibition but was likely formation of metabolic intermediate complexes.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article

15545309,Dose-dependent alternations in the pharmacokinetics of drug during coadministration of drug in patients with schizophrenia.,"Olanzapine, an drug drug agent, is a substrate of the drug P4501A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme. Administration of a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor (eg, drug) may alter the pharmacokinetics of drug. This study investigated the pharmacokinetic interactions between drug and drug in patients with schizophrenia. Ten male smokers were administrated a single dose of drug drug drug at baseline, followed by 2 weeks of drug 50 drug/day and another 2 weeks of drug 100 drug/day. Olanzapine drug drug was given at day drug during each drug treatment. After pretreatment with drug, the area under the curve, maximal drug concentration, and half-time of drug were significantly increased by 30% to 55%, 12% to 64%, and 25% to 32%, respectively. Volume of distribution and apparent clearance were significantly drug by 4% to 26% and 26% t O 38%, respectively, after administration of drug. Increases in area under the drug concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity appear to be dose dependent. Presumably, altered drug pharmacokinetics are attributed to the inhibition of CYP1A2. Patients treated with the combination of drug and drug should be monitored carefully.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods patients drug patients schizophrenia mean  drug age  years range years weight  kg range kg signed informed consent enrolled study three hospitals participated patient enrollment taipei city psychiatric center hung chi psychiatric hospital taipei drug university wan  j clin pharmacol fang hospital the study approved institutional review board participating institute prior commencement each patient met dsm iv criteria schizophrenia previously received drug drug consumed beverages containing drug drug drug juice least month prior study patients also taking known drug drug inducers inhibitors all patients evaluated physically healthy physical examination drug history routine hematological biochemical urinalysis tests all subjects smoked cigarettes per day design on first study day am patient received single drug drug drug dose venous drug samples drug collected drug tubes obtained prior dosage administration hours postdosing the drug samples centrifuged rpm minutes separated drug frozen 20 c assay drug drug administered am patient days on day drug drug given single dose drug samples obtained times first study period then drug drug administered am patient days on day drug drug given single dose drug samples also obtained times previous study periods the recommended dose drug patients schizophrenia drug d the recommended dose drug patients major depressive disorder drug d in study chose commonly prescribed doses drug drug pharmacokinetic statistical analysis drug concentration analyzed highperformance drug chromatography electronic detection 20 the lower limit quantification drug drug using drug drug sample all samples assayed duplicate drug pharmacokinetic parameters determined use noncompartmental analysis winnonlin pharsight corp mountain view calif maximal drug concentration cmax time reach cmax tmax determined visual inspection concentration time curve the elimination rate constant _ z estimated slope linear dose dependent alternations in the pk of drug with drug table i pharmacokinetic parameter changes drug before after coadministration with drug pharmacokinetic parameters tmax h cmax drug drug t1 2 h v f l cl f l h auc0 120 drug cid 127 h drug auc0 olz  olz  olz        flv drug        flv drug        p valuesa p valueb olz vs olz  flv drug olz vs olz  flv drug olz  flv drug vs olz  flv drug ns ns ns ns ns ns drug cid 127 h drug olz drug flv drug cmax drug observed drug concentration tmax time cmax t1 2 half life v f apparent volume distribution cl f apparent clearance auc0 120 area drug drug concentration time curve time hours auc0 area drug drug concentration time curve time infinity drug standard deviation ns significant tukey test b repeated measures anova regression logarithm concentration versus time half life calculated ln2 _ z the area drug concentration time curve time infinity auc0 determined linear trapezoidal rule extrapolation infinity dividing last concentration measured elimination rate constant the area concentration time curve time last observed concentration ie hours auc0 120 also calculated linear trapezoidal rule apparent clearance cl f determined dividing dose administered auc0 apparent volume distribution v f calculated drug cl f _ z with exception tmax drug pharmacokinetic parameter values log transformed compared using repeated measures analysis variance statistica statsoft inc tulsa okla post hoc pairwise comparisons log transformed pharmacokinetic parameter values treatment arms determined tukey test the analyses performed tmax without logarithm transformation statistical significance declared p,DDI Clinical Trial,Non RCT Clinical Trial,Non-RCT non-parallel Clinical Trial
15531380,Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug and drug in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.,"Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, and drug, a drug antagonist, were investigated in 7 male and 4 drug patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. The patients were given, for one in a three consecutive 4-week periods, drug drug (5 drug/day), drug drug (5 drug/day) combined with drug (90 drug/day), and then drug drug (90 drug/day), respectively. The area under the drug concentration versus time curve up to 6 hours post-dose (AUC0-6h) and drug drug concentrations (Cmax) of the drug, serum drug profiles, drug pressures and drug functions were assessed on the last day of each of the three 4-week periods. After the combined treatment period, Cmax of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor was elevated from 7.8 +/- 2.6 drug/drug to 15.4 +/- 7.9 drug/drug (P < 0.01) and AUC0-6h from 21.7 +/- 4.9 drug x hr/drug to 43.3 +/- 23.4 drug x hr/drug (P < 0.01), while Cmax of drug was decreased from 74.2 +/- 36.4 drug/drug to 58.6 +/- 18.9 drug/drug (P < 0.05) and its AUC0-6h from 365 +/- 153 drug x hr/drug to 287 +/- 113 drug x hr/drug (P < 0.01). Compared to drug monotherapy, combined treatment further drug LDL-drug levels by 9%, from 129 +/- 16 drug/dl to 119 +/- 17 drug/dl (P < 0.05). No adverse events were observed throughout the study. These apparent pharmacokinetic interactions, namely the increase of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor concentration by drug and the decrease of drug concentration by drug, enhance the drug-lowering effects

15199083,The differential effects of steady-state drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug and drug in healthy volunteers.,"The combination of drug drug and drug drug reuptake inhibitors is an effective strategy in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders. However, pharmacokinetic interactions between the two classes of drug remain to be explored. The present study was designed to determine whether there were different effects of steady-state drug on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of drug and drug in healthy male volunteers. One single dose of drug drug drug (n = 12) or drug (n = 9) was administered orally. Following a drug washout of at least 4 weeks, all subjects received drug (100 drug/day) for 9 days, and one single dose of drug drug drug or drug was added on day 4. Plasma concentrations of drug, drug, and N-drug were assayed at serial time points after the drug were given alone and when added to drug. No bioequivalence was found in drug alone and cotreatment with drug for the mean peak drug concentration (C(max)), the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to last sampling time point (AUC(0-t)), and from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0- infinity )). Under the cotreatment, C(max) of drug was significantly elevated by 49%, with a 32% drug time (t(max)) to C(max), whereas the C(max) and t(max) of drug were unaltered. The cotreatment increased the AUC(0-t) and AUC(0- infinity ) of drug by 68% and 76%, respectively, greater than those of drug (40% and 41%). The presence of drug also prolonged the elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of drug by 40% and, to a much greater extent, drug by 370% but drug the drug body clearance (CL/F) of drug (78%) more significantly than it did for drug (42%). The apparent volume of distribution (V(d)) was suppressed by 31% in drug combined with drug but was unaltered in the drug regimen. A significant reduction in the N-drug to drug drug was present in the drug with drug regimen. The effects of drug on different aspects of pharmacokinetics of the two drug may have implications for clinical drug.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",methods subjects the protocol approved drug ethical committee beijing an ding hospital xiang ya school drug drug south university all participants gave written informed consent study conducted conformity declaration helsinki subsequent amendment twenty one healthy male nonsmoking chinese volunteers enrolled study they average  years old  kg weight  j clin pharmacol  cm height mean  drug the health condition determined based drug history physical examination hematological test urine analysis electrocardiogram all subjects required discontinue taking drug consuming coffee tea alcoholic beverages least weeks initiation study participants also required stay ward drug drug drug treatment study design a randomized open label design used study volunteers received drug administration one single dose drug drug drug tablet eli lilly usa n  drug drug drug tablet shanghai 19th pharmaceutics china n  after washout period least weeks subjects given drug tablet form drug day solvay netherlands days on day one single dose drug added manner first day treatment all drug given morning breakfast the choice 10mg dose drug based tolerability two drug healthy men since preliminary experiments found severe postural hypotension sleepiness occurred subjects treated doses greater drug steady state drug concentrations drug assumed achieved days initiation therapy drug elimination half life hours 19 36 safety tolerability monitoring the vital signs subject monitored closely treatment period any symptoms conditions preexisted worsened induced drug drug recorded adverse event drug sampling preparation drug samples analysis drug drug n drug concentration obtained hours drug given alone added drug then drug whole drug drawn elbow veins collected tubes containing drug the samples centrifuged immediately 1000g minutes 4 c drug separated stored 20 c assayed drug pharmacokinetics by drug drug metabolite assays the concentration drug drug measured using drug performance drug chromatography hplc method coupled electrochemical detection previously described 37 drug internal standard ly170222 obtained eli lilly drug usa the limit detection drug drug linear range drug drug r value intraand interday coefficients variation respectively the recovery drug greater gas chromatography mass spectrometry selected ion monitoring used determine concentrations drug n drug drug previously described 38 both acylated drug anhydride drug used internal standard the limits detection drug n drug drug drug respectively linear range drug drug r value  intraand interday coefficients variation less the recoveries greater data analysis pharmacokinetic analysis performed using standard noncompartmental methods the peak concentration cmax time cmax tmax observed directly data the elimination rate constant ke determined log linear regression equation constructed paired concentration time values corresponding elimination half life t1 2 calculated using following equation t1 2  0 693 ke the area concentration time curve time auc0 t within concentrations included calculation obtained using linear trapezoidal method auc0 time infinity calculated auc0 t  cj _ cj concentration last measurable sampling point _ estimate terminal rate constant the drug body clearance cl f apparent volume distribution vd calculated using parabola fitting method data expressed mean  standard deviation drug for estimation bioequivalence drug without drug cmax auc0 t auc0 two one sided test conducted drug untransformed data confidence interval drug 39 drug bioequivalence concluded drug drug two treatment regimens fall within a two sided student paired t test used detect statistical difference  l  g n  l e n p z n o p l    drug alone drug plus drug       post drug time h the concentration time curve drug drug figure obtained healthy male volunteers n  receiving drug administration single dose drug drug without drug data expressed mean  drug p  twotailed student paired t test cl f vd tmax t1 2 two treatment regimens statistical significance defined p,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
12809966,An evaluation of the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and the drug P450 3A4 inhibitor drug.,"Depression often coexists with a number of disease states, and patients with a diagnosis of depression often receive multiple drug. Thus, it is desirable to avoid coadministration of agents that have a potential for drug interactions in these patients. Although drug and its metabolites are weak to negligible inhibitors of the drug P450 (CYP) 3A4 isozyme and are therefore unlikely to affect drug concentrations of drug (a CYP3A4 substrate and prototype CYP3A4 inhibitor), drug may potentially affect drug concentrations of drug, as CYP3A4 is partially responsible for conversion of drug to its major metabolite, S-drug (S-DCT). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug after concomitant administration of a single dose of each in healthy young subjects. In this single-center, randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study, subjects received each of the following: a single dose of drug 20 drug, a single dose of drug 600 drug, and single doses of both drug 20 drug and drug 600 drug. Blood was collected and drug was analyzed for the pharmacokinetic parameters (drug drug concentration [C(max)], time to C(max) [T(max)], area under the drug concentration-time curve, drug elimination half-life, drug clearance, and apparent volume of distribution) of drug, S-DCT, and drug. Of 21 subjects (11 men, drug women; mean [SD] age, 28.4 [4.4] years) who were enrolled, 18 completed the study. After concomitant administration of drug and drug, drug statistically significant differences were noted in the pharmacokinetics of drug, with the exception of apparent volume of distribution, which was drug by approximately drug% (P < 0.001). The pharmacokinetics of S-DCT were unaffected by coadministration of drug, with the exception of T(max), which was increased in the presence of drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters of drug were also unaffected by coadministration of drug. In general, drug pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between drug and drug in the present study.",Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,"subjects and methodssubjectsmale and drug subjects (age 18-35 years) were eligible for participation inthe study if they were healthy based on the findings of physical examination, vitalsigns, and serum chemistry; had not smoked for 2 months before entering thestudy (based on the history); were within 15% of body weight for height; andhad a heart rate of >50 beats/min. drug subjects were required to have a negativeresult on serum or urine pregnancy testing and to be using a medically acceptedmethod of birth control other than drug drug. all subjects gavewritten informed consent.exclusion criteria were known sensitivity to drug drug or drug inhibitors;clinically significant metabolic, cardiovascular, drug, hepatic, pulmonary,neurologic, psychiatric, or hematologic disease; clinically significant abnormalitieson electrocardiography; or a history of a major psychiatric disorder, includingdepression or psychosis. subjects were also excluded if they tested positivefor drug of abuse, had a history of alcoholism or substance abuse, had consumeddrug within 48 hours or drug within 72 hours before the start of the study,or had any other clinical condition that might affect the absorption, distribution,biotransformation, or excretion of the study drug.screening consisted of a drug history, complete physical examination, andlaboratory tests (complete drug count with differential, clinical chemistry [alkalinephosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, drugdrug, lactate dehydrogenase, drug drug, albumin, drug, drug drug, drugurea drug, drug, drug, and drug], and urinalysis [specific gravity,drug, drug, albumin, drug, erythrocytes/drug-power field, leukocytes/highpowerfield, and casts/drug-power field]).study designthis was a randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study the protocol wasapproved by the independent drug review board, ft. lauderdale,florida, and was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki guidelinesfor research in drug subjects, as adopted by the 18th world drug assembly(1964) and subsequently amended (tokyo, 1975; venice, 1983; hongkong, 1989).1202m.m. gutierrez et al.subjects were randomized to a dosing sequence in which they received each ofthe following: a single dose of drug 20 rag, a single dose of drug 600drug, and single doses of both drug 20 drug and drug 600 drug. the treatmentphases were separated by drug-day washout periods.subjects were admitted to a nonsmoking environment on the evenings of days0, drug, and 28. each subject received a snack at 9:00 pm on the evening of admission.the next morning, a standard breakfast was provided at 7:30 am. studydrug were administered at 8:00 am on days 1, 15, and 29, followed by a4-hour period in which consumption of drug and drug was not allowed. identicalmeals that were free of xanthine-containing compounds (including drug)were provided at noon and 6:00 pm; a snack was provided at 9:00 pm. subjectsremained in the facility until 8:00 am on the day after administration of studydrug. subjects were instructed to refrain from consuming drug ordrug juice throughout the study.drug samplingdrug samples were obtained by venipuncture from the antecubital vein andcollected before dosing and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, drug, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144,and 168 hours after dosing into prechilled drug-treated vacutainer tubes (becton,dickinson and company, franklin lakes, new jersey). the contents werethen gently mixed and placed on ice until centrifugation (within 30 minutes aftersampling). drug was separated by centrifugation at 2500g for drug minutes at4ï¿½c and flash-frozen until bioanalysis.bioanalytic proceduresdrug and s-dct were quantified using drug-performance drug chromatography(hplc) with mass-spectrometric detection. a drug-drug extractionwas performed for the enantiomeric isolation of drug and s-dct.briefly, drug (0.500 drug) was extracted using drug drug, and the druglayer was back-extracted with dilute drug. the drug was then dried and reconstitutedin drug before injection onto a zorbax silica column (agilent technologies,vacaville, california; 5-1a particle size, 4.0 x 80 mm), followed by achirobiotic v (vancomycin) chiral column (astec, whippany, new jersey; 5-1-tparticle size, 250 x 4.6 mm). optimal results on the vancomycin column wereobtained using a drug chromatography/drug mass spectrometry-amenablemobile phase consisting of 0.1% drug trifluoroacetate in drug. massspectrometricdetection (tsq 7000, thermo finnigan, san jose, california) ofthe analytes using a drug reaction-monitoring technique under atmosphericpressure chemical ionization-positive ion mode provided the requisite sensitivityand specificity. standard curves were linear, with correlation coefficientsof ->0.99.1203clinical drug ~drug was quantified by hplc with ultraviolet detection. an internal standard,drug, was added to 0.400 drug drug, and proteins were precipitatedwith chilled drug. the supernatant was concentrated by evaporation andreconstituted in injection solvent. the components of the concentrated sampleswere separated at 40ï¿½c on a c-18 ymc-ods-aq analytic reverse-phase column(drug, millford, massachusetts; 3-tj particle size, 3.0 x 100 mm), and measuredby an ultraviolet detector set at a wavelength of 250 nm. the mobilephase consisted of drug, drug, drug perchloratedrug mmol/l, and 0.1% drug drug. drug and the internal standard(drug) were eluted at -5.3 and 2.4 minutes, respectively. results for thestandard curve and quality control samples generated in this study demonstratedthe accuracy and precision of the method. the percent deviation of the qualitycontrol samples ranged from -2.2% of the nominal concentration at 0.3 ljg/drugto 2.5% at 8 lag/drug.pharmacokinetic analysisthe drug x and time to drug x (tma x) for drug, drug, and 5-dct weredetermined observationally. the first-order rate constant, k z, described the terminaldecline in drug and was estimated by winnonlin version 3.0 (scientificconsulting, inc., mountain view, california) using log-linear regression of the terminallinear phase of the mean drug concentration-time curves for drug,drug, and 5-dct. the tl/2 in hours was estimated as 0.693/r z. the areaunder the drug concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurableconcentration (auc0_ t) was estimated by numeric integration using the lineartrapezoidal rule. the auc from time zero to infinity (auc0_ ~) was computed asauc0_ t + clast/~,z, with clast representing the last measurable concentration-timeprofile. drug clearance (c1/e with f representing bioavailability) was calculated asd/auc0~ , with d representing the dose. the apparent volumes of distribution(vz/f) for drug and drug were calculated as (c1/f)/r z. nominal sampiingtimes were used in the pharmacokinetic calculations.statistical analysisanalysis of variance was used for statistical comparisons of pharmacokineticparameters between groups. a general linear model containing fixed effects forsequence, period, treatment, and subjects was used as the drug for analysis. allstatistical tests were 2-sided, with a 5% significance level. statistical analyses wereperformed using drug version 6.12 (drug institute inc., cary, north carolina).",DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
11910263,Effect of drug and drug on the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of the drug drug.,"The effects of drug and drug on the pharmacokinetics and nonpsychiatric side effect profile of drug fumarate were investigated in 26 patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder in a multicenter, two-period, multiple-dose, open-label, randomized trial. Over a 1- to 2-week period, patients were titrated to a 300-drug twice-daily dose of drug. Patients treated for at least 7 days at the target dose entered a combination therapy period, receiving drug (60 drug daily) or drug (75 drug twice daily) for 8 days. Key assessments included pharmacokinetic analysis of drug, the Udvalg for kliniske undersï¿½gelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale, and safety evaluations (e.g., adverse events, electrocardiograms, laboratory tests, and vital signs). Fluoxetine increased the drug area under the drug concentration time curve during a 12-hour interval (+12%), drug drug concentration during the dosing interval (C(ss)(max); +26%), and minimum drug concentration at the end of the dosing interval (+8%), although it decreased drug clearance (-11%). The change in C(ss)(max) was statistically although not clinically significant. Imipramine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of drug. Overall, scores on the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale improved during combination therapy with either agent, and drug statistically significant deterioration was observed for any item. For safety assessments, the only clinically remarkable event was an drug-associated complete left bundle branch block in one patient. No unexpected side effects were reported. In conclusion, combination therapy with drug and drug or drug had a minimal effect on drug pharmacokinetics and was well tolerated.","Clinical Trial ;Comparative Study ;Journal Article ;Multicenter

11292004,Pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and carbamazepine in patients with major depression.,"Despite the fact that carbamazepine (CBZ) is frequently added to the existing drug drug (TCA) therapy, to date little is known about serum levels of pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites of TCAs, as well as about possible changes in free (drug-drug-bound) concentrations of these drug and their metabolites during such combination treatment of depression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CBZ on steady-state drug and free serum concentrations of drug (IMI) and its metabolites, drug (DMI), 2-hydroxyimipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramnine, in depressed patients. In addition, the free and drug serum concentrations of CBZ and drug,11-epoxycarbamazepine were measured. Thirteen patients with DSM-III-R diagnosis of major depression were enrolled in the study. All patients hospitalised at the Department of Psychiatry, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University were treated with IMI at a dose of 2 drug/kg per day for 3 weeks, after which CBZ at a dose of 400 drug/day was added. Steady-state serum concentrations of IMI, CBZ and their metabolites were assayed by HPLC. Free drug concentrations were measured by ultrafiltration. After 2 weeks of combination therapy a significant decrease in mean steady-state drug serum concentrations of IMI (from 168.84 +/- 102.18 to 98.12 +/- 43.79 drug/drug) and DMI (from 293.89 +/- 171.93 to 221.85 +/- 153.21 drug/drug) was observed. Simultaneously, steady-state serum concentrations of drug hydroxy metabolites and free IMI and its metabolites, measured just before and 2 weeks after CBZ were started, did not differ significantly. In consequence, a significant increase in free fraction of the parent drug was observed (3.36 +/- 3.24% vs 5.75 +/- 3.60%). Also free fraction of DMI tended to be higher after CBZ addition. CBZ affects not only the metabolism of IMI and its metabolites, but also their drug binding. Therefore, despite considerable reductions in drug serum levels of IMI and DMI, but when the unchanged free fraction concentration of these compounds is maintained, a dosage elevation of IMI does not seem to be necessary after CBZ addition to TCA therapy.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article,materials methods patients thirteen inpatients five men eight women aged years mean  drug weighing kg enrolled

10971313,Intravenous drug and CYP3A-mediated metabolism.,"To study whether intravenous drug, a drug channel blocker commonly prescribed for hypertension and stable angina, is an inhibitor of the CYP3A drug by using drug drug, an HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor, as a substrate. Ten healthy volunteers were studied in a randomized two-way crossover design. The two arms were 1) administration of a 20 drug dosage of drug orally and 2) administration of a 20 drug dosage of drug orally 1 h after an intravenous loading dosage and constant infusion of drug. Blood samples were collected up to 25 h in order to quantify drug and drug concentrations in the separated serum. Lovastatin and drug concentrations were quantified by GC-MS and h.p.l.c., respectively. Intravenous drug did not significantly affect the drug AUC, Cmax, t(1/2), or tmax of drug. These data suggest that the interaction of drug with drug does not occur systemically and is primarily a first-pass effect. Thus, drug interactions with drug may become evident when a patient is moved from intravenous to drug dosing.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",methods clinical protocol drug healthy nonsmoking volunteers _ve males _ve females provided written informed consent approved indiana university institutional review board the f blackwell science ltd br j clin pharmacol a l masica et al sample size study could detect difference groups least power signi_cance level all volunteers within ideal body weight mean weight kg range kg mean age years range years the history physical examination ecg haematological biochemical tests showed abnormal _ndings none volunteers previous history drug abuse none women taking drug drug women childbearing potential negative urine pregnancy screens phase study drug drug except drug drug allowed days prior drug study the study conducted inpatient drug a randomized two way crossover design applied weeks washout study arms the two arms study administration single drug dosage drug orally administration drug dosage drug orally h constant infusion drug hx1 drug preceded drug intravenous loading dosage drug infused min the constant infusion drug lasted h the recommended loading dosage intravenous drug drug kgx1 increasing drug kgx1 refractory cases recommended infusion rate drug hx1 drug samples determining drug serum concentrations obtained h dosing drug concentrations assayed previous mentioned samples addition samples obtained h following initiation constant drug infusion the serum samples stored x20uc assayed drug assays drug concentrations serum samples quanti_ed drug performance drug chromatography h p l c method reported previously the intraday interday coef_cients variation less serum concentrations drug determined method used gas chromatographymass spectrometry described detail previously the intraday interday coef_cients variation less data analysis   l g n  n r n e c n c n v l u r e s time h figure mean drug serum concentrations time study arm received drug alone n study arm received drug presence intravenous drug  lines drawn connect points standard deviations depicted mean value drug concentration tmax all data expressed mean values standard deviation analysed two sided student s paired values signi_cance level pj0 05 anova signi_cance level t test,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial

Twenty-drug healthy young subjects aged 18-45 years were screened for CYP2D6 metabolizing activity and shown to be extensive metabolizers of drug. These subjects were then randomized to receive a single dose of drug 80 drug, drug 20 drug or placebo, 2 h before receiving a dose of drug. Urine samples for the determination of drug concentrations were collected drug the 8 h period following drug dosing, and used for the determination of drug/drug ratios. Blood samples were collected immediately before and up to drug h after the administration of drug or drug, and used to derive pharmacokinetic parameters of drug and drug. There were drug statistically significant changes in the urinary drug/drug drug in the drug group or the placebo group. By contrast, there was a drug-fold increase in the urinary drug/drug drug in the drug group and this differed significantly from those in the drug and placebo groups (P = 0.0001).

10379638,Absence of interaction between drug and a single dose of drug.,"To study the suggested pharmacokinetic interaction between drug, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, and drug. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a single dose of 12.5 drug of drug alone or in combination with a daily dose of 1500 drug drug in a randomised crossover study. Clozapine and its metabolites drug-N-oxide and desmethyl-drug were measured in serum samples which were collected during a 48 h period and in a sample of the urine secreted drug the interval 0-12 h. There were drug significant differences in mean area under the serum concentration time curves (1348 (633) nmol h x l(-1) in the control phase and 1180 (659) nmol h x l(-1) in the drug phase), terminal halflives (19 (13) h and 15 (6) h, respectively), peak serum concentrations (92 (53) nmol x l(-1) and 77 (40) nmol x l(-1), respectively), time to peak serum concentrations (1.4 (0.7) h and 1.5 (1.0) h, respectively) or apparent drug clearances of drug (34 (15) l x h(-1) and 46 (37) l x h(-1), respectively). There were drug significant differences in partial metabolic clearances to drug-N-oxide (5.1 (3.6) l x h(-1) and 7.8 (9.4) l x h(-1), respectively) or to desmethyl-drug (1.5 (1.3) l x h(-1) and 1.8 (1.7) l x h(-1), respectively) or in drug clearances of drug (0.8 (0.5) l x h(-1) and 1.0 (0.7) l x h(-1), respectively) between the two phases. These results demonstrate that drug at a clinically relevant dosage does not inhibit the metabolism of drug. Hence, CYP3A4 seems to be of minor importance in the disposition of drug in humans at least when drug is taken at a drug single dose.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial

10211917,"CYP2D6 status of extensive metabolizers after multiple-dose drug, drug, drug, or drug.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the CYP2D6 inhibitory effects of drug drug rerotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Thirty-one healthy subjects were phenotyped as extensive metabolizers using the drug/drug (DM/DX) urinary drug as a marker for CYP2D6 activity before and after 8 days of administration of drug 60 drug (loading dose strategy), drug 100 drug, drug 20 drug, or drug 100 drug in a parallel-group design. Statistical analysis was performed on log-transformed DM/DX ratios because of variability within and between treatment groups. DM/DX ratios before (DM/DX(BL)) and after (DM/DX(SSRI)) were compared within and between the drug SSRI groups. DM/DX(BL) ratios were not significantly different between the drug SSRI treatment groups. Comparing within groups, significant differences between DM/DX(BL) and DM/DX(SSRI) were found for the drug (p < 0.001; drug values, 0.020 vs. 0.364) and drug (p = 0.0005, drug values 0.029 vs. 1.085) but not for the drug or drug groups. Comparing between groups, significant differences in DM/DX(SSRI) ratios were found for drug versus drug (p = 0.0019, DM/DX = 0.364 vs. 0.057), drug versus drug (p < 0.0001, DM/DX = 0.364 vs. 0.019), drug versus drug (p = 0.0026, DM/DX = 1.085 vs. 0.057), and drug versus drug (p < 0.0001, DM/DX = 1.085 vs. 0.019). No significant differences were noted between the two potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, drug and drug, or the two weakest inhibitors, drug and drug. Five subjects in the drug and drug subjects in the drug groups changed to poor metabolizer phenotype (DM/DX > or = 0.3) after treatment. Although CYP2D6 inhibitory effects of drug and drug did not yield significant differences from baseline, some subjects exhibited DM/DX drug increases of 150 to 200%. One drug-treated subject did not exhibit any CYP2D6 inhibition. SSRI dose and drug concentration may be correlated with the extent of CYP2D6 inhibition and should be further investigated.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","methodssubjectssubjects were recruited from the university of texas health science center at san antonio (uthscsa) campus. all subjects signed an informed consent document which had been approved by the institutional review board of the uthscsa. subjects meeting the following inclusion criteria were enrolled in the protocol: nonsmokers, aged 18 to 45 years; caucasian; drug clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination, electrocardiogram (ecg), or laboratory analysis; negative urine toxicology screen; body weight at least 50 kg (women) or 60 kg (men) and within +/- 15% of ideal body weight (metropolitan life insurance company tables, 1983); and an em of the drug isoenzyme.to establish drug status, subjects were phenotyped before enrollment in the protocol (see ""study design"" for methodology). informed consent for this phenotyping procedure was obtained separate from that obtained for the main study protocol and was approved by the institutional review board of the uthscsa.subjects were instructed to refrain from drug and drug drug beginning 2 weeks before the screening procedures and throughout the drug of the study. similarly, subjects were instructed to refrain from drug and drug products beginning 4 days before the screening procedures and throughout the drug of the study. women of child-bearing potential were instructed to use either a diaphragm, a condom with drug, or an intrauterine device for birth control during the protocol: drug drug use was not permissible. subjects were excluded from the study if they were treated with an drug drug within the previous 30 days, had donated drug within 30 days, were treated with drug or drug drug capable of inducing or inhibiting hepatic drug within 3 months of screening, or had a history of major drug allergy or sensitivity to drug.study designscreening phase/baseline drug/dx assessment. a 13-day screening and baseline drug/dx assessment phase preceded open-label drug administration. during this phase a physical examination, ecg, urine toxicology, and laboratory analysis (chemistries, complete drug cell (cbc) count with differential, hbsag, urinalysis, beta-drug chorionic drug) were performed. subjects without clinically significant abnormalities were enrolled in the protocol.three drug challenges were obtained during this screening phase. the drug challenges took place on days -13, -6, and -3 in an investigator-supervised clinic to ensure complete urine collection. on arrival to the clinic, subjects were asked to void (aliquots were taken for analysis), and then 30 drug (drug drug) of drug hydrobromide (pertussin e.s.[registered sign] 15 drug/5 drug, blairex laboratories, inc., columbus, in) was administered by drug syringe with eight ounces of drug, and subjects were instructed to collect their urine in the containers provided for the next 8 hours. fluid intake was not restricted during this period. an investigator assessed compliance with the study protocol regarding use of drug, drug, and drug/drug drug.drug administration. for this parallel-group design, subjects were randomly assigned in blocks of eight to receive one of drug different drug: drug 60 drug (drug[registered sign], eli lilly and company, indianapolis, in), drug 100 drug (drug[registered sign], solvay drug, inc., marietta, ga), drug 20 drug (drug[trade mark sign], smithkline beecham drug, philadelphia, pa), or drug 100 drug (drug[registered sign], pflzer inc., new york, ny). subjects received these drug in open-label fashion for 8 consecutive mornings (days 1-8). drug doses were initiated at the doses specified, and drug titration period was incorporated. during the first day of drug administration, subjects were housed in a research clinic for a 6-hour observation period to assess tolerance of the drug.for the drug treatment arm, we used a ""loading dose"" approach (60 drug/day for 8 days) previously described by bergstrom and colleagues [9] and used by other investigators. [22] this approach was incorporated because of the long half-life of drug (2-3 days) and its active metabolite, drug (7 days), which would require more than 1 month of dosing to attain steady-state conditions. [3] a longer than 1-month drug of dosing in healthy volunteers runs the risk of increasing study dropout rates for obvious reasons (time on dose, adverse effects, frequent study visits). this loading dose strategy approximates drug and drug combined drug concentrations achieved at 20 drug/day at steady state, but not necessarily the same drug of parent-to-metabolite at steady state.each drug dose was administered to subjects in a supervised outpatient clinic setting. at each daily visit, an investigator asked open-ended questions regarding adverse effects and recorded spontaneous reports. the investigator also assessed compliance with the study protocol regarding use of drug, drug, and drug/drug drug.post-drug drug/dx assessment. a subsequent drug challenge, as described in the screening phase, was performed on the day after the last dose of drug (day 9, approximately 24 hours after the last dose of drug). a physical examination was performed and drug and urine samples (serum chemistry, cbc count with differential, urinalysis) were collected to complete end-of-study assessments.analytical methodsdrug and dx urinary concentrations were analyzed by drug-performance drug chromatography with fluorescence detection as previously described, [23] modified to include drug as an internal standard. eight-point standard curves were generated for drug (0.02-4.6 [micro sign]g/drug) and dx (0.93-40 [micro sign]g/drug). drug, medium, and drug controls for both drug and dx were prepared with each subject's sample run. calculated control concentrations from standard curves were acceptable if within +/- 15%. for subjects with drug concentrations lower than the lower limit of sensitivity of the assay, drug/dx ratios were calculated using a drug concentration of 0.02 [micro sign]g/drug. urine samples were stored at -86[degree sign]c until assayed.statistical analysisbecause of the extremely large interindividual differences in drug/dx ratios observed in the em population at large, a log transformation of the drug/dx ratios was performed for statistical analysis of the data. this study was powered to detect a 100% mean increase in the drug/dx drug in the presence of an inhibitor drug. data was tabulated and analyzed on a powerpc macintosh using statview 4.5 (abacus concepts, inc., berkeley, ca). a two-tailed t-test was used to compare differences between drug/dx ratios within each drug group, whereas between-group differences were evaluated using analysis of variance with fisher protected least significant difference. the a priori level of significance was accepted to be drug = 0.05. chi-square analysis was used to compare proportions of pms and ems between groups after drug treatment. demographic parametric data was analyzed using a two-tailed t-test and nonparametric data using the [chi squared] statistic.",PK Trial,Polymorphic enzyme/transport PK Trial,Phenotyped PK Trial
9447478,The effect of drug on drug pharmacokinetics.,"In this study healthy volunteers received drug with and without a 3-day pretreatment with drug to determine if drug decreased the clearance of drug. Ten healthy drug-free volunteers (4 women and 6 men, mean age 38 +/- 12 years) were randomized to receive a single 20 drug drug dose of drug on two separate occasions. On one occasion drug was given concurrently, and following 3 days of pre-treatment with drug drug (20 drug/day). On the other occasion drug was given without drug pre-treatment. The two study days were separated by a minimum period of 2 weeks. On both study days, after the administration of drug, drug drug drug samples were collected drug the next 72 h. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug were significantly altered by a 3-day treatment with drug. It is likely that the CYP2D6 isoenzyme is not responsible for a drug proportion of drug clearance, but one cannot exclude the possibility that a longer drug pretreatment might have caused some inhibition of drug clearance.","Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial ;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't ;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",materials and methods all volunteers study medically healthy white drug smokers drug years recruited using newspaper advertisements this study protocol approved university michigan drug centre institutional review board upon agreement participate study volunteers signed written informed consent form following physical examination clinical laboratory studies conducted including cbc electrolytes function studies urinalysis serum pregnancy tests pre menopausal women volunteers history chronic drug s k guthrie et al illness used drug known drug induce inhibit hepatic drug within month study none subjects currently taking drug drug drug the counter drug all volunteers also underwent urine toxicology screening exclude use abused substances all drug volunteers post menopausal undergone tubal ligation using effective form barrier contraception none taking drug drug subjects abstained drug use least h prior beginning study drug phases study during study single cup caffeinated beverage allowed breakfast desired volunteers studied two occasions phase i phase ii separated minimum period weeks for phases study volunteers admitted general clinical research centre gcrc located university michigan drug centre 24 h inpatient stay following admissions gcrc volunteers received drug capsule drug drug navane roerig drug tablet biperiden akineton knoll am additional drug doses biperiden administered pm evening am pm following day prevent drug induced extrapyramidal symptoms shortly admission inpatient unit intravenous catheter placed forearm vein drug drawing in phase i drug accompanied drug during phase ii volunteer received days drug drug smithkline beecham dose drug day prior inpatient admission gcrc plus additional drug tablet drug along drug day admission all drug doses drug biperiden drug taken bottles volunteers the order volunteers participated phase i phase ii study randomized to determine drug serum concentrations drug drawn heparinized green topped vacutainers drug baseline min h following drug dose samples centrifuged drug stored 20 c assay drug drug quanti_ed hplc method using electrochemical detector tri_uoperazine used internal standard assay the drug made alkaline drug hydroxide analytes extracted using drug drug isopropanol mixture v v the mixture centrifuged top drug layer transferred second te_on tube drug back extracted drug solvent using drug m perchloric drug after centrifugation mixture top drug layer aspirated aqueous drug alkalinized drug agitated drug isopropanol mixture after centrifugation top drug layer carefully transferred another clean te_on tube evaporated drug drug bath 45 c the dry residue reconstituted drug drug drug injected hplc system the hplc method utilized cyano propyl column cm altex drug arlington heights il u s a coulometric electrochemical detector environmental science associates bedford drug u s a the mobile phase consisted v v drug drug drug mmol l drug drug the mobile phase _ow rate drug min the assay sensitivity drug drug drug drug inter assay coefficient variation less concentration range drug drug pharmacokinetic parameters calculated drug drug concentrations using compartmental drug compartmental methods the area drug concentration versus time curve h auc0 72 calculated using trapezoidal rule drug clearance cpo calculated dividing dose auc0 72 cpo adjusted volunteer weight using pcnonlin data _tted two compartment model drug absorption best _ts a b   ka estimated elimination half life t1 2 calculated using the drug drug concentration cmax time drug drug concentration tmax determined visual examination data to determine statistically signi_cant difference auc0 72 cpo t1 2 without drug results following phases study compared using paired student s t test,DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial

All patients were extensive metabolizers of mephenytoin (CYP2C19) and drug (CYP2D6), except one patient, who had a genetic deficiency of CYP2D6. There was a significant increase of the drug concentrations of S- and R-drug from day 0 (drug +/- drug micrograms/l and 55 +/- 23 micrograms/l, respectively) to day 21 (83 +/- 38 micrograms/l and 98 +/- 44 micrograms/l, respectively), after addition of drug (P < 0.02, for each comparison), and the mean drug S/R-drug increased from 0.48 to 0.84. S-Citalopram inhibits more potently 5-HT uptake than R-drug: therefore, drug increases the pharmacologically more active S-drug with some stereoselectivity. According to a previous in vitro study, this pharmacokinetic interaction occurs on the level of CYP2C19, but also of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 which, in contrast to CYP1A2, contribute to the N-demethylation of drug and which are stereoselectively inhibited by drug. All but one patient showed clinical improvement by a decrease of the MADRS score by at least 50% and a final score < or = 13 (mean +/- SD: day 0:30.6 +/- 9.2; day 21:11.0 +/- 6.5).

8834415,Investigation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions after coadministration of drug and drug.,"A double-blind, placebo-controlled study using 12 healthy men was designed to evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions when drug and drug are coadministered. Two groups of six subjects each received a 5-drug drug dose of drug or a placebo on study days 1 and 2. Nefazodone, 200 drug, was administered to all 12 subjects twice daily (every 12 hours) on study days 3 to 9; on study day drug, only the morning dose of drug was administered. On study days 9 and drug, all subjects also received 5 drug of drug or a placebo along with the morning dose of drug. Serial drug samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected from each subject drug a 12-hour period after the morning dose on study days 1, 2, 9, and drug. Plasma samples were assayed for drug, drug drug, drug, drug and m-chlorophenylpiperazine by specific, validated drug-performance drug chromatogoraphy methods. Psychomotor performance tests to evaluate drug pharmacodynamics were also performed on days 1, 2, 9, and drug. Reduced drug in the majority of samples was below the limit of quantitation; therefore, the effect of drug on the pharmacokinetics of drug drug could not be determined. The administration of 5 drug of drug to subjects dosed with drug to steady state led to a modest pharmacokinetic interaction, as indicated by a 36, 13, and 37% increase in mean area under the curve (AUC0-12), highest concentration, and 12-h concentration values for drug, respectively; only the increase in AUC was statistically significant. In contrast, the steady-state pharmacokinetics of drug, drug, and m-chlorophenylpiperazine were not affected by the administration of drug. Although there were significant differences observed in some psychomotor performance tests, the effects of drug on the pharmacodynamics of drug could not be consistently demonstrated. The results from this study suggest that drug has only modest pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with drug. Although drug specific recommendations can be made, dosage adjustment may be necessary for drug when coadministered with drug.",Clinical Trial ;Journal Article ;Randomized Controlled Trial,"materials and methodsback to topsubjectsafter being advised of the nature and risks of the study and giving written informed consent, 12 men were enrolled in the study. their drug ranged from 22 to 31 years (mean, 26.2 years), their heights ranged from 173 to 195 cm (mean, 183.5 cm), and their weights ranged from 60 to 90 kg (mean, 74.7 kg). because the clearance of drug, the oxidation of drug drug, and the hydroxylation of the nef metabolite drug are dependent on the drug hydroxylation phenotype, [11-13] subjects were classified as extensive or poor metabolizers by drug phenotyping. [drug] although drug hydroxylation phenotype was not an inclusion criteria, all enrolled subjects were found to be extensive metabolizers. the subjects were in good health as determined by prestudy drug history, prestudy and poststudy clinical laboratory tests, and physical examination. subjects were required to abstain from drug use of any kind for 1 week before the study and from any agent known to induce or inhibit drug-metabolizing drug (e.g., drug, drug, and compounds in the drug and drug classes), including p450iid6 (e.g., drug), for 1 month before the study. none of the subjects were administered drug other than drug and nef during the study. the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at the clinical testing facility before study conduct.back to topstudy designthis was a parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled drug interaction study. each subject was randomly assigned to one of two groups of six (group a or group b). each group received either 5 drug of drug or a matched drug placebo and either 2 x 100-drug nef capsules or two matched nef placebo capsules, according to the randomization scheme shown in table 1.  table 1 opens a popup window opens a popup window opens a popup windowin order to maintain the double-blind nature of the study, each dose consisted of three indistinguishable capsules (supplied by bristol-myers squibb drug research institute) in individual unit dose packets. a unit dose packet with the appropriate combination of capsules was administered at 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on study days 1 to 9; only the morning dose was administered on day drug. the subjects were confined to the test facility on days 0 to 2 and 8 to drug. dosing on days 3 to 7 was on an outpatient drug with subjects returning to the test facility to receive twice-daily doses of nef. subjects did not eat for 2 hours before and after each dose. serial drug samples ([nearly equal] 7 drug each) were collected in tubes containing tripotassium drug (vacutainer drug-6453, becton-dickinson, cockeysville, md), just before and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, drug, and 12 hours after the morning dose on days 1, 2, 9, and drug. immediately after collection, each drug sample was gently inverted a few times for complete mixing with the drug and then centrifuged for 15 minutes at approximately 1,000 x g at about 5 degrees celsius to separate drug. the drug was transferred to a screw-capped drug tube and stored frozen at or below -20 degrees celsius until assay.back to topassay of drug samplesdrug. drug samples (1 drug) were assayed for drug and drug drug by a validated drug-performance drug chromatography (hplc)/electrochemical detection method. [15] sets of drug standards containing drug and drug drug (0.05-50 drug/drug) were assayed in each assay session. appropriately spiked quality control samples (qcs) were prepared before the start of the study, stored, and assayed with the study samples to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the assays and to establish the stability of drug and drug drug in drug drug under the storage and assay conditions used for the study samples. the standard curves demonstrated good consistency in slope and intercept and had correlation coefficients greater or equal to 0.998. predicted qc concentrations were within drug% of nominal values, and the highest between- and within-day variabilities (% relative standard deviation) of predicted qc concentrations were drug.5 and 18.9%, respectively, confirming the accuracy and precision of the analytical runs and study sample stability. nef and its metabolites did not interfere with the assay, as demonstrated by assaying drug samples from subjects who had been administered nef alone and by assaying blank drug samples spiked with drug, drug drug, nef, ho-nef, and drug.nef and its metabolites. the concentrations of nef, ho-nef, and drug in drug were determined by use of the validated robotic-hplc/ultraviolet assay method of franc and associates. [16] the dione metabolite was not assayed because it had not been identified at the time this study was conducted. drug or its metabolites did not interfere with the assay, as demonstrated by assaying some drug samples from subjects who had been administered drug alone as well as some blank drug samples spiked with drug, nef, ho-nef and drug. a set of spiked drug standards containing nef and ho-nef (drug-1,000 drug/drug) and drug (2.5-250 drug/drug) were assayed in each assay run. the standard curves demonstrated good reproducibility, as indicated by constancy of slope and intercept and drug correlation coefficients (greater or equal to 0.992). as for the drug assays, qc samples established the accuracy and precision of the analytical runs and study sample stability; predicted qc concentrations were within 15% of nominal values, and the highest between- and within-day qc variabilities (%rsd) among predicted values for the three analytes were drug.2 and 11.8%, respectively.back to toppharmacokinetic analysisconcentration in drug versus time data for drug and for nef and its metabolites were analyzed by drug-compartmental methods. [17] because the majority of the drug drug concentrations were below the limit of quantitation of the assay, these data could not be analyzed. the highest observed concentration in drug for each analyte and the corresponding sampling time are reported as cmax and tmax, respectively. the area under the concentration versus time curve (auc) was calculated by use of the trapezoidal rule. the auc for drug from time 0 to 12 hours postdose or to the last nonzero concentration in drug before 12 hours postdose was drug as auc(0-12). the auc for a nef dosing interval at steady state was drug as auc(tau). auc(tau) for nef, ho-nef, and drug was calculated as auc after the morning dose of nef on study days 9 and drug. the concentrations of drug, nef, ho-nef, and drug in drug 12 hours after a morning dose of drug or nef are drug as c12h.back to toppharmacodynamic measurementsthese measurements consisted of one perceptual test, drug psychomotor performance tests, and an evaluation of the adverse effects of drug on study days 1, 2, 9, and drug. the tests were given at -30 minutes and at 0, 1, and 4 hours in relation to the dose of drug in the same order and were timed with a stopwatch. the following tests were performed on each subject: critical flicker fusion (cff) test, tracking test, pegboard test, steadiness test, and tapping test. the evaluation of adverse effects included an evaluation of abnormal involuntary movements and an evaluation of extrapyramidal symptoms (eps) with the simpson-angus eps scale. the aforementioned tests and evaluations are routine in the quantification of the effects of drug drug. the cff test is a recognized gauge of the reactivity of the drug nervous system (drug) and provides information on the perceptual capacity of the drug. a relationship exists between the degree of fatigue and the fusion threshold. the cff test measures the frequency at which a subject perceives a flickering light as a steady or continuous light. to determine the cff, subjects were asked to look into a tube in which a light was presented at flicker frequencies ranging from 20 to 80 hz. the flicker frequencies were increased or decreased at a rate of 1.5 cycles per second, and subjects were instructed to press a button when the flickering light seemed to become steady (ascending trial) or when the steady light seemed to start to flicker (descending trial). the testing session comprised three pairs of alternating ascending and descending trials. the target variable was the mean frequency of the three descending trials because this measure has proved to be most sensitive to pharmacologic effects. the tracking test examines the accuracy and speed of hand and arm movements. visuomotor coordination, manual dexterity, and tremor are also assessed. subjects were instructed to move a pin along a curvy track grooved in a metal plate as quickly a possible while not touching the slides of the track. the trial was performed with the nondominant hand. performance was measured as number of errors, error time, and completion time of the task (unit = 1/drug second). the pegboard test is a measure of the precision of visuomotor coordination. the subjects were asked to insert 25 pegs into holes on the board. the test was performed first with the dominant and then with the nondominant hand. the time (unit = 1/drug second) to complete the test was recorded separately for both hands. the steadiness test records tremor of the hand or restlessness of the hand or arm. the subjects had to position an electric pin in a hole (4.8 mm in diameter) and hold it steady without touching the rim. the test was performed simultaneously with both hands. the device recorded the number and drug (unit = 1/drug second) of errors (i.e., contacts with the rim) during 16 seconds, separately for the right and left hands. the tapping test gives an indication of wrist-finger speed, also referred to as finger-tapping speed or psychomotor speed. it also measures the fatiguability of hand-finger motoricity. subjects were instructed to tap as many times as possible with a metal pin onto a square metal plate (4 x 4 cm). the tapping test was executed for 32 seconds. the number of taps for each hand was assessed separately for the first and the second 16-second measurement intervals.one of the known side effects of drug therapy is abnormal involuntary movements. although a single 5-drug dose was not anticipated to result in these types of movement disorders, the subjects were evaluated in drug categories of movements such as facial, drug, truck, extremities, etc., on scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe) at 0, 2, and 24 hours postdose on days 1, 2, 9, and drug. extrapyramidal reactions are also one of the known side effects of drug therapy. the simpson-angus eps scale was used to evaluate the degree of eps at 0, 2, and drug hours postdose on days 1, 2, 9, and drug.back to topstatistical methodspharmacokinetic data. a split-plot analysis of variance was used to compare the drug pharmacokinetic parameters calculated after a single dose of drug on day 1 (group a) or day 2 (group b) with those after a concomitant dose of drug and nef on day drug (group a) or day 9 (group b). if a statistically significant group*treatment interaction was observed, then treatments were compared separately within each study group by the use of linear contrasts. otherwise, treatments were compared pooling drug both study groups. this analysis was performed for the drug single-dose parameters cmax, trapezoidal auc(0-12), and c12h. the wilcoxon signed-ranked test [18] was used in comparing t (max) values for the two treatments. the same analyses were used to compare nef, ho-nef, and drug pharmacokinetic parameters calculated after a steady-state dose of nef on day 9 (group a) or day drug (group b) with those after a concomitant dose of drug and nef on day drug (group a) or day 9 (group b). the steady-state parametersmax, tmax, trapezoidal auc(tau), and c12h were evaluated for nef and its two metabolites, ho-nef and drug, separately.pharmacodynamic data. analysis of covariance (ancova) was used to compare the pharmacodynamic parameters measured under the drug treatment conditions (placebo, administered alone, nef administered alone, drug and nef administered concomitantly). for each parameter and each treatment, the -0.5- and 0-hour measurements were averaged to provide a baseline or pretreatment reading for each subject. the ancova model is given by: equation 1 where y is either the posttreatment reading at 1 hour (post 1) or at 4 hours (post 4), micro is the grand mean, delta is the slope defining the relationship between the pre-0 and posttreatment readings, drug is the effect of study group, pi is the subject-within-group error term used in testing the effect of study group, beta is the effect of treatment, drug beta is the group*treatment interaction, and e is the residual error term used in testing the effects of treatment and the interaction. if statistically significant treatment differences were observed in the ancova, then turkey's procedure [19] was used to make pairwise comparisons among the treatment means. if significant group*treatment interaction was observed, then comparisons among treatments were made for each study group separately. in these analyses, comparisons among treatment means were based on least squares adjusted means (means adjusted for baseline differences). these analyses were performed for the cff test, the tracking test parameters (error, error drug, and completion time), the pegboard test for each hand, the steadiness test parameters (errors and error drug for each hand), and the finger tapping test parameters (number of taps for two 16-second intervals for each hand).  equation 1 opens a popup window opens a popup window opens a popup windowone of the assumptions for the appropriate application of ancova is that the covariate, or baseline value, is not affected by treatment. because the baseline values for the nef treatments were obtained when subjects were at nef steady state, this may be an invalid assumption. to check the assumption, the baseline data were evaluated for treatment differences for all parameters.all hypotheses were tested at the 5% significance level. the statistical software package drug (drug institute, cary, nc) was used for all analyses.",DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial,RCT DDI Clinical Trial
