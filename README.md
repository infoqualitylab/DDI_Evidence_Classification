# DDI_Evidence_Classification
Combine machine learning and knowledge representation to facilitate the process of assessing evidence from studies of drug-drug interaction by using an existing ontology of evidence types (e.g. DDI clinical trials vs. pharmacokinetic trials), as the backbone to develop a series of classifiers that categorize a DDI studyâ€™s evidence type based on its textual characteristics.
